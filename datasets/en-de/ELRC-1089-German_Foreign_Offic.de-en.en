Foreign Minister Steinmeier shocked by the attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul 
On the morning of New Year’s Day (1 January), Foreign Minister Frank‑Walter Steinmeier said: 
We condemn this act and every form of terrorism in the strongest possible terms. 
At this difficult time, we stand side by side with Turkey. 
We offer the families and friends of the victims our heartfelt sympathy. 
Once again, innocent young people in Turkey who, like millions of others throughout the world, simply wanted to come together to have fun and enjoy seeing in the New Year have become victims of an appalling and cowardly attack. 
The ceasefire that has now been agreed between Turkey and Russia can only hold if other regional actors such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are involved. 
And it has also been clear to us all along that there can be no political solution for Syria without the involvement of Moscow and the important regional powers. 
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura has already announced this and has welcomed the new ceasefire with this in mind. 
While this gives us renewed hope, we must be on our guard, however. 
We also recently set aside another 55 million euros for eastern Aleppo in order to provide the civilian population fleeing the city with basic necessities. 
However, experience since then has shown one thing in particular, which is that, in the absence of genuine political negotiations, it is only a matter of time before a ceasefire in Syria collapses and the bloodshed continues. 
This mustn’t be allowed to happen again –

I am shocked by the events of New Year’s Eve on the Bosphorus. 
I wish the many people who have been so badly injured a full and rapid recovery. 
We already agreed to a ceasefire on that occasion. 
The news about the ceasefire shows us that this is possible if there is political will on all sides. 
From a political point of view, the Minister said, Germany had sent a clear message 
What will you remember the most? 
The trips were definitely among the moving moments – 
“trips I would describe as unique, even after so many years as Foreign Minister. 
We had a chance to see for ourselves what the members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission do there.” 
In an interview with the “Passauer Neue Presse” (published on 31 December 2016), Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke about the prospects for a ceasefire in Syria: 
Isn’t President Putin playing a game of cat-and-mouse with the Western negotiating partners nonetheless? 
How can a permanent end to the war be achieved? 
Do you remember the talks on Syria in Munich in February? 
“We knew we were taking on the Chairmanship in truly turbulent times,” said Steinmeier, 
summing up: “As expected, many conflicts and crises kept us on our toes.” 
We are already doing a great deal to this end and are taking the lead internationally. 
We have always worked to try and bring about a ceasefire at long last, after six years of bloody and brutal civil war in Syria. 
For example, the issue of war and peace had returned to the OSCE area since the annexation of Crimea and the military conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
“Naturally, this had a strong impact on us during our year as Chair.” 
We do not yet know all of the details about the agreement, and it appears that a number of key points have not yet been fully clarified.

Only in the coming few days will we be able to tell whether the agreement is holding. 
First and foremost, said Foreign Minister Steinmeier, he was proud of his team. 
At any rate, it must be clear also to Russia that there can be no military solution in Syria in the long term. 
It is also important to ensure humanitarian access to all besieged areas without delay and that such access no longer be the exception. 
Of course, he was also grateful for the work of the OSCE Secretariat and “the many women and men in the field missions who work every day under difficult circumstances”. 
The fact that both the Syrian Government and representatives of Syrian opposition groups have agreed to a nationwide ceasefire is an encouraging sign. 
And “the connectivity conference was the first time we managed to truly include business people in the OSCE process”. 
What advice do you have for the incoming OSCE Chair? 
“The OSCE is more relevant today than it has been for decades.” 
Since 2012, we have provided over 2.6 billion euros in support of the Syrian crisis, over half of which has been for humanitarian aid. 
What can be done to ensure that the humanitarian disaster does not get even worse and that those in need can finally receive aid? 
The complete interview with Foreign Minister Steinmeier will be published in the “Passauer Neue Presse” on 31 December 2016. 
At the same time, setting political negotiations in motion as soon as possible on the basis of UN Resolution 2254, which outlines the framework for a peaceful solution, remains a priority. 
2017 must be a year of hope for the people in Syria and the many millions of Syrian refugees. 
From 1 January to 30 June 2017, Malta holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union. 
Mr Steinmeier, in foreign policy, crises have become the “new normal”. This has been true especially during your term of office. 
Why does 2017 give cause for optimism? 
It is true, we do live in turbulent times. 
Those of us who work in foreign policy have been in permanent crisis mode for at least three years now. 
Crises do appear to be the new normal. 
However, we should not forget that there are rays of hope! 
Look, for example, at Colombia. 
After a bloody civil war that drove millions of people from their homes, there is now finally a real prospect of peace. 
The fact that this ceasefire is more or less holding raises cautious hope for the people in Syria. 
You have said that the door to diplomacy must never be closed. 
Is diplomacy in some respects naive? 
Diplomacy is many things, but certainly not naive. 
it would be naive to believe that military means are suitable for solving Syria’s deep-rooted problems. 
Russia is also aware of this. 
That was certainly one of the motivating factors for recent negotiations with Turkey on a ceasefire. 
Regarding your question about Western military intervention, it is easy to make demands if you must not yourself bear the consequences. 
But the question should first be asked whether recent military intervention, for example in Iraq or Libya, has led to more stability and security. 
And has it? 
Libyan arms have played a significant role in the conflict in Mali, which we are now painstakingly trying to resolve and where we have deployed German soldiers with a view to supporting this process. 
The situation in the Middle East has escalated following a recent UN decision. 
Is the construction of settlements endangering the two-state solution? 
Only if both sides take concrete steps will a political horizon even come back into sight that will open up the possibility of a resumption of negotiations. 
Unfortunately, the possibility of this happening has not increased recently. 
What benefits has this process brought during recent crises? 
When the world changes, diplomacy, too, must change. 
And our efforts bore fruit. 
Overall, we are better prepared today for tackling complex crises than we were three years ago. 
Thanks to the review process, we have added quite a few tools to our foreign policy toolbox. 
In the city of Tikrit, for example, 90 percent of the displaced population has been able to return. Only nine months ago, Tikrit was still under ISIS control. This success was achieved also thanks to our help. 
This year, Germany will host the G20. 
What message should the meeting send? 
We do not want to simply be at the whim of globalisation. 
We want to actively shape it in beneficial ways. 
That is the responsibility we are assuming with the G20 Presidency, which rests on three pillars: 
Foreign policy must be more than just crisis management. 
We must also work to shape the overarching aims of our policies, and we must together with other countries develop strategies for the direction we want this world to take. 
Looking back at your tenure as Foreign Minister, what are you particularly proud of? 
In diplomacy, progress is often much less conspicuous. 
We have concluded an agreement with Iran after many years of tedious negotiations, preventing Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
Looking back at nearly eight years as Foreign Minister, I can see that German diplomacy is increasingly sought-after and respected. 
These days, must Germany’s head of state be more internationally-minded? 
First of all, it will be up to the delegates of the Federal Convention to make their decision on 12 February. 
Interview: Michael Bröcker 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier reflects on Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2016 
What’s important now – and I cannot say this often enough – is that the parties to the conflict must ensure humanitarian access to all besieged areas without delay, and they must stop obstructing the aid workers. This is more urgent than ever now, during the winter! 
Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2016: 
at the turn of the year, following twelve intensive months as Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Foreign Minister Steinmeier passed the baton on to his Austrian colleague. 
Bild: Foreign Minister Steinmeier, OSCE Chairperson-in-Office As OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Steinmeier chaired the Ministerial Council © Photothek/Gaertner 
Syria: “For true prospects for peace, more will be required” 
Taking on the OSCE Chairmanship was a “major project”, said Steinmeier, involving over 300 events in Vienna, Berlin, Potsdam, the entire OSCE area, and not least the grand finale in Hamburg, the Ministerial Council in December. 
How do you rate the prospects of the new ceasefire in Syria? 
But he was also proud of the fact that “we managed to introduce new topics, despite all the disagreements, entrenched positions, difficult debates and day-to-day crisis management” – 
for example, the initiative on arms control. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier Foreign Minister Steinmeier at the Meeting of OSCE Foreign Ministers: 
Yet it is through non-involvement of the Western Alliance that the killing by Russian and Syrian troops in Aleppo has been able to continue. 
In Libya, we are still working to establish something that more or less resembles state order – which completely fell apart after the 2011 intervention. 
The effects can be felt not only in Libya, but in the entire region. 
“We will not leave the new Chair to cope with this difficult task on its own. And as part of the Troika, we will be happy to provide advice and support on request.” 
“that we believe in effective multilateral organisations, especially now in these times of turbulence, upheaval in the international order and, all over the world, the resurgence of nationalism” and “that we are willing to actively take on responsibility in such situations”. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier takes a very personal look back over the year 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier wished his successor as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for 2017, his Austrian counterpart, “all the best, a sure hand and above all the necessary patience to get a result in worthwhile discussions and coordination processes”. He gave this assurance: 
This idea resonated with me when I returned to the Federal Foreign Office in 2013. So I decided to initiate the review process. 
... where we have prevented the war from spreading to all of Ukraine and possibly even further afield. This often required difficult marathon rounds of negotiation with no sleep, setbacks and a great deal of frustration when implementation of the Minsk agreements made only incremental progress. 
In February, you will be standing for election as the new Federal President. 
Continuation of settlement activities in the occupied territories calls into question the fundamental idea of a two-state solution. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier talks to the newspaper Rheinische Post (interview published on 2 January 2017). 
We could use some words of encouragement. 
In Iraq, Syria and Libya, ISIS terrorist groups are retreating, thanks to comprehensive efforts by local, regional and international actors. 
And regarding Syria, I of course hope the ceasefire that has been agreed between the regime in Damascus and the opposition groups will hold, and that efforts will be successful to begin political talks on finding a peaceful solution. 
However, the coming days and weeks will prove whether or not the ceasefire can be successfully sustained. 
If we have learned one thing from the failed ceasefires of recent months, then it is that, for true prospects for peace, more will be required than merely halting military confrontation. 
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, is working to this end and has our support. 
In Iraq, at least, we still have substantial concerns about the country’s future in the wake of a bloody civil war that has lasted many years. 
Israel’s right to exist, and the security of its citizens, are fundamental principles of our foreign policy. 
Most people I speak with in Israel also tell me that, in the long run, the only solution to the Middle East conflict is a two-state solution that must be negotiated by the parties. 
At the same time, the Palestinian side must of course also do its part and take tangible action against violence and acts of terror. 
We thoroughly scrutinised our work, taking a close look at practically every aspect of the foreign service. 
This brings very real benefits, such as in Iraq, where we, also with the help of new approaches, are able to ensure that stability returns to areas that have been liberated from ISIS. 
Through simple and immediate action – such as by repairing electricity grids and water lines – we have helped to create conditions in people’s home towns in which they can live their lives again and join efforts to rebuild. 
Unfortunately, the end of a Foreign Minister’s year cannot be compared to that of the Bundesliga, where during the winter break you can look back at last season’s results, draw conclusions and proudly add up your points. 
I am certainly very pleased about several developments we have set in motion in recent years. 
In Colombia we have also been able to help a little. 
We have kept the EU together after the earthquake caused by Brexit, making sure it didn’t cause even greater damage. 
And then there’s the crisis in Ukraine... 
The fact that we have also succeeded in launching a new disarmament initiative with the support of numerous OSCE countries is an important contrast to troubling current tendencies to build up armament stockpiles in the East and the West. 
It is a true honour to have received this nomination, and I am greatly pleased by the strong support I have been getting from all parts of society. 
Cautious hope for the people in Syria 
According to reports, the ceasefire throughout Syria is largely being observed. 
Real political negotiations necessary 
However, the German Foreign Minister went on to say that the coming days and weeks would prove whether or not the ceasefire could be successfully sustained. 
Involvement of all relevant actors important 
Steinmeier stressed that the ceasefire could only hold if other regional actors such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar were involved. 
Humanitarian access remains a priority 
The German Foreign Minister explained that it was now important for the parties to the conflict to “ensure humanitarian access to all besieged areas without delay and ... stop obstructing the aid workers. This is more urgent than ever now, during the winter!” For people in Aleppo and other besieged and embattled areas he said it was a matter of survival. 
Steinmeier stressed that German humanitarian assistance was ready to be deployed. 
Since 2012, Germany has provided more than 2.6 billion euros in support for the Syrian crisis, over half of which has been for humanitarian aid. 
Germany also recently set aside another 55 million euros for eastern Aleppo in order to provide the civilian population fleeing the city with basic necessities. 
Alongside food, tents and medical supplies, the priority now is to provide blankets, stoves and warm clothing for the winter. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier talks to the Rheinische Post newspaper 
Focus on Syria 
Topics: developments in Syria, Israeli settlement policy, review of Germany’s foreign policy, Germany’s G20 presidency and Ukraine. 
After six years of brutal civil war, the people in Syria deserve prospects for a peaceful future of their country. 
Our humanitarian assistance is ready to be deployed. For people in Aleppo and in other besieged and embattled areas, this is about sheer survival. 
Your review programme has initiated a dialogue on new approaches to foreign policy, that is, creative diplomacy beyond mere “talking” or “shooting”. 
In this way, we will be showing that we refuse to withdraw into our nation-states, battening down the hatches in defence. Instead, we want to promote international cooperation, dialogue and openness. 
Also, after having held the OSCE Presidency for one year, we can be content that we have re-established this organisation, which is so very important in these times of crisis, as a forum for East-West diplomacy. 
The fact that a Federal President must be internationally-minded is a responsibility of his office and nothing new. Yet the importance of this aspect might increase in times of international crises and conflicts. 
“If we have learned one thing from the failed ceasefires of recent months, then it is that, for true prospects for peace, more will be required than merely halting military confrontation,” Steinmeier declared. 
“Without meaningful political negotiations that involve all relevant actors, efforts to permanently end the fighting will not succeed.” 
He emphasised last Saturday (31 December) that at the same time, setting political negotiations in motion as soon as possible on the basis of UN Resolution 2254, which outlines the framework for a peaceful solution, remained a priority. 
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura has already announced steps to achieve this goal and has consequently welcomed the new ceasefire. 
“The fact that this ceasefire is more or less holding raises cautious hope for the people in Syria,” Foreign Minister Frank‑Walter Steinmeier said in an interview with the Rheinische Post (2 January).

Various thematic and regional budget items are available at the Federal Foreign Office for the project funding referred to above. 
You can download a sample budget here:

Federal Office of Administration: 
We have summarised the most important information for applicants here: 
Information sheet for Federal Foreign Office project funding: 
What is the legal basis for decisions on the allocation of funds? 
Who is eligible to receive funding? 
These regulations are, where necessary and in harmony with the general principles of German budget law, also used mutatis mutandis when awarding grants to recipients based outside Germany. 
Germany’s foreign policy seeks to take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalisation. 
Nobody is simply entitled to be awarded a grant. 
Do I have a right to funding? 
The Federal Foreign Office retains political control and overall responsibility, however. 
The Federal Foreign Office decides on submitted applications according to due assessment of the circumstances involved, on the basis of the availability of budget funds, in accordance with funding concepts or funding information with the Administrative Regulations pertaining to paragraph 44 of the German Federal Budget Code (BHO), the General Auxiliary Provisions on Grants for the Promotion of Projects (ANBest-P) and the Special Auxiliary Provisions of the Federal Foreign Office on the Award of Grants (BNBest-AA) currently in force. 
Since 2001, the Federal Foreign Office has, via the ifa zivik project, supported individual measures by German and international NGOs in the areas of crisis prevention, peacekeeping and conflict resolution. ifa zivik receives Federal Foreign Office project funding to support German and international NGO measures. 
However, the decision as to whether a project receives funding is entirely up to the Federal Foreign Office. 
This means that approved funds can only be paid on the day on which they are required (i.e. the day on which payments are due). 
Information about withdrawing approved funding: 
In its strategy paper on cooperating with new international players, the German Government outlines how it intends to manage globalisation. 
How is project progress monitored? 
Progress monitoring is regularly carried out during implementation and after the project is completed, using the indicators to be defined by the applicant in consultation with the Federal Foreign Office when applying for funding. 
At the same time, it is necessary to master the challenges and minimise the risks. 
“Shaping globalisation, expanding partnerships, sharing responsibility” 
In February 2012, the German Government approved a strategy paper entitled “Shaping globalisation – expanding partnerships – sharing responsibility”, 
which provides the basis for even closer cooperation with these countries on issues arising from globalisation. 
“Shaping globalisation – expanding partnerships – sharing responsibility” (PDF | 1 MB) 
New regional strategies for Latin America and Africa emphasise the dynamic development of these regions. 
Organisations that are exclusively based abroad must submit their applications to the German Embassy responsible for their respective country. 
In which regions can projects be supported? 
What other cost ceilings apply? 
What project costs are eligible for funding? 
All expenditures necessary in the context of cost-effective and economical budgetary management for projects and measures aimed at achieving the approved grant purpose are eligible for support. 
In addition, only costs for project staff (i.e. staff employed solely for the project concerned) can be covered. 
What kinds of funding are there? 
- Fixed-sum financing: 
- Full financing: 
With this in mind, funding is currently focused on projects and measures in Africa and the Middle East. 
What is the political basis for funding? 
The German Bundestag plenary decision of 15 March 2001 (printed paper no. 14/3862) states that: 
Civilian crisis prevention, civilian conflict management and post-conflict peacebuilding offer a prospect of success in particular if they have a subsidiary, multilateral and multidimensional structure, if different 
governmental, economic and social players and, above all, mediating forces from the conflict regions pull together. 
To increase effectiveness and efficiency, activities and programmes have to be discussed and coordinated at national, regional and international level.” The federal budget has funds available annually to fulfil this ongoing mandate. 
Projects that have already commenced are not eligible to receive funding. 
- Deficit financing: 
We also call for the release and rehabilitation of the activists and members of the opposition who were taken into custody. 
We therefore call upon all political actors to consistently and transparently implement the agreement, fully respecting its terms and the national constitution. 
Article on the Immigration Act (Zuwanderungsgesetz) 
Subsequent immigration of family members and children 
As regards the subsequent immigration of children, the upper age limit of 16 years has fundamentally been retained. 
“On 31 December 2016, representatives of the government and the opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed an agreement that points the way to free and fair elections in 2017. 
Federal Foreign Office statement on agreement between the government and the opposition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
The Catholic Bishops Conference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserves our profound gratitude, for it facilitated the talks and thereby significantly contributed to the agreement that has now been reached. 
Children aged under 16 years are entitled to be granted the necessary residence permit. 
We call upon all those involved to uphold human rights, to investigate and get to the bottom of violations that have occurred in recent weeks and months, and to hold to account those who were responsible. 
Young persons aged between 16 and 18 years are granted a residence permit if they move their main place of residence to the federal territory with their parents or the parent who has sole custody of them, speak German or have good integration prospects. 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (2 January 2017) at the governmental press conference: 
It is a good thing that this agreement was finally reached, and that it is obviously being accepted by the political stakeholders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
This means the country now has the prospect of, and a roadmap for, truly democratic transition. 
Together with our European partners, we will observe the transition process, and we stand ready to support the elections, which will hopefully be held before the end of this year.” 
In cases of joint custody, a residence permit for subsequent immigration to join one of the parents with custody can be granted in certain circumstances if the other parent gives his or her consent to the child’s residence in the federal territory or if there is a legally binding decision by a competent body on this. 
Energy efficiency, renewable energies and phasing out nuclear energy are the essential pillars of Germany’s energy policy. 
Built by a German consortium, the solar power plant Andasol 3 in Spain is currently the largest solar installation in Europe. 
All German nuclear power plants are to be shut down by 2022. 
Germany is therefore making a substantial contribution to climate and resource protection. By becoming less dependent upon imports of fossil fuels, it is also helping to increase the security of supply. 
The Federal Foreign Office and the German missions abroad are supporting this exchange of experiences and the international energy policy dialogue. 
On behalf of the Federal Government, they are working on the international stage to achieve a more sustainable energy policy around the world, for instance within the European Union or in the United Nations. 
The energy transition can only be successful when it is successfully embedded in a European framework. This is the only way to bring together climate protection, security of supply and competitiveness. 
Important focuses in this context include the EU’s 2030 climate and energy framework, which, among other things, seeks to reduce greenhouse gases and to increase energy efficiency.

The energy transition around the world 
With the energy transition, or Energiewende in German, Germany intends to make its energy supply more sustainable, environmentally friendly and reliable. 
The energy transition as a pioneering project 
With its experience of the energy transition, Germany is a respected dialogue partner in international energy policy. 
Other countries also stand to benefit from Germany’s successes and strategies, and also from its changes of course, in their energy policies. 
Efforts to reform emissions trading are another project. Moreover, the EU intends to grow together as an energy union in accordance with a framework strategy submitted in 2015. 
The aim is to reduce energy consumption by 50 per cent compared with 2008 and for 80 per cent of the country’s energy needs to be met from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower by the year 2050. 
The Federal Foreign Office devised the travelling exhibition on Germany’s energy transition in order to give those interested around the world an impression of what the energy transition is all about, what it means to the Germans and what its essential elements are. 
The Federal Foreign Office can already inform you at this stage as to whether the project is likely to be considered for funding. 
Please take the opportunity to first submit a project outline (up to a maximum of three pages in length) when first getting in contact. 
Should your project be taken into consideration for funding, you may submit a formal application signed by two people who are authorised to represent the applicant organisation. 
This application must arrive at the Federal Foreign Office at least eight weeks before the scheduled project start date. 
Who should I send the formal application to? 
Cooperation at European level 
The Federal Office of Administration will be happy to answer any questions you may have about this and about job gradings for your staff. 
Please select one of the following funding areas: 
Please refer to the support received from the Federal Government in a suitably public manner. 
Outsourcing of processing steps to the Federal Office of Administration: 
ifa zivik programme: 
Projects and measures run by German or international NGOs are supported that are able to prove that they already have substantial experience in the area of tangible project work, preferably in fragile contexts. 
A focus of project funding, however, is on countries and regions affected by conflicts or crises that the Federal Foreign Office is helping to stabilise in cooperation with international partners. 
How and when can I apply for funding? 
Please structure this outline using the question words who, what, how, why, where, etc. to give us a quick overview of your project. 
Please send applications for funding under 400,000 euros from Federal Foreign Office budget funds, and which do not apply to Afghanistan and Pakistan and democracy-building aid, to:

As a rule, support is available for implementing projects anywhere in the world, although generally not in EU member states and countries that belong to the European Economic Area. 
You may, as a rule, apply for funding from the Federal Foreign Office at any time. 
Please note that, as a rule, each lump sum must be presented in a transparent manner. 
Please send your project outline including logframe and financial plan, by email only, to xxx@diplo.de. 
Can lump sum amounts be applied for? 
The Federal Foreign Office prefers a direct statement of expenses to be made, however. 
Which budget funds are drawn on for grants? 
The Federal Foreign Office decides on submitted applications with consideration to the availability of budget funds and in accordance with the Administrative Regulations pertaining to the Federal Budget Code (BHO), the General Auxiliary Provisions on Grants for the Promotion of Projects (ANBest-P) and the Special Auxiliary Provisions of the Federal Foreign Office on the Award of Grants (BNBest-AA) currently in force. 
Should you wish to apply for funding in excess of 400,000 euros from Federal Foreign Office budget funds, please send the completed and signed application together with a financial plan in Germany – or via the mission abroad responsible for your region – to: 
Afghanistan; measures in the area of crisis prevention, peacekeeping and conflict management worldwide; transformation partnerships (especially North Africa/the Middle East), democracy-building aid worldwide and the Africa initiative. 
The main aim is to avoid cash shortages on the part of the grant recipient that might put project implementation at risk. 
The withdrawal procedure, which must be observed to the letter, allows for a six-week period in which funds can be paid out after they have been requested. 
As part of the division of labour within the Federal administration, the administrative formalities surrounding the project and the final evaluation will be undertaken in part by the Federal Office of Administration in Cologne. 
The institute’s zivik programme oversees the entire project cycle (application, disbursements, auditing of proof of employment of funds, etc.). 
The Federal Foreign Office supports projects and measures by German and international NGOs that seek to manage current conflicts, prevent potential conflicts and stabilise the situation following a conflict. 
Contributions by civil society to international peace efforts and peacekeeping missions by international organisations, such as the UN and its regional organisations or specialised agencies, are also eligible to receive support. 
Please also note the respective information regarding support. 
Alongside its extensive cooperation with international organisations and foreign state authorities, the Federal Foreign cooperates with a broad spectrum of NGOs. 
Regardless of the funding volume, this is also the right address for projects relating to Afghanistan, Pakistan and democracy-building aid. 
- Partial funding (generally only for grants based on costs): 
the costs for which a grant can be awarded are calculated according to a fixed percentage or share. 
a fixed sum is provided to meet costs for which a grant can be awarded. 
if the grant recipient has no resources of its own with which to implement the project and cannot receive any funding from third parties, but the project and the purposes for which it is being implemented are quite clearly in the public interest, then the Federal Foreign Office may in exceptional cases consider funding all expenditure recognised as eligible for a grant. 
In order to simplify administrative procedures, you can in exceptional cases combine expenses for administrative purposes as lump sums.

“the many people who have been so badly injured a full and rapid recovery”. Federal President Gauck and Federal Chancellor Merkel also condemned the attack and expressed their condolences to President Erdogan. 
With respect to the question as to whether there were any German victims, a Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson said on Monday (2 January) that it must be assumed that Germans were also among the victims. 
The Spokesperson also stated that three German nationals had been injured in the attack. 
He added that they were receiving excellent medical treatment and were no longer in a critical condition. 
but also an attack on a particular way of life, “one that we also share”. This was also apparent from the victims’ wide range of different nationalities. 
“We believe that two of those who were killed came from Germany, i.e. they were permanent residents here.” He said that the Federal Government was cooperating very closely and intensively with the responsible Turkish authorities. 
Travellers and German nationals in Turkey are encouraged to consult this advice on a regular basis, either on the Federal Foreign Office website. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier shocked about the attack in Izmir 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement this evening (5 January) on the attack in Izmir: 
The Central Agency for Schools Abroad (ZfA) 
I am deeply saddened by the news from Izmir and shocked that Turkey has after just a few days again been the target of such an attack. 
The Turkish security forces obviously managed to avert something even worse. 
In the fight against terrorism, Germany stands at Turkey's side no matter whether the motivation behind such attacks is Islamist, ethnic or ideological. 
We mourn with the families of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are with the injured. 
providing schooling for German children abroad, 
promoting the German language, 
strengthening Germany as a location for business and tertiary education. 
A total of 50 specialist ZfA advisors are available around the world. 
Central Agency for Schools Abroad 
Young people around the world learn about modern Germany and modern German society, and their interest in all things German is awakened and fed at the schools in this network. These include German schools abroad, at which pupils can obtain widely recognised qualifications in line with international standards, such as the Abitur, the German International Abitur and the International Baccalaureate, as well as schools preparing pupils for the German Language Certificate. 
Through its work, the ZfA helps achieve the goals of cultural relations and education policy in more than 98 countries. These goals include: 
The ZfA finds some 2000 teachers in Germany and places them abroad, providing them with advice on teaching-related and administrative matters during their placements. 
At the request of the individual host countries, these experts lend their assistance to schools in the national education systems that run an extended German programme. 
Germany’s foreign policy budget 
The ZfA and the PASCH initiative 
The federal budget for 2017 came into force on 1 January. 
At 5.2 billion euros, the Federal Foreign Office accounts for around one and a half percent of the federal budget. 
Political priorities 
The biggest items in this section of the budget are humanitarian aid to the tune of 1.2 billion euros (on account of the great need in and around Syria); crisis prevention at 316 million euros; the Stability Pact for Afghanistan at 180 million euros; and disarmament at 30 million euros. 
Initiatives in Africa are to be stepped up including migration partnership projects above all with Niger and Mali and work to promote the Lake Chad region. 
Continuing to promote education, research and language 
Through the Schools: Partners for the Future (PASCH) initiative, the ZfA supports the establishment of new schools on the German model, expands all-day schooling at the German schools abroad and finds additional teaching staff. 
These priorities are reflected in the budget for 2017, and 923 million euros have therefore been earmarked for the Federal Foreign Office’s cultural relations and education policy. 
Some 37.6 million euros will go to support the work of the German Archaeological Institute in 2017. 
Personnel and administrative costs 
The ZfA has been busy since PASCH was launched in February 2008: 
The Federal budget on the Internet 
Many schools have introduced all-day provision or have expanded existing programmes. 
Various open and closed models have been chosen to meet parental wishes and local circumstances. 
The general principle is that all-day provision must meet local needs and be underpinned by an educational concept. 
enabling it to assist the DSD schools even more efficiently. 
These ZfA educational experts are based abroad and so are well placed to intensify cooperation with local schools that teach German as a foreign language and to advise on the provision of more German classes. 
They thereby strengthen the competitive position of the schools on the international educational market.

Prior to the visit, a team of assessors reviews the submitted documents and school data. 
Cabo Verde 
The agreements which all have a similar content and structure apply to planned stays in the Schengen area of up to 90 days in any half-year (short stays). 
They apply to nationals of these countries all around the world. 
Quality assurance by means of BLI school inspections 
You can access the agreements using the links on the right. 
The BLI, which is organised by the ZfA, determines the quality of a school by means of a site visit lasting several days. 
The inspections centre on class visits to observe as many teachers as possible. 
The BLI draws its information primarily from guided interviews with all groups involved in the school, as well as a physical inspection of the premises. 
The school is then expected to draw up a plan of action based on the outcome of the report. 
The ZfA will advise the schools on measures to improve performance. 
This annual report is published and serves as a strategic tool providing key findings for the further development of the German schools abroad in general. 
If a school does well in an inspection, it is entitled to call itself an “Excellent German School Abroad”, and is presented with a certificate signed by the President of Germany to this effect. 
Inspections are repeated every six years in order to maintain quality.

The Central Agency for Schools Abroad (ZfA) has the task of promoting the quality-oriented development of schools abroad and to support the establishment of new schools on the German model. 
The PASCH initiative has made it possible for the ZfA to employ additional advisers and coordinators, 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier on Ursula Müller’s appointment as Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator 
These facilitators systematically assist the German schools abroad in their strategic development as part of educational quality management. 
To qualify as inspectors, Länder and ZfA experts with experience of schools abroad attend a special training course. 
The United Nations can count on Germany’s full support. 
The schools are thus given the chance to further improve their standards. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement today (6 January) on Ursula Müller’s appointment as Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator (UN-OCHA): 
I am delighted by the decision taken by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and would like to congratulate Ursula Müller on her new office in New York. 
The BLI highlights how any given school can make the most of its potential. 
I also believe that this appointment acknowledges Germany’s great commitment in the area of international humanitarian aid. 
The results of the inspections at all schools flow into an annual overall report, which does not however permit any conclusions to be drawn about the state of individual schools. 
the number of German schools abroad has grown from 117 to 140 and the network of German Language Certificate (DSD) schools has expanded from 440 to approximately 1100. 
16 quality development facilitators work for the ZfA at various locations around the globe. 
Learning without borders - Conference of German Schools Abroad in Berlin 
More than 130 school principals are meeting from today (4 January) in Berlin. 
Their schools ensure that children all over the world can be taught in German. 
Their schools do not just ensure that children all over the world can be taught in German. In fact, 
from Chile to Indonesia, German and local children can together complete their university entrance qualification, the Abitur - an encounter that stays with them for life.

From Asunción to Shanghai, 
"Guten Morgen" is chorused at eight o'clock in the morning not just in classrooms in Germany but also in German schools abroad all around the world. 
Those attending a German school abroad are learning in a special place. 
After all, the curriculum of the more than 140 schools abroad does not just feature maths, English and German. 
The schools abroad are places for children of different cultures to meet and engage in dialogue. 
After all, it is usually not just the children of Germans living abroad who learn there but also of course local children, as well 
over the world, the German education system has an excellent reputation. 
Most German schools abroad are international schools. 
Lessons are given both in German and in the local language. 
German and local pupils thus get to know two languages and cultures at an early age. 
They can conclude their schooling with the German Abitur, the university entrance qualification thus opening the door to German universities and the German labour market. 
Creating places where people can meet 
Deutsche Schule Madrid Foreign Minister Steinmeier at the German school in Madrid © photothek.net 
Around two-thirds of pupils at German schools abroad come from the host countries. 
Many go on to attend German universities after they complete their Abitur and retain links to Germany in their future careers. 
This leads to networks on which foreign policy, exports and culture can be based. 
To exploit that potential to an even better extent, the German Government, via the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), has since 2001 offered full scholarships to study in Germany to the best non-German school-leavers. 
That is why German schools abroad are a key component in our cultural relations and education policy. 
Accountable to the Federal Foreign Office, the Central Agency for Schools Abroad advises German schools abroad. 
The Federal Foreign Office has set itself the important goals of creating places where pupils can come face to face with the society and culture of the host country, ensuring schooling for German children abroad and promoting German as a foreign language around the world. 
Global network 
German schools abroad form a network spanning the world. 
More than 80,000 pupils in 70 countries attend German schools. 
The Federal Federal Foreign Office also promotes more than 1000 schools which offer intensive German lessons and the German Language Certificate of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
This means a further 300,000 pupils are benefiting every year. 
The principals and teachers working in schools abroad face particular challenges. 
How does inclusion work in Sweden? 
How do we best protect the school building in Erbil? 
How do we best encourage Japanese school graduates to study in Germany? 
The annual meeting of principals is very important for the network of German schools abroad 
as it provides an opportunity to discuss key developments in education and develop new strategies.

The European Union has concluded visa facilitation agreements with these countries (followed by date of signature/date of entry into force): 
Visa liberalisation for nationals of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia 
On 19 December 2009, visa requirements for nationals from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia were lifted for stays in the Schengen area of up to 90 days in any half-year, insofar as they are holders of a biometric passport (c.f. Annex II, Part I of the EU Visa Regulation). 
Visa requirements were also lifted for nationals of Albania as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina for stays in the Schengen area of up to 90 days in any half-year with effect from 15 December 2010. 
This also only applies to holders of biometric passports. Nationals not in possession of a biometric passport still require a visa in which case the aforementioned visa facilitation agreements apply. 
Nationals of Kosovo remain subject to visa requirements even if they have a Serbian passport. 
Key points of the agreements 
The main points are: 
simplification of the documentary evidence regarding the purpose of the journey (Article 4 applying for example to official delegations, business people, lorry drivers, journalists, pupils and students as well as close relatives) 
Increased issuance of multiple-entry visas to certain groups (applying to same groups as above) 
visa processing fee fundamentally set at 35 euro (Article 6) with various exemptions from visa fees (for example for family visits) 
processing time of 10 days after submission of application (Article 7) 
abolition of visa requirements for holders of diplomatic passports (Article 10 or 11)

Foreign Minister Steinmeier on the resumption of the Cyprus talks 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier made the following comments in Berlin this evening (8 January) on the resumption of the Cyprus negotiations in Geneva tomorrow: 
The negotiations on reunification are now on the final straight. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Steinmeier on the attack in Jerusalem: 
In 2017, Germany’s foreign policy will continue to focus on political challenges in the Middle East, Africa and Europe, which the Federal Government chiefly addresses via its humanitarian aid, crisis prevention and transformation partnership budget as well as through its cultural relations and education policy. 
The images posted remind us here of the terrible incident at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin just a few weeks ago. 
Cultural relations and education policy is not just something nice to have. 
That will not be easy. 
I condemn this vicious attack in the strongest possible terms. 
The role of cultural relations and education policy is exemplified once more in 2017 by the provision again of 14 million euros to expand cooperation with civil society in the Eastern Partnership countries and Russia. 
Terrorism is a threat to us all. 
Our thoughts are with the victims’ families and loved ones. 
Events in 2017 
The attackers seem to have had a clear aim: 
to inflame the tensions in the Middle East and to start a new spiral of violence. 
They must not be permitted to realise this goal. 
1.5% of the federal budget © picture‑alliance/dpa 
In the 2017 budgetary year, a total of 2.68 billion euros is available to be spent on safeguarding peace and stability (including contributions to the United Nations). 
A total of 12.5 million euros has been earmarked for the German-Czech Future Fund, as well as 48.5 million euros for the G20 Presidency. 
Work to attract UN organisations is to be intensified. 
It constitutes a vital pillar of Germany’s foreign policy. 
Important areas include German schools abroad, the Goethe-Institut’s work on language and culture, scholarship programmes run by intermediary organisations and a diverse range of academic relations worldwide. 
The German language plays a particularly important role as it is key to communication and mutual understanding as well as a basis for acquiring skilled workers which our country sorely needs. 
Expenditure on staffing and administration will stay fairly constant, 
with a total of 1.3 billion euros available in 2017 for the ministry and Germany’s 228 missions abroad. 
These costs thus account for only a quarter of the Federal Foreign Office budget. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Steinmeier to the German Bundestag during the budget debate 
Workshops, town hall meetings, and panel discussions: in 2017, the Federal Foreign Office will again be asking the question “What Kind of Europe Do We Want?” by hosting open civic debates all over Germany about the future of the European Union. 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Israeli friends at this difficult time. 
I wish all those who were injured a speedy recovery. 
60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome – what lies ahead for Europe? 
I hope that particularly now at this stage the two sides will not lose heart and will resolutely seek compromises to the last remaining contentious issues. 
However, the fact that the difficult security and guarantee issues are to be discussed now for the first time with the three guarantor powers Greece, Turkey and the UK is a good sign. 
In what ways must Europe change? 
We hope that the three guarantor powers are willing to play their part in finding a good solution and will help fulfil the will of the Cypriots, namely reunification. 
The series of events was launched at a conference at the Federal Foreign Office, during which Foreign Minister Steinmeier took questions from young adults.

If a breakthrough were to be achieved, it would be great news not only for people in Cyprus but for Europe as a whole and the entire region. 
However, the last round of negotiations in Mont Pélérin at Lake Geneva ended in November 2016, without a breakthrough. 
The series of events called “What Kind of Europe Do We Want?” is continuing in 2017, with numerous meetings and discussions all over Germany. 
Logo of “What Kind of Europe Do We Want?” 
On 25 March 1957, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed the Treaties of Rome, thereby establishing the European Economic Community, which later would become the European Union. 
Two events will be held only a few days later, on 19 January 2017, with Martin Kotthaus, Head of the European Directorate-General at the Federal Foreign Office, hosting a debate at Palais am Fürstenwall in Magdeburg and State Secretary Markus Ederer attending an event at Kongresszentrum Rosenheim. 
This year, the series is getting off to an early start: on 16 January 2017, Susanne Wasum-Rainer, Germany’s Ambassador to Italy, will meet with interested citizens in the Kurhaus of Wiesbaden. 
This year will mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the treaties. Yet, as the date of commemoration approaches, Europe appears to be weakened by crises and differences of opinion, an impression that was further reinforced by the Brexit vote. 
That is why the Federal Foreign Office initiated a series of open civic debates called “What Kind of Europe Do We Want?”. 
What are our expectations of the European Union? What role can and should Europe assume in tomorrow’s world?

Schools abroad - recent developments

The BLI, a system of inspections at German schools abroad which involves both the Federation and the Länder (federal states), was instituted in 2008 in order to assess teaching standards at the German schools abroad. 
The aim is not to assess the skills of the individual teachers, but to identify the teaching profile of the school as a whole. 
The school is given oral feedback immediately at the end of an inspection. A few weeks later it receives a written inspection report.

such as appendicitis. 
Premature babies would have no chance of survival. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (9 January) on the attack in the north of the Sinai Peninsula, which killed at least nine people, almost all of whom were police officers: 
“We categorically condemn the attack on a police checkpoint in the city of Al-Arish in the north of the Sinai Peninsula and the attempted attack on a further checkpoint. 
Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We wish all those who were injured a rapid and full recovery. 
The circumstances of and background to the incident are still unclear. 
However, there can be no doubt that 
A quarter of these funds goes directly to aid organisations such as the Order of Malta, three‑quarters go to multilateral partners such as the United Nations.

nothing can justify such terrorist acts. 
Terrorism is a threat that the international community faces together.

With this assistance Germany aims to help alleviate the most acute suffering in the Syria conflict. 
The Innovative Learning Excellence Initiative builds on these high-quality institutions and their wide-ranging efforts. 
The situation for the civilian population is worst in the besieged areas. 
German Schools Abroad and the Goethe-Institut have the potential to become cutting-edge learning institutions that can chart a path for the German education system to follow, so that Germany will remain a driver of global progress and innovation. 
Quality in education is determined by the following factors: 
The supply situation is particularly dramatic in the city of Deir ez‑Zor in north-eastern Syria. 
There, the fighting with “Islamic State” (IS) has left the population almost totally cut off from the outside world. 
The few items of food still available are extremely expensive. 
Ensuring that curricula are up to date and well-aligned with future requirements Centres of excellence for innovative learning are tackling cutting-edge issues. They are, with the help of digital media, devising effective scenarios that promote learning in the fields of technology, computer science, natural sciences and mathematics. By providing students with relevant knowledge, they want to spark their interest in pursuing MINT studies at university. Students are also introduced to entrepreneurial thinking and processes. 
For the airlift, food, medicines and other humanitarian supplies are tied firmly to wooden pallets. 
They are then dropped from a carrier some way out of the city like beads on a string, the white parachutes open and they float to the ground. 
Maintaining many methods of learning, as well as ensuring that these methods are tailored to the learning objectives and that they provide and optimally support individualised learning. Centres of excellence for innovative learning are equipped with suitable learning platorms and networks. 
On the ground, personnel from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), the equivalent to the Red Cross, are waiting to receive and distribute the supplies. 
Around 100,000 people in Deir ez‑Zor have registered for food rations with the SARC. 
Thanks to the airlift they have been able to receive basic essentials.

In 2017, the Federal Foreign Office will continue to use its humanitarian assistance to support numerous projects and aid operations. 
Expanding and opening up learning environments by using digital media in innovative ways, with a view to promoting creative, individualised and intercultural learning, and so as to prepare students for future working methods. At a minimum, curricula at centres of excellence keep up with current economic and social developments and provide students with the necessary media skills. 
What is more, future developments are anticipated, so that today’s students will be prepared to meet tomorrow’s requirements. 
Qualifying instructors to teach their respective subjects with a full range of didactic methods and media tools and devices, so that they can create excellent learning processes, and advise and accompany their students as they learn For students to receive individualised, digital-media-based instruction at centres of excellence that gives them the skills and knowledge they will need to navigate tomorrow’s world, teachers must be well qualified and receive thorough training in the digital media. 
It aims to implement truly innovative approaches at these important places of learning and to expand them into centres of excellence. 
At the moment, amputations often have to be performed despite the fact that the injured limbs could be saved with specialist intervention. 
For civilians returning to their villages and homes, these traps pose a major threat. 
According to Lietmeyer there are no longer any vascular surgeons in the whole of northern Syria. 
They have long fled from the war zones, but some are living in Turkey, still close to their homes. 
As the Bab al‑Salam field hospital is directly on the border, specialists could operate there during the day and return to Turkey in the evening. 
They would thus have a job suited to their skills with which they could provide for their families. 
At the same time, they would help many of their compatriots to avoid disability, which often leads to lifelong poverty and dependence. 
That means not only that operations on typical war injuries such as shrapnel wounds following a missile or bomb attack would not have been possible, but also that many people, especially children, would have died from non‑life‑threatening diseases which nonetheless require operative intervention, 
After initial problems, since April 2016 the WFP has managed to drop 2958 tons of aid supplies in the starving region over the course of the year. 
The WFP estimates that it has enabled 20,000 families to receive assistance. 
The Bab al‑Salam field hospital, for example, is to receive an urgently needed vascular surgery department. 
The number of injured people has increased dramatically in recent weeks, as, in the territory liberated from IS, the terror militia has left behind a large number of booby‑traps and landmines.

Faris is one of between 70 and 80 babies born each month in Bab al‑Salam, which means “Gate to Peace”. 
“In October alone, 66 emergency Caesareans were performed”, Janine Lietmeyer, Middle East Coordinator for Malteser International, explained. 
According to Lietmeyer “without Germany’s support, this hospital would not exist. 
300,000 people would not have received care.” 
In future, vascular surgeons will also operate at the Bab al‑Salam field hospital so that amputations can be prevented as far as possible Malteser 
Average life expectancy in Syria has fallen by 20 years, one reason for this being the catastrophic healthcare situation. 
Bab al‑Salam is one of almost 70 humanitarian aid projects financed by the Federal Foreign Office for Syrian refugees in the country itself and in neighbouring states. 
In the past four years, Germany has provided 1.25 billion euros for humanitarian assistance and is one of the leading donor states in providing assistance for people in need in the conflict zones. 
Of the 13.5 million people in need of assistance in Syria, almost six million live in areas where it is difficult or impossible for humanitarian aid to get through. 
In 2016, Germany therefore provided ten million euros to support the airlift organised by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). 
The symbolic bridge formed across the Mediterranean region and the close ties between Europe and Africa will send a clear message for the further development of global migration goals. 
The Federal Government has appointed Götz Schmidt‑Bremme as Germany’s ambassador for the GFMD co‑chairmanship 2017–2018. 
The GFMD is an initiative of the members of the United Nations which focuses on examining the relationship between legal migration and development from a practical and action‑oriented perspective. 
It is an informal, non‑binding, voluntary, government‑led process at global level within a transnational framework. 
The GFMD process combines the expertise of all regions and countries at all levels of economic, social and political development. 
The goals of the GFMD are: 
Statement by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on the death of Roman Herzog: 
I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Roman Herzog. 
to provide an informal framework in which political decision‑makers can discuss relevant legislation as well as the practical challenges and opportunities of migration and development and consult with other stakeholders, including non‑governmental organisations, experts and migrant organisations to elaborate action‑oriented results at national, bilateral and international level; 
to exchange experiences and best practice which could be replicated or adapted in other situations to make the most of the development advantages of migration and migration flows;

Just like countless other law students before and after me, I learned about German constitutional law from his commentary on the Basic Law. 
We have lost a great constitutional law expert, politician and statesman today. 
Roman Herzog served our country in offices of great importance and in many different ways over several decades. 
Roman Herzog’s long political journey took him from the Rhineland-Palatinate to Baden-Württemberg and then to Berlin where he became the first elected Federal President in reunited Germany. 
As President of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog was always a trustworthy proponent of fundamental rights, the rule of law and humanity. 
To me, Roman Herzog was an upright, honest and intelligent man who did not shy away from spelling out hard truths but never lost his refined sense of humour. 
My deepest sympathy goes out to Roman Herzog’s family and loved ones.

Together, these three states comprise the GFMD Troika. 
The GFMD Friends of the Forum are open to all United Nations member states and observers. 
GFMD cooperation with other international organisations and interest groups 
The United Nations and other international organisations, above all the International Organization for Migration (IOM), as well as academic, private sector and civil society organisations, are involved in the process to the extent that this is appropriate and desired by governments. 
The close relationship between the GFMD and the United Nations is fostered by the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General for International Migration and Development and the Global Migration Group. 
As an employer, the private sector is an important government partner within the GFMD framework. 
Governments, enterprises and civil society share a common interest in achieving a transparent and humane migration policy which does justice both to the needs of the labour market and to the international recognised rights of employees.

The GFMD Steering Group consists of governments which actively work to provide long‑term political and conceptual support for the Forum process and the current chair and guarantees process continuity. 
They ensure that all United Nations member states and observers are informed of developments in the Forum and discuss the agenda, structure and form of the separate Government Meeting sessions. 
The GFMD Government Meeting reports are submitted to the United Nations via the Secretary‑General. 
A common space during the GFMD Government Meeting provides a platform for open dialogue between governments and civil society. 
Bodies 
OSCE crisis management in Ukraine 
Crisis and conflict management in the OSCE area will remain a priority in 2017. 
The OSCE has a crucial role to play in the settlement of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. 
As a member of the OSCE Troika (along with Austria and Italy), Germany has political responsibility for the work of important OSCE instruments, 
in particular for the work of the Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group, the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), the Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk (OM) and the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine (PCU). 
Germany is also assisting the OSCE’s efforts in Ukraine by providing financial contributions and personnel. 
There is a focus on seconding staff to the SMM. 
OSCE activities in Ukraine 
Until 2014, the OSCE’s chief representation in Ukraine had been a project office. 
In 2014, in the course of the spiralling conflict in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the OSCE emerged as the most important multilateral player working to calm the conflict and resolve it politically. 
Trilateral Contact Group: 
The OSCE’s key forum is the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) established in June 2014, in which representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE consult one another and negotiate concrete steps towards implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
The TCG is headed by Ambassador Martin Sajdik of Austria, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine. 
In the TCG framework, four working groups meet regularly in Minsk to discuss politics, security, economic issues and humanitarian affairs. 
Ongoing political backing for the TCG has from the start been provided by the governments of the Normandy Format – Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine. 
In March 2014, the OSCE Permanent Council deployed a civilian Special Monitoring Mission initially comprising up to 500 monitors. 
The maximum size was raised to 1000 monitors in March 2015. 
There are currently around 700 monitors from more than 40 OSCE participating States taking part in the SMM. 
The SMM is represented by its head office in Kyiv and monitoring teams in Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv and Chernivtsi (western Ukraine) as well as Kherson, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk and Odessa (south-eastern Ukraine). 
The presence of the SMM is intended to reduce tensions, and its daily reports are meant to contribute to transparency and consequently stabilisation. 
The fundamental prerequisite for completing these tasks is that all those involved in the conflict need to cooperate with the SMM in order to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of the observers. 
More information on the SMM is available on the OSCE website: 
A mission comprising 20 civilians has been observing traffic at the checkpoints on the Russian-Ukrainian border at Gukovo and Donetsk since July 2014. 
The OM operates on the territory of the Russian Federation. 
The OSCE institutions have conducted other activities at Ukraine’s invitation since the crisis began. 
These include a mission to assess the human rights situation in spring 2014 and election observation missions for the presidential elections in May 2014, the parliamentary elections in October of the same year and the local elections in October and November 2015. 
Germany has seconded 40 experts to the SMM and OM and funds around 12% of the annual SMM budget. 
Germany seconds experts to the SMM via the Center for International Peace Operations (ZIF). 
In addition to that, Germany is supporting the projects run by the ODIHR and the OSCE PCU to foster national dialogue, to implement reforms, for example in combating corruption or the restructuring of the police and justice system, as well as mine and ordnance clearance. 
All our sympathy goes out to the victims and to their families and friends. 
Together with the international community, Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with Afghanistan on this path.” 
Nothing can justify the Taliban’s violence against the Afghan people. 
The Afghan people long for peace and stability.

Reform of the United Nations Security Council 
Bild Meeting 
Session of the UN Security Council © picture alliance/dpa 
Something finally needs to be done about reforming the United Nations Security Council! 
If it is not adapted to the geopolitical realities of the 21st century, that is, if it does not ensure in particular adequate representation of the global South and major contributors to the UN system, the Security Council's legitimacy and authority are at risk. 
The debate on Security Council reform started in earnest in the early 90s following the end of the Cold War. 
Since February 2009 the negotiations on Security Council reform have been conducted in an informal plenary of the UN General Assembly (IGN - Intergovernmental Negotiations). 
An overwhelming majority of UN members favours a reform that would enlarge both categories of Security Council membership (permanent and non‑permanent). 
But there is no consensus as yet on specifics. 
The Civil Society Days held around the time of the Government Meeting have proved their worth as a place to discuss contributions from civil society and formulate recommendations and action plans for governments.

Survival in the midst of war: 
Germany’s humanitarian assistance in Syria 
Our partners describe their work on the ground. 
Countless moving individual stories lie behind the statistics. 
Draft Decision adopted on 14 September 2015. 
Although the document is very long, it could provide an initial starting‑point for negotiations on a concrete text. 
particularly since our international partners and the German public constantly urge us to bring our influence to bear there. 
As the fourth-largest contributor, largest provider of development aid and also major player in many areas of the UN’s work (e.g. human rights, climate, disarmament), it is only natural that Germany should aspire to a permanent seat on the Security Council, 
We can only do so if Germany is a member of this body. 
Therefore, together with its G4 partners, Germany continues to actively advocate a reform of the UN Security Council. 
More than seventy years after the founding of the United Nations and ten years on from the last important reform summit, it is high time for concrete steps to be taken. 
The United Nations Security Council 
The President of the General Assembly appointed the ambassadors of Romania and Tunisia to the United Nations as co-chairs of the Intergovernmental Negotiations of the 71st General Assembly. 
On 21 September 2016, the foreign ministers of the G4 partners (Germany, Brazil, India and Japan) met on the fringes of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
They reiterated their resolve to continue to work together to reform the United Nations Security Council. 
The same day, high-ranking representatives of all regional groups met and formed a new Group of Friends on Security Council Reform with the aim of injecting new momentum into the process. 
The Preamble to the German Basic Law defines the task of German foreign policy: 
“to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united Europe”. 
German foreign policy is therefore a policy for peace. 
This principle is a central part of all the activities of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Specific examples include Germany’s engagement in the United Nations and the OSCE, in the areas of global disarmament and crisis prevention. 
Germany’s place in the UN General Assembly photothek.net 
The 2017 Government Meeting will take place in Berlin at ministerial level from 28 to 30 June. 
The work of the GFMD in 2017 will contribute to the United Nations Global Compact on Migration, which is intended to send a strong signal from the international community for an enhanced global migration policy and is to be adopted by the community of states in 2018. 
The GFMD was established in 2007 at the instigation of Belgium as a result of the high‑level UN dialogue on international migration in 2006. 
Germany is widely involved in the UN and is now the fourth-largest contributor and a potential candidate for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. 
The Federal Foreign Office has financed almost 70 humanitarian assistance projects for Syrian refugees in the country itself and in neighbouring states. 
A report on the daily reality of the humanitarian aid workers. 
Germany is taking a comprehensive approach to advancing the cause of peace and security worldwide. 
In a world in which great distances can be travelled in a matter of hours, Germany’s neighbourhood has expanded. 
It is also for this reason that Germany is involved in United Nations peace missions around the globe, contributing policemen and women in Haiti and military forces in Mali, to name but two examples. 
The country’s priorities included issues such as children and armed conflicts and climate change and security. 
Germany is currently once again applying for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2019/20. 
Moreover, Germany is pushing for UN reform, especially of the UN Security Council, in order for the organisation to embody a more realistic reflection of today’s global balance of power and therefore work even more effectively to promote peace and security.

Many severe crises are posing major challenges for German foreign policy. 
The question of how to employ effective prevention measures to avoid crises and conflicts erupting in the first place is therefore becoming increasingly significant. 
Post-conflict peacebuilding is an important aspect of crisis prevention, since it prevents the renewed outbreak of violent conflicts. 
The Federal Foreign Office cooperates with specialist partner organisations in the area of crisis prevention. 
The main focuses of this engagement are:

Small arms control in Afghanistan picture alliance/dpa 
Germany campaigns actively for disarmament, arms control and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it supports the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. 
Within the framework of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), Germany is seeking along with nine other states to reduce nuclear risks, for example by means of negotiations on a ban regarding production of fissile material for weapons purposes. 
In many countries of the world, Germany promotes projects to control small arms and to implement the ban on landmines and cluster munitions with the aim of seeing it universally applied.

North Atlantic Alliance 
The North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) remains a central pillar of German security and defence policy. 
Its three core tasks are: 
Collective defence: mutual support in the event of an attack from outside 
Crisis management: 
operations to prevent and stabilise crises 
Cooperative security: 
cooperation with non-NATO states to promote international stability

The OSCE is also a key component of German peace policy. 
It was formed against the backdrop of the Cold War to promote security and trust in three dimensions: the politico-military, the economic and environmental and the human dimension. 
The OSCE still plays an important role for peace in Europe even now that the Cold War is over. 
Its significance has increased once again as a result of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the OSCE is active in many ways, including with a monitoring mission. 
Germany is represented in almost all OSCE long-term missions and institutions and is the second-largest contributor after the United States. 
It has been a member of the OSCE Troika since January 2015 and assumed the chairmanship of the organisation on 1 January 2016.

Federal Foreign Office condemns attack in Kandahar 
Our thoughts are with those who were killed and injured, and with their families and friends. 
There is no possible justification for violence against people who, as diplomats or development workers, are in the country to work for a better future for the Afghan people. 
“We condemn the attack on the Governor of the Afghan province of Kandahar in the clearest and strongest possible terms. 
Our sympathies are also with the diplomats from the United Arab Emirates who were among the victims. 
Germany’s work as a bridge-builder was universally recognised: 
On 14 September 2015, despite resistance from the opponents of reform, a first “framework document” outlining all positions on reform was unanimously adopted for consideration by the 70th session of the General Assembly (69/560): 
In 2005 an agreement that appeared almost within grasp came to nothing. 
Since then there has been stalemate.

Draft resolution by the S5 (PDF, 33 KB) 
The United Nations (UN) was founded following the Second World War to promote and safeguard peace throughout the world. 
In 2011 and 2012, Germany played an active role in the work of the Security Council as a non-permanent member. 
From 2013 to 2015, Germany was a member of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and also provided the Council Chair in the person of Ambassador Rücker. 
Germany also supports the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), of the High Commissioner on National Minorities and of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media in Ukraine. 
More information on this is available on the ZIF website: 
The German Government furthermore supplies the SMM with intelligence from satellite imagery analysis and offers weapons-recognition, equipment as well as additional equipment aid for the observers and for the mission’s technical capabilities. 
Lasting crisis prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflict peacebuilding can only succeed if women and men play an equal role in them. 
No conflict can be permanently resolved if half the population is excluded from peace processes. 
I particularly welcome the wide-ranging programmes and measures to include women, especially those aimed at protecting women and girls in armed conflicts. 
The Action Plan was drawn up by the ministries in the Interministerial Working Group (the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, the Federal Ministry of Defence, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development) 
and also includes ideas and suggestions from civil-society organisations. 
It reports on women’s participation at the national and international level and on the Federal Government’s political endeavours in the national, regional and international context. 
An informal Security Council working group is addressing the implementation and further development of the resolution.

Federal Government 2017–2020 Action Plan to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security (PDF, 603 KB) 
The large number of crises and violent conflicts worldwide, some of which are in Europe’s immediate neighbourhood, pose great challenges to us. 
Parties to conflicts continue to violate international humanitarian law, including through the use of sexualised and gender-based violence. 
Through the measures and projects contained in the new Action Plan, the Federal Government will continue working to foster the greater involvement of women in crisis prevention, conflict management and post-conflict peacebuilding and the protection of women and girls against violence in armed conflicts. 
The definition of the women, peace and security agenda as a cross-cutting issue of Germany’s foreign, security and development policy remains the fundamental approach of the Action Plan. As such, this field will be further enhanced and defined more strategically.

In response to a request from the Government of Mali, France decided in favour of military intervention in early 2013. 
The support for the northern Iraqi Peshmerga fighters is to be extended. 
Although the Islamist militias were driven away, the threat to state order posed by terrorist groups remains. 
This decision was taken by the Federal Government on Wednesday (11 January) at the instigation of Foreign Minister Frank‑Walter Steinmeier and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen. 
Multi‑faceted German engagement 
Germany was involved in the mission from the outset – both financially as the fourth-largest contributor and with personnel on the ground. 
The primary task of the German soldiers is to shed light on the activities of Islamist terrorist groups and on other factors hindering the implementation of the peace agreement.

Since April 2014, military training assistance as part of the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy has been flanked by the civilian training mission EUCAP Sahel Mali. 
Since the start of the multinational programme, approximately 12,000 soldiers have already received training in northern Iraq and Germany, including members of national minorities.

Since international efforts began, it has been possible overall to halt the advance of the terrorist organisation. 
IS has been driven back to a few core areas. 
Partners in northern Iraq still need support

Through the extension of the mandate, the Bundeswehr is therefore to continue its involvement in training the Peshmerga. 
German forces will continue to be deployed in the Kurdistan‑Iraq region. 
In the context of this mission, up to 150 German soldiers are currently helping to train the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against the IS terror militia. 
The United Nations MINUSMA peacekeeping mission 
In 2012, Islamist groups managed to gain control of large parts of northern Mali and make some advances into the south of the country. 
This is why the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) was established in 2013 with a view to stabilising peace. 
Members of the Iraqi armed forces have also been trained in Germany. 
EUTM, EUCAP Sahel Mali, and development cooperation 
Although military support for the Peshmerga in their fight against IS is having an impact, the conflict is not yet over. 
At the end of August 2014, the German Government responded to a request from the Iraqi side and Kurdish-Iraqi forces and gave its approval for support for the Peshmerga fighters. 
Germany is providing support within the framework of the international alliance against terror, which comprises more than 60 states. 
Alongside civilian experts, Germany is currently providing the Head of Mission, Ambassador Albrecht Conze. 
In addition to these missions, Germany is engaged in humanitarian assistance and development cooperation. The aim is to sustainably improve conditions for people in Mali, as well as for the many refugees. 
These efforts include strengthening civil society, promoting the national reconciliation process, decentralisation and agriculture, as well as improving the water supply situation. 
The OECD Codes of Liberalisation, whose aim is the transparent and non-discriminatory treatment of investors, regardless of their nationality, is of special importance here. 
The Guidelines are voluntary and thus not legally binding. 
The Committee on Financial Markets (CMF) is the platform for all OECD work relating to financial markets. 
Its stated aim is to help establish open, efficient and stable financial systems through greater understanding of financial market issues and active policy guidance. 
To this end, current and structural developments on the financial markets are monitored and analysed, while reform measures are developed and evaluated. 
Statement by Minister of State Böhmer on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security 
The Cabinet agreed today (11 January) on the Federal Government’s 2017‑2020 Action Plan to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security. 
It also approved the Federal Government’s report on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 for the 2013‑2016 period. 
Minister of State Böhmer issued the following statement on this today (11 January): 
All perpetrators of such violence must be held to account. 
The 2017‑2020 Action Plan builds on the comprehensive approach of the first Action Plan, which covered the 2013‑2016 period. 
The implementation report describes the Federal Government’s activities and measures to implement UNSCR 1325 between 2013 and 2016. 
In addition, it reports on political and project measures in line with the six priority areas of the first Action Plan and lists the some 200 projects carried out during the reporting period (2013‑2016). 
The aim of UNSCR 1325, which was adopted in the year 2000, and of follow-up resolutions 1820, 1888, 1889, 1960, 2106, 2122 and 2242, is to include women to a greater extent in crisis prevention, conflict management and post-conflict peacebuilding and to protect them against violence in armed conflicts. 
In the OECD Competition Committee, the different aspects of international competition are analysed and exchanges among national competition authorities strengthened. 
On the basis of this exchange, the Competition Committee adopts best practices, for example on the exchange of information. 
In future, the activities of the Corporate Governance Committee will focus more on the implementation of the adapted principles as well as on monitoring such implementation. 
Beyond the daily challenges of crisis diplomacy, we must also focus on the deeper causes of violent conflicts. 
The aim is to initiate a joint learning process through comparisons and reviews from different member states. 
The work of GOV is discussed with the member states in three committees: 
Public Governance Committee (PGC): 
– Budget policy and management 
– Public employment and human resources management 
– Ethics and integrity in the public sector (fight against corruption) 
– Open governance responsive to citizens 
– Government reform 
– Administrative simplification 
– Regulatory impact assessment 
– Regional economic promotion, social development and environment policy 
– Regional planning 
– Traffic management 
The EU-financed SIGMA programme (Support for Improvement for Governance and Management) as well as the OECD MENA Initiative are special projects of the GOV Directorate. 
Under this proposal, up to 150 German soldiers are to continue to train Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi armed forces. 
The work of the Investment Committee focuses on identifying the positive impact of international investment through political analyses and consultations as well as developing international standards. 
These are joint recommendations drawn up by the 35 OECD member states for responsible business conduct in line with applicable law for foreign investment. They are also supported by non-members (including Argentina and Brazil). 
These goals are intended to be met by monitoring the markets, collating statistics, analysing policies and conducting a political dialogue, as well as formulating concrete political recommendations (e.g. in the form of good practices, guidelines and principles). 
The Bundeswehr’s training support in northern Iraq in cooperation with international partners is an important contribution to the fight against IS. 
Germany’s engagement in training support, in coordination with international partners, plays a significant role in these efforts. 
increasing its contribution within the framework of MINUSMA 
Germany plans to step up its engagement within the framework of the MINUSMA peacekeeping mission, with deployment, not earlier than March 2017, of combat and transport helicopters and up to 350 additional soldiers. 
Deployment of up to 1000 German soldiers 
According to the cabinet decision, Germany will step up its engagement: from March 2017 at the earliest, it will provide four combat and four transport helicopters for operations in Mali. 
Up to 350 additional service members will be deployed as helicopter maintenance and operations personnel. 
This will bring to 1000 the number of German military personnel in the UN mission. The total force strength of the mission is 15,000 (military personnel and police officers). 
In addition to participating in MINUSMA, Germany is also working on other levels to stabilise Mali, for example as part of the EU Training Mission in Mali, which serves to strengthen the Malian armed forces in the long term. 
Its focus is to provide training and advice to the police force, the Garde Nationale and the Gendarmerie, also on the rule of law and the respect of human rights.

German stabilisation work in Colombia 
Website of the German-Colombian Peace Institute / Instituto CAPAZ 
Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier travelled to the South American country on Thursday evening (12 January) to further Germany’s support for the peace process. 
Lending a helping hand – Steinmeier visits Colombia to support the peace process 
During his visit, he will also visit a disarmament zone in the Colombian jungle and open the German-Colombian Peace Institute. 
The decades-long war between the government and left-wing guerillas claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. 
The conflict has thus left deep scars on society and made the peace process a very difficult undertaking. 
Following lengthy negotiations, a breakthrough was achieved in September 2016 and an agreement was signed. But then came a bitter setback – 
Working resolutely for peace 
In the meantime, the new agreement has been signed and is now at the implementation stage. 
But after such a long conflict, disarming the fighters, integrating them into the country’s political institutions and restoring state control quickly in all formerly contested areas is anything but easy. 
Coming to terms with the past is an important and major challenge. 
The peace agreement explicitly requests support from Germany in the field of reconciliation and transitional justice. 
Germany has been providing humanitarian assistance in Colombia for many years. It lent support to the peace process by appointing Tom Koenigs as Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process. 
Work on the foundation of the German-Colombian Peace Institute, which will conduct research on the consolidation of peace and provide stakeholders with guidance on policy, has been ongoing since October 2016. 
“Peace takes courage” is the motto of the opening event of the peace institute, which Foreign Minister Steinmeier will attend during his visit to Bogotá. 
On Thursday (12 January), Foreign Minister Steinmeier met his Egyptian counterpart Shoukry in Berlin. 
The current weeks and months are of historic importance for Colombia and much further beyond. 
Local weather conditions permitting, Foreign Minister Steinmeier will travel to the conflict area to visit one of the 26 special zones where thousands of FARC fighters are currently said to be gathering to lay down their arms. This will enable the Foreign Minister to see the implementation of the peace agreement at first hand. 
On Thursday (12 January), Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. 
Talks at the right time

Bild Minister bei Pressekonf. …. 
Steinmeier said that the situation in Syria remained “terrible”. 
A political settlement was still a long way off. 
In the hard winter months, people needed humanitarian care all the more urgently. 
Their talks focused on German-Egyptian relations and the areas of conflict in the Middle East. 
Apart from bilateral relations, the talks focused on the areas of conflict in the region.

Their talks focused on German-Egyptian relations and the areas of conflict in the region. 
“We had long and intensive talks,” Steinmeier said after his meeting with Shoukry. 
The meeting had taken place at the right time. 
Difficult bilateral topics also on the agenda 
With regard to bilateral relations, the agenda also included difficult topics. 
Steinmeier said the talks had also dealt with the need to combat terrorism, including which means can be allowed in this context. 
They also addressed the question of German political foundations being able to start working in Egypt again. 
After the talks, Foreign Minister Steinmeier expressed hope that a solution could soon be found in order to enable the political foundations to restart their work. 
“There is great upheaval in the region, and a significant amount of order has been lost,” Steinmeier said. 
The various areas of conflict posed risks and threats to the entire region, not least to Egypt. 
Steinmeier paid tribute to efforts made by Egypt, which has recently played an active role in attempts to bring about a political settlement. 
Egypt plays an important role in the Middle East conflict 
With regard to the Middle East conflict, Steinmeier said it was essential to “work resolutely to preserve the chance of peace in the region”. 
Egypt had a key role in the peace process and carried particular weight in the Arab world, Steinmeier said. 
Furthermore, the two ministers had talked about the importance of fundamental freedoms and human rights. 
The talks had thus also focused on the situation in Libya, Egypt’s neighbouring country to the west. 
Although fighting had become less intense in parts of the country, the international aid organisations were still experiencing difficulties in providing the urgently needed humanitarian assistance. 
He underlined once again that this chance of peace can only exist in the form of a two-state solution – if security is ensured for Israelis and Palestinians, and two states can live peacefully side by side as neighbours. 
Training for International Diplomats 
With each other, for each other, all around the world - Training for International Diplomats is a success story. 
These are optimum conditions for a diplomatic network for the future.

Foreign Minister Steinmeier at the Middle East peace conference in Paris: 
Speaking on the fringes of the Middle East peace conference in Paris, Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement today (15 January): 
Over the past few years we have undertaken huge efforts to reach lasting peace between Israel and Palestine. 
Information about project funding from the Federal Foreign Office, Division S03 (PDF, 307 KB) 
Many of these efforts have failed, but the conference in Paris comes at exactly the right time nevertheless. 
I am grateful to my French colleague, Jean-Marc Ayrault, for hosting this Middle East peace conference. 
2017 will be a decisive year for the Middle East peace process. 
If I read the signs correctly, there are some thoughts of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem. 
That must be avoided, and this conference can at least contribute to that by giving all those interested in lasting peace in the Middle East another chance to say that the two-state solution is the only way to create peaceful conditions and to ensure that an Israeli and a Palestinian state can live side by side in the region in peace. 
Destroying Syria’s chemical weapons – Germany’s involvement as part of the international community 
Bild US vessel ... Specially equipped US vessel Cape Ray in Bremen Federal Ministry of Defence/Milenkovic 
The civil war in Syria entered another level when, in contravention of international law, chemical weapons (sarin) were used against Syrian civilians in summer 2013. 
Following the threat of military steps from the United States and an agreement between the United States and Russia on the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, the Syrian regime declared itself ready to destroy its chemical weapons and acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on 14 September 2013. 
Following decisions reached by the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the chemical weapons declared by Syria were removed from Syria by sea by June 2014 to be destroyed outside Syria.

Subsequently Syria’s chemical weapons were destroyed in international waters in the eastern Mediterranean on board the specially equipped US vessel Cape Ray. 
This involved using hydrolysis to neutralise the chemical agents. 
Several countries, including Germany, were involved in the final destruction of the remnants produced by hydrolysis. 
In early September 2014 Germany thus received approximately 370 tonnes of remnants from the Cape Ray, which are comparable with conventional industrial waste, in Bremen, and took them to Munster (Lower Saxony), 
where the publicly owned disposal company GEKA incinerated the final remnants in an environmentally safe process on 30 April 2015. 
As both hydrolysis and the incineration of the remnants (hydrolysate) took place in closed systems, no dangerous substances were released into the air or the sea during these processes. 
Both the United States and the GEKA have considerable experience with these tried and tested technologies. 
Use of chlorine gas and mustard gas in Syria 
In several reports in 2014 and 2015, an OPCW commission of inquiry established that a toxic chemical, very probably chlorine gas, had repeatedly and systematically been used as a weapon in Syria. 
In response to this, both the OPCW and the United Nations Security Council condemned the use of chlorine gas. 
In 2016, an investigation mechanism established by the United Nations (OPCW‑UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)) concluded that the Syrian army was responsible for the use of toxic chemicals (probably chlorine gas) in three out of nine meticulously investigated cases (in 2014 and 2015). 
2017 is a decisive year for the Middle East peace process 
If such thoughts in themselves are enough to make the Palestinian side threaten measures and responses, then one can sense right at the start of the year that we may possibly be facing the risk of renewed escalation. 
For that to happen there can be no room for anything which endangers this process for the future. 
That is why a Security Council resolution points out that acts of violence do not make it easier to return to the negotiating table, and nor of course do settlement activities. 
And so I hope that with the large number of states represented here today – almost 70 – we will arrive at a common viewpoint and a joint declaration. 
I hope that the French initiative, for which I am very grateful, will once again get the international community behind the two-state solution. 
In response to this, the OPCW condemned these chemical weapons attacks in the strongest possible terms and called upon those responsible for the use of chemical weapons to be held accountable. 
Chlorine gas is a basic chemical which is used in numerous civil applications (e.g. for drinking water disinfection) and is freely available. 
For this reason, chlorine gas, as opposed to sarin or mustard gas, for example, is not included on the CWC’s lists of prohibited chemicals. 
However, the chemical weapons ban includes the use of all toxic chemicals, regardless of whether or not they appear on the CWC lists. 
The deployment of chlorine gas as a toxic weapon therefore constitutes a clear violation of the CWC and is consequently being investigated by the OPCW. 
Further German involvement in the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria 
Germany has paid five million euros into the OPCW’s Syria Trust Fund for the Destruction of Chemical Weapons. 
Furthermore, German laboratories were involved in the testing of chemical weapon samples from Syria. 
The destruction of the chemical weapons is a crucial factor for the security of the international community. 
Germany is acting in its role as a key member of the EU, the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 
Chronology 
Deployment of chemical weapons in several Damascus suburbs, claiming approximately 1500 lives and injuring many other people. 
The United States and Russia reach an agreement on the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons. 
Syria accedes to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). 
The UN Security Council (Resolution 2118) and the OPCW Executive Council unanimously condemn the use of chemical weapons as contravening international law and agree to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014. 
In addition, the UN Member States are authorised to participate in the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. 
Syria’s accession to the CWC formally enters into force. 
The OPCW Executive Council agrees on a plan to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons outside the country. 
The handover of the chemical weapons declared by Syria to a Danish and a Norwegian container ship in the port of Latakia and their removal to international waters is completed. 
Some of the chemical weapons are taken directly to the United Kingdom and the United States for destruction. 
The remaining Syrian chemical weapons are neutralised by hydrolysis on the high seas in the eastern Mediterranean on board the specially equipped US vessel Cape Ray and the remnants then taken to Finland and Germany. 
370 tonnes of remnants from the Cape Ray are unloaded in Bremen and taken to GEKA mbH in Munster (Lower Saxony), supervised by the OPCW. 
Destruction of the remnants in an environmentally sound manner by GEKA mbH is completed. 
The OPCW reports that the destruction of all chemical weapons declared by Syria has been completed with the elimination of 75 hydrogen fluoride cylinders at a facility in Texas.

Furthermore, a mustard gas attack (in 2015) was attributed to the so‑called IS. 
No mechanism to verify compliance 
The BWC does not include a verification regime to ensure compliance with the Convention. 
Although Article VI does state that any State Party which suspects any other State Party to be acting in breach of obligations deriving from the provisions of the Convention may lodge a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, which may in turn carry out an investigation, this instrument has not yet been used. 
These consist of an exchange of information: states should report annually on relevant biological activities, on civilian research and production facilities as well as on national biodefence programmes. 
However, only some 40 percent of the States Parties participate in the CBMs each year. 
Germany is one of the few countries which permit their annual returns to be published on the website of the BWC Implementation Support Unit (ISU). 
Furthermore, Germany is campaigning with Switzerland and Norway for CBM returns to be more readily comprehensible and translated into all UN languages so that they can be evaluated more easily. 
As yet, however, no formal decision has been taken on this. 
Review Conferences to strengthen the BWC 
However, the States Parties did hold a Meeting of Experts and a Meeting of States Parties each year until 2005 to discuss and introduce effective measures (intersessional process). 
The seventh Review Conference in December 2011 approved continuation of the intersessional process from 2012 to 2015, with one Meeting of Experts and one Meeting of States Parties each year. 
The renewal of the Implementation Support Unit mandate for a further five years can also be considered a success. 
In addition, the possibilities for involving developing countries were strengthened. 
Germany participates in the programmes by inviting experts from non-contracting States. 
Other key standards are set out in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
In addition, specialist Working Parties on Public Debt Management and Financial Statistics convene under the auspices of the Committee on Financial Markets. 
The OECD work within the scope of the Insurance and Private Pensions Committee (IPPC) as well as its subordinate Working Party on Private Pensions serves to (1) improve understanding of questions relating to insurance and private pensions, (2) improve regulation in these spheres, (3) strengthen private pension systems with a view to dealing better with an ageing population and (4) improve the financial management of major risks. 
In the sphere of corporate governance, the OECD is the international standard setter thanks to its Principles of Corporate Governance, adopted in 1999 and revised in 2015. 
For instance, the Financial Stability Board has incorporated the OECD Principles into its list of 12 core standards to promote stable financial systems. 
They also form the basis of the corporate governance component of the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) by the IMF and World Bank. 
The Working Party on State Ownership and Privatisation Practices (WPSOPP), which belongs to the Corporate Governance Committee, addresses the improved governance of state-owned companies and the implementation of privatisation projects. 
The objective of the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State‑Owned Enterprises (SOE Guidelines), adopted in 2005 and amended in 2015, is to strengthen disclosure and transparency, thus guaranteeing competitive neutrality between state and private companies. 
The OECD Directorate for Public Governance and Territorial Development (GOV) deals with public sector tasks in the fields of budget policy, public employment as well as general regulatory policy. 
To this end, data for international comparisons are collated, specific analyses effected, international standards laid down and comparative studies on member states carried out.

The EU’s contribution to strengthening the BWC 
The European Union supports all multilateral instruments that aim to promote disarmament and non‑proliferation. This includes the BWC. 
The EU Strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which was adopted on 12 December 2003, set out three main principles for non‑proliferation of WMD: effective multilateralism, prevention and cooperation. 
To implement the Strategy, the EU is effectively taking all action identified in Chapter III, in particular with a view to strengthening, better implementing and universalising the BWC. 
As part of the Action Plan, the EU has on a regular basis held seminars on worldwide implementation of the BWC. 
This most recent engagement is based on the Common Position of the Council of 16 November 2015, which identifies four priorities with regard to participation by the EU: 
eeas.europa.eu 
The programme provides for sustainable projects in the field of biosecurity to be funded and implemented by German partner organisations and institutes in various different countries. 
The German Government is thus also fostering the international cooperation stipulated under Article X of the BWC. 
On 7 April 1983, Germany acceded to the BWC, which currently has 178 States Parties and six signatories. These include all members of the EU and NATO. 
At the 1986 and 1991 BWC Review Conferences, confidence‑building measures (CBMs) were agreed. 
Since an EU Joint Action was adopted on the issue in 2006, all EU member states have submitted annual CBM returns. 
German CBM return for 2015 
Application of the BWC is examined by Review Conferences every five years. 
At the 2001 Review Conference, the States Parties failed to agree on a legally binding supplementary protocol containing rules on verification to ensure compliance with the Convention. 
Since the decision was taken to conduct an intersessional process, the sixth BWC Review Conference took place in Geneva in December 2006. 
It ensured the continuation of the intersessional process until the seventh Review Conference in 2011, with annual Meetings of Experts and Meetings of States Parties that would examine, among other things, how to improve national implementation of the BWC as well as the issue of biological security. 
In addition, a permanent unit was set up in the Disarmament Department of the United Nations in Geneva (Implementation Support Unit, ISU) to provide the BWC with improved administrative support. This is mirrored by national contact points in the States Parties which are designed to coordinate BWC activities. 
The eighth Review Conference took place in November 2016 and was characterised by difficult negotiations and differences of opinion regarding implementation of the Convention. 
The minimal consensus eventually achieved was one Meeting of States Parties each year, the discontinuation of the Meeting of Experts (without replacement) and the extension of the ISU mandate for a further five years. 
The next Meeting of States Parties will take place in early December 2017 with a German vice‑chairman and will look at further substantive and procedural issues as well as the ISU annual report and progress on universalisation. 
Germany will continue to press for the strengthening of the Convention in the years leading to the ninth Review Conference in 2021. 
Germany’s priorities include improving national implementation of the Convention, strengthening confidence-building measures, and improving the operationalisation of the UN Secretary‑General’s Mechanism through concrete measures such as expert training sessions and workshops. 
On 20 March 2006, the Council adopted the Action Plan on biological and toxin weapons, which envisages more efficient use of existing instruments, such as the confidence‑building measures and the UN Secretary‑General’s investigative mechanism (UNSGM) in the event of suspected employment of chemical and biological weapons. 
The EU played a constructive part in the 2006, 2011 and 2016 Review Conferences.

In 2013, the Federal Government launched the German Partnership Program for Excellence in Biological and Health Security in the context of the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, set up in 2002. 
In this way, Germany is making an international contribution to improving implementation of the Convention (Article IV thereof) and to the non‑proliferation of biological weapons. 
On 16 January 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran had fulfilled its most important obligations under the Vienna agreement.

As a first step towards implementing the agreement, the United Nations (UN) Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2231 on 20 July 2015. 
On 16 January 2016, after Iran had carried out the agreed measures to discontinue its nuclear programme and these steps had been confirmed by the IAEA, the UN and the EU lifted the nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions it had imposed on the country. 
Since then, Iran has been able to export oil and gas again, and has been granted access to its frozen export revenue. 
In 2002, there were grounds for suspecting that Iran was carrying out a clandestine nuclear programme on a military scale and contravening conditions imposed by the IAEA. 
This granted IAEA inspectors extensive inspection and access rights. 
which took action, initially in the form of a presidential statement in March 2006, and subsequently by adopting six resolutions (July 2006, No. 1696; December 2006, No. 1737; March 2007, No. 1747; March 2008, No. 1803; September 2008, No. 1835; June 2010, No. 1929). 
These resolutions addressed the IAEA’s demands – particularly the calls to suspend enrichment, reprocessing and activities involving heavy water, and to implement the additional protocol – and made them binding under international law.

The E3/EU+3 talks underwent a fundamental change in 2013 following the election of President Rouhani. 
On 2 April 2015, the E3/EU+3 and Iran reached consensus in Lausanne on key parameters for a comprehensive agreement. 
Prior to that, the IAEA had agreed a roadmap with Iran on 11 July 2015 aimed at resolving all outstanding questions on Iran’s nuclear programme during the coming months.

Reports of the imminent execution of the young Iranian Sajad Sanjari prompted Federal Government Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler to issue the following statement today (16 January): 
I am extremely concerned about the imminent execution of the young Iranian Sajad Sanjari. 
Sajad Sanjari was only 15 years old at the time of the crime he is accused of having committed. 
There are serious doubts as to whether due process standards were complied with in the proceedings against him. 
Iran has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
both of which prohibit the execution of individuals who were minors at the time of the offence. 
Should Sajad Sanjari be executed, it would be an unacceptable violation of international law. 
I strongly urge the Iranian judicial authorities not to carry out the planned execution and to give Sajad Sanjari a fair trial and due process – without applying the death penalty. 
In November 2015, however, Sajad Sanjari was again sentenced to death. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (16 January) on the first anniversary of Implementation Day of the Vienna agreement on the nuclear programme of Iran: 
The verdict was upheld by Iran’s Supreme Court in August 2016. 
One year after Implementation Day, we note that Iran has complied, and remains in compliance, with the terms of the agreement. 
This is a significant contribution to greater security in a region that is beset by so many crises and conflicts. 
An appeal is still pending before that Court. 
Strong technical restrictions and comprehensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme is and remains exclusively peaceful. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement today (16 January) following the EU Foreign Affairs Council: 
This was a very special EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting for me in every possible way. 
Firstly, because it was the last that I was able to attend, 
It is important that the agreement be strictly implemented, since this a key prerequisite for building mutual confidence. 
We have every interest in working to ensure that the agreement’s provisions, which we believe are suitable and are having an effect, remain in force. 
Federal Foreign Office on first anniversary of Implementation Day of Vienna nuclear agreement 
For Foreign Minister Steinmeier it was a special meeting for another reason. 
We will remain dependable and predictable in our efforts to preserve these foundations. 
And we will – as High Representative Mogherini announced today – seek to enter into a dialogue with the future US Secretary of State as soon as possible. 
and also especially because the change of President in the US was a major topic in all of our discussions. 
However, the Foreign Ministers had very little time to get nostalgic. 
Transatlantic relations remain the bedrock of the Western world, and we must work to ensure that this foundation remains intact.

This goes for the World Trade Organization and for the alliances in which we are both partners, such as NATO. 
As the centrifugal forces within societies are gaining in strength, it is even more important for us to stand together as one. 
Moreover, we believe that the things that we have achieved through working with each other at different levels in the context of international law and European-American negotiations should apply. 
This is evident not only for foreign policy reasons, but also with a view to what is currently happening in Europe and in the member states of the EU.

Moreover, the German Government’s international cyber policy is designed to ensure that “German interests and ideas concerning cyber security are coordinated and pursued in international organisations, such as the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the OECD and NATO”. 
Germany’s international cyber policy is intended to shape this field. 
expand the economic opportunities the Internet offers, 
Our aim is to create an international environment that will enable Germany to make the most of the opportunities the digital world offers. 
We thus want to help ensure that the Internet evolves in a way that produces global win-win situations from which also the newly industrialised and developing countries stand to gain. 
We are actively seeking to protect human rights in the digital age. 
Within the United Nations, we were able to reach a consensus that human rights have to be protected “online” just as they are “offline”. 
At the same time, the scope and shape of certain obligations to protect human rights have to be carefully readjusted in line with new circumstances. 
Our ongoing commitment to the protection of privacy in the digital age as well as our visible participation in the Freedom Online Coalition has to be seen in this context. 
International cyber security policy 
The priorities for the work of the Federal Foreign Office in these fora are, among others, agreement on standards for good governance, the application of international law as well as the development of confidence-building measures for more cyber security. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s International Cyber Policy Coordination Staff, established in 2011, works with other ministries and actors to ensure a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace. 
The key, as we see it, is to work closely with our missions abroad to link national cyber policy with European and international efforts.

Statement by Foreign Minister Steinmeier following the EU Foreign Affairs Council 
After the interview that was published in a number of European newspapers today, this issue was particularly present in our minds. 
If you compare the positions of the President-elect and the future Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, then it is not yet possible to discern a common foreign policy line on the part of the new US Government. 
There have been a whole range of contradictory signals. 
We must now wait for a uniform concept to be drawn up in the near future. 
At the EU Foreign Affairs Council today, we discussed the shape that US foreign policy could take in the future. 
But above all, we established today that, from our perspective at any rate – from both the German and the European standpoint – our transatlantic relations must not under any circumstances be allowed to become any less important. 
This includes our common commitment to freedom, democracy and the rule of law – principles that we Europeans hold dear. 
With these various uncertainties in mind, perhaps some of us have been reminded once again today of how important it is for Europe to stay together and adopt common positions. 
The Federal Government also strives to promote the goals of Resolution 1325 in the European Union, NATO and the OSCE, as well as in other international organisations and forums.

“Transatlantic relations remain the foundation of the West and we have to work to ensure that this foundation remains intact – including our shared commitment to freedom, democracy and the rule of law – we Europeans stand by this”. 
A dialogue would therefore be sought as soon as possible with the future Secretary of State. 
Bringing momentum back to the Middle East negotiations 
To this end, the players involved must first of all return to the negotiating table.

The French initiative for the conference had therefore come at the right time, the Foreign Minister said. 
“All those involved know that the peace accord is one thing, but that the implementation process, which now follows, is just as important and will be just as difficult.” 
resuming negotiations 
A further conclusion reached was that the civil societies of both countries should be strengthened in order to improve the dialogue between both sides also at this level. 
They also called on the parties to the conflict to resume direct negotiations. 
Steinmeier thus cautioned: 
The tranquillity of the green rolling hills is deceptive: 
It was agreed that this could, for example, help to intensify the economic partnership with the EU. At the same time, Palestine would receive support for its efforts to build up institutional structures. 
“2017 is a decisive year for the peace process” 
The positive impacts that a peace agreement could have, especially in the area of political and economic cooperation, were also emphasised.

He memorably explained how he, a member of FARC, was now sharing a tent with the soldiers who had so recently been his enemies. 
Steinmeier spoke to government troops and UN observers before meeting with Commandante Kunta Kinte. 
Germany is supporting the peace process in the field of reconciliation and transitional justice, in demining, and by establishing a German-Colombian Peace Institute. 
“I hope, for all those involved, that this succeeds, and that, by implementing the peace agreement, the entire population of Colombia will see that it was in the end worth working for peace and that those who wish to return will find their place in Colombian society.” 
“A far greater challenge in a year in which the European Union celebrates its 60th anniversary is actually to ensure that this is an occasion worth celebrating. This means that we must show even more than was the case in recent months that, after the decision taken by the UK to leave the European Union, we want to work together to ensure that, among the remaining 27 member states, this Europe, this European Union, becomes a project of hope and a project of the future once again for the people in our European member states. 
The aim is to turn this chance of peace into reality.

Steinmeier: “risk of renewed escalation”

He added that there was a sense right at the start of this year that Israel and Palestine possibly faced the “risk of renewed escalation”. He said that the mere fact that the US had considered the possibility of moving its Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem had increased tensions between the parties to the conflict. 
Many of the efforts of the past years had failed and the Middle East peace process had stagnated since 2014, he continued. 
Nevertheless, he said, the conference had achieved at least one thing, which was for the international community to once again get behind the two-state solution and give expression to the fact that this solution is the only way to “create peaceful conditions and to ensure that an Israeli and a Palestinian state can live side by side in the region in peace”. 
Steinmeier emphasised that there could be no room for anything that endangered this process – neither acts of violence nor settlement activity would make it easier to return to the negotiating table. 
Renewed commitment to the two-state solution 
In a joint declaration, the countries in attendance called on the parties to the conflict to restate their commitment to the two-state solution and to resume direct negotiations.

The first meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers in the new year was both a première and a swan song. 
“This Council in Brussels is not only special for me because it’s probably the last time I will attend a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers”, Steinmeier said before the session commenced. 
In an interview, the President-elect called NATO “obsolete”. 
We’ll have to wait and see what this means for US policy”, said Steinmeier, who met NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg before the start of the EU Foreign Affairs Council. 
The comment by the President-elect that he would consider imposing protective and penalty tariffs also threw up many questions in the European Union. 
“We assume that our American partner will continue to comply with its obligations under international law and with WTO rules”, Steinmeier stated. 
He went on to say that following the consultations, the EU Foreign Ministers were agreed that: 
The EU Foreign Ministers also discussed other difficult global issues today. 
It became clear at the Middle East conference held in Paris at the weekend that a broad alliance of states agree that even if the road is a long one – momentum has to be brought back to the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. 
“We face unsettled times in the Middle East if we don’t manage to get the parties to the conflict to engage in direct negotiations with each other,” Steinmeier commented. 
Steinmeier stated that the tangible reduction in violence as a result of the ceasefire was to be welcomed. 
The EU Foreign Ministers had agreed, he went on to say, that the forthcoming talks in Astana brokered by Russia and Turkey could only be a stepping stone on the way to negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. 
The British Government has still to formalise its desire to leave. 
She stressed that Britain is seeking a positive and constructive partnership, indeed a friendship, with a strong EU. 
This is not something that we can take for granted, but rather we must work to achieve this. The most important task that we need to do here is to show the people that Europe is able to put forward solutions where they were not forthcoming or demonstrated in the past.” 
However, our stance is and will remain: 
the negotiations will not begin until Britain has officially informed the European Union of its desire to leave. 
It is in the interest of Germany and of Europe to strengthen the cohesion of the European Union of 27 member states and to maintain the unity of the European single market. 
Almost seven months have now passed since the referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. 
We therefore welcome the British Prime Minister’s speech today in which she outlined her Government’s ideas on the exit and finally created a bit more clarity about Britain’s plans. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier issued the following statement today (17 January) following the speech by Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May on how the British Government envisages the exit from the European Union: 
We, too, want relations that are as good and close as possible and based on mutual trust. We are hoping for constructive negotiations to this end. 
Tomorrow we will discuss in the Cabinet’s Brexit committee Germany’s position in the forthcoming negotiations. 
E3/EU+3 negotiations with Iran

The conflict surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme 
In signing the Vienna agreement of 14 July 2015, the E3/EU+3 countries and Iran reached consensus on a long-term settlement, following more than 12 years of contention over Iran’s nuclear programme. 
You will find important documents on the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme on the following websites: 
A year after the implementation phase started, significant progress has been made. The IAEA has confirmed in four reports that Iran is meeting its obligations. 
According to estimates, the country’s economy grew by 4.5 percent in 2016, while German exports to Iran rose by approximately 23 percent. 
Prior to this, on 14 July 2015, the E3+3 countries (China, Germany, France, Russia, the United Kingdom [UK] and the US), the EU and Iran had agreed on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme. 
In return, the sanctions imposed on Iran since 2006 will gradually be lifted. 
More than two-thirds of Iran’s centrifuges have been dismantled, the enriched uranium stockpile has been removed from the country and the core of the plutonium reactor in Arak has been destroyed. 
which is chaired by Helga Schmid, the German Secretary General of the European External Action Service and where they discuss the implementation and interpretation of the Vienna agreement. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier on the election of Antonio Tajani as President of the European Parliament 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement today (17 January) on the election of Antonio Tajani as President of the European Parliament: 
Through his experience with European policy as a long‑standing member of the European Parliament and EU Commissioner, Antonio Tajani has what it takes to lead the Parliament in difficult times. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier and his Dutch counterpart Bert Koenders opened the forum at the Press and Information Office of the Federal Government. 
The forum is part of a series of events titled “What Kind of Europe Do We Want?” 
I would also like to convey my great respect and thanks to Martin Schulz, whose mandate as President of the European Parliament ends today. 
The event has been held since 1996 and gives young people the opportunity to discuss current political and social issues. 
Workshops and discussions 
By so doing he has strengthened the “home of democracy in Europe” and set high standards which will have an impact far beyond his term of office. 
The tasks facing Europe will not grow any smaller in the coming years. 
The forum was opened by Foreign Minister Steinmeier and his Dutch counterpart Bert Koenders. 
Steinmeier: 
I congratulate Antonio Tajani on his election as President of the European Parliament today.

So far, the European Union has not managed to come up with a joint response to the refugee flows, Steinmeier said in his opening speech. 
Steinmeier and Koenders’ third meeting in one week

They discussed bilateral relations between Germany and the Netherlands, as well as international crises and conflicts. 
“Migration and integration”: 
The European Parliament is a crucial player in Europe in its role working to convince people of the value of our European project and when it comes to taking a stand against populists and extremists. 
In the past few years, Martin Schulz has, like no other, given the European Parliament a face and a voice, made it a force for debate and a heavyweight in the European arena. 
“Migration and integration” is the topic of this year’s German-Dutch Forum, which is being held in Berlin on 17 and 18 January. 
That applies to European and foreign policy, but it is also the case with regard to mounting anti-europeanism, populism and nationalism. 
German-Dutch Forum in Berlin

Whether it be Europe in the age of globalisation, voluntary euthanasia, demographic change, language, communication or identity, all these issues have been discussed at past German-Dutch Forums. 
It takes place alternately in Germany and the Netherlands and was jointly launched by then Foreign Ministers Klaus Kinkel and Pieter Kooijmans with a view to enhancing relations between Germany and the Netherlands. 
We need to relearn how to fight for Europe 
“We need to relearn how to fight for that Europe, if what has been achieved thanks to European integration in the past years and decades is to be preserved,” the Foreign Minister said. 
He went on to say that, at the same time, Europe must provide answers to the questions that people in the Member States are asking. Citizens want progress on refugee flows and migration, as well as on national and international security. Especially in the south, they want economic progress. 
It is therefore all the more important to promote discussions among the citizens of Europe through formats such as the German-Dutch Forum, and to include all generations in the debate. 
He said he was particularly pleased that 20 students from both countries are participating in the forum. 
Bild: Steinmeier und Alfano 
Before the opening event, Foreign Minister Steinmeier received his Dutch colleague at the Federal Foreign Office. It was their third meeting that same week, after the Middle East conference in Paris and the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. 
During this meeting, as well, Steinmeier addressed the future of the European Union. 
Also after the UK Brexit vote, the remaining 27 Member States must work harder than in recent months to build Europe’s future. 
Steinmeier insisted we must help the European Union once again become “a project of hope, a project that looks to the future”. 
However, the bilateral embargo by the US against Iran remains largely in force, 
The E3+3 countries and the EU are also adhering fully to their commitments – since 16 January 2016, all sanctions that they agreed to lift under the Vienna agreement have been suspended. 
Since then, Iran has had made tangible economic progress. 
The International Monetary Fund estimates economic growth of 4.5 percent in 2016. 
In terms of oil production, the country has almost reached pre-sanctions levels of some four million barrels per day. 
Between January and September 2016, the EU’s trade volume with Iran increased by 63 percent over 2015 to approximately 9.1 billion euros. 
Germany alone exported goods worth around two billion euros to Iran between January and October 2016, an increase of 23 percent over the same period in 2015. 
A large number of economic policy measures boosted this development. 
On 20 June 2016, Iran repaid its outstanding Hermes debts of approximately 575 million euros dating from the sanctions period. 
Following a 15-year suspension of its activities, the Joint German-Iranian Economic Commission held a meeting in Tehran on 3 October 2016. 
The meeting was chaired by the Economics Affairs Ministers and led to a large number of agreements on German investments in Iran. 
Over the course of 2016, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury updated its list of answers to frequently asked questions several times, most recently on 15 December 2016. 
The States Parties have an obligation to inform the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) of all their chemical weapons and production facilities and to destroy them under international supervision. 
The contract had only been signed a few weeks earlier, on 21 December 2016. 
Boeing also signed a contract with Iran Air in December 2016 on the delivery of 80 aircraft. 
The aircraft orders represent important milestones in the implementation of the Vienna nuclear agreement and help to ensure the safety of civil aviation. 
The international Procurement Channel is an entirely new instrument and has got off to a good start. 
The first applications have completed the Procurement Channel procedure and been approved by the Security Council. 
As part of the E3 with France and the UK, Germany endeavoured to resolve the dispute by diplomatic means from 2003.

Since then, trade in nuclear technology has been monitored via an international Procurement Channel. 
Germany and its international E3/EU+3 partners pursued a dual approach. 
It was stipulated that Iran would subject its nuclear programme to an extensive system of limitations and to far-reaching transparency measures for up to 25 years. 
As early as 24 November 2013, the E3/EU+3 and Iran agreed in Geneva on a first step towards resolving the nuclear dispute.

In addition, regular inspections in the chemicals industry relevant to the CWC are intended to consolidate trust and guarantee that its activities only serve purposes which the Convention does not prohibit. 
The OPCW promotes international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the chemical sphere, for instance through workshops. 
In 2016, Germany chaired the Conference of the States Parties. 
Germany’s Permanent Representation to the OPCW 
Destruction of chemical weapons 
Following the use of chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 near Damascus, Syria was required to disclose its chemical weapons programme and to destroy all of its chemical weapons. 
These decisions were preceded by an agreement between the United States and Russia of 14 September 2013 on the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, and on Syria’s own declaration on the same day that it would accede to the CWC. 
Because of the civil war in Syria, the declared chemical weapons were moved out of Syria and destroyed abroad. 
However, the OPCW has stated it doubts that Syria declared all of its weapons and all parts of its chemical weapons programme. 
There have also been recurring reports of chemical weapons use in Syria (especially chlorine gas). 
The OPCW is investigating these reports to determine whether chemical weapons were actually employed. 
In 2016 it declared that, in three cases, the Syrian armed forces had employed a toxic chemical (most likely chlorine gas). 
UN Security Council Resolution 2118 
Current OPCW information on Syria 
Fourth Report of the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism 
Statement by the United States dated 17 November 2016 on extension of the mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism 
Supervised by the OPCW, chemical weapons are continually being destroyed. 
As of October 2016, 94 percent of the category 1 weapons and 75 percent of the category 2 weapons that have been declared worldwide have been destroyed. 
Not all states which possess chemical weapons have destroyed their stockpiles within the allotted time frame. The US, Russia and Libya did not meet the deadline specified in the CWC (29 April 2012). 
The United States expects to have completely destroyed its stockpiles by 2023, and Russia expects to have done so by 2020. Libya will most likely be able to complete its chemical weapons destruction by 2017, with the assistance of Germany. 
Iraq, too, is working on destroying all of its remaining former chemical weapons stockpiles. Due to the difficult security situation, it is not clear when this process will be completed. 
The reason primarily given for the delays is that the environmentally sound destruction of stockpiles represents a great financial and technological burden. 
EU offers support through the CFSP 
One focus is on projects to help States Parties transpose their CWC obligations into national law. 
On 30 November 2015, the Council decided to provide five million US dollars in funding to support the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2235. 
Germany and the CWC 
Germany is helping eliminate chemical weapons that originate from other countries. 
Since August 2013, Germany has supported the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons by providing 5 million euros, training OPCW personnel and disposing of the chemical remnants of the weapons themselves. 
Germany played a role in building facilities in Libya to destroy the country’s chemical weapons. 
Since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has only ever possessed stockpiles of chemical weapons produced by the German Reich before 1945, which the CWC defines as “old chemical weapons”. 
Further “abandoned chemical weapons” are still periodically found in the ground at various locations, however. 
When they are, they are recorded by the Federal Armed Forces Verification Centre, reported to the OPCW and then destroyed at the GEKA in Munster. 
The chemicals industry in Germany, like those of the other States Parties, is regularly inspected by the OPCW. 
The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control collates the data on relevant chemicals provided by the German chemicals sector and prepares them for reporting to the OPCW. 
As the national authority for the CWC, the Federal Foreign Office is Germany’s contact to the OPCW and the other States Parties.

It is quite the opposite, he insisted. At the latest since the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, the EU appears to be divided. 
The focus of this year’s forum and workshops is “Destination Europe – are we witnessing a culture of welcome, or isolationism?” 
Bild, Umgang mit c-Waffen Handling chemical weapons is extremely dangerous. 
There has never been evidence of a member state violating the CWC by producing chemical weapons. A so-called challenge inspection can be conducted should such evidence emerge; this has never occurred in the past. 
It furthermore has an obligation to coordinate emergency measures to protect and help the victims of a chemical attack.

At the same time, the so-called Islamic State was identified as having used mustard gas in one case. 
Destruction of toxic chemicals from Libya’s former chemical weapons programme has been under way in Germany since September 2016. 
In 2015, Germany handed a mobile container lab and protective equipment over to Iraq, in support of the country’s efforts to destroy the remnants of it chemical weapons stockpiles. 
Only four members of the United Nations have not yet acceded to the CWC: 
The UN Security Council and the OPCW have established and support the activities of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, which aims to find those responsible for the employment of chemical weapons in Syria. 
The EU has supported the work of the OPCW with Joint Actions and Council Decisions as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). 
This resolution established a mechanism to identify the perpetrators who recently used chemical weapons in Syria. 
It thereby seeks to identify individuals, entities and groups who were involved in the use of chlorine gas and other toxic chemicals as weapons. 
Between 2002 and 2015, Germany helped Russia destroy many of its chemical weapons through considerable financial and technical support as part of the G8 Global Partnership initiative.

Minister of State Roth in Zagreb 
Prominent patrons 
This action was based on the decisions of the OPCW Executive Council (EC-M-33/DEC.1) and on UN Security Council Resolution 2118. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993 prohibits the development, production, possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons. 
The Convention furthermore restricts the production and use of certain chemicals, to prevent them being misused as components of chemical weapons. 
All the data that CWC States Parties need to declare are subject to systematic on-site verification. 
These inspections take the CWC beyond the simple prohibition and destruction of weapons of mass destruction. 
On 11 October 2013, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Since it entered into force on 29 April 1997, the CWC has proven to be one of our most successful disarmament treaties. 
With the accession of Myanmar and Angola in 2015, two more countries joined the convention. 
This brought the total number of member states to 192. 
The CWC’s entry into force in 1997 saw the establishment of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) based in The Hague. 
The OPCW monitors the States Parties’ implementation of and adherence to the CWC. 
One of its principal tasks is to conduct on-site inspections, systematically verifying declared chemical weapons and production facilities and ensuring they are destroyed. 
The OPCW acts through the annual Conference of the States Parties, its Executive Council (the 41-member permanent executive organ, of which Germany is a member) and its Technical Secretariat. 
Every five years, the States Parties convene for a special conference to review implementation of the CWC and decide on recommendations for the future direction of the OPCW’s work. The most recent was held in The Hague in April 2013. 
The OPCW Technical Secretariat has been headed by Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü of Turkey since July 2010. 
The EU also fosters cooperation on the use of chemicals for peaceful purposes and on protection from chemical weapons. 
They had all been destroyed by April 2007. 
In his speech, Roth said: 
Our joint promise to the younger generation should be to tell them that we are working hard so that they will enjoy a bright future. 
We are working to bring about greater growth, better education and good jobs. 
Young people are our best and most important asset.” 
“Our two countries enjoy good relations. 
We want to work even more closely together on EU matters. 
Europe is a diverse, multicultural and multi-faith community of shared values. 
That is why it is always particularly important to me to not only meet government officials when I travel. 
I met many convinced Europeans in Zagreb. 
In particular, my talks with Mufti Aziz Hasanović showed me how important interfaith dialogue is.” 
and met in private with Foreign Minister Davor Ivo Stier to discuss Croatia’s role in the EU enlargement process in the Western Balkans. 
During the presidential reception, Roth accepted an honour for the late Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
“Twenty-five years of independence are a good reason to celebrate. 
The award ceremony is to take place during the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue (BETD) in Berlin in March 2017, which will be attended by over 1000 delegates from 70 countries. 
He gave a speech to students of VERN University of Applied Sciences on the future of Europe and answered questions from them afterwards. 
The Minister of State summed up his visit as follows: 
In the same way that Genscher supported the independence of Croatia, the best way for us to honour him today is to convince young people to support the idea of a united Europe. 
Start-ups and the energy transition 
Start-ups will receive awards in the following six categories: 
A prominent platform for energy transition start-ups 
The Start Up Energy Transition Award:

Training for International Diplomats is an invitation to young foreign diplomats to gain professional experience in Germany at the start of their careers, to compare points of view and to identify common ground. 
The Training for International Diplomats programme was established in 1992 after the end of the Cold War, the aim being to promote the development of foreign services in the fledgling democracies with courses for diplomats from Central and Eastern Europe. 
These were followed inter alia by courses for Afghanistan, the Middle East, Latin America, Iraq, Africa, Asia, China, the Western Balkans, Belarus and Ukraine. 
Now more than 15 courses are on offer to some 180 countries. 
We have responded to the opening up of Myanmar with a programme for the country’s young diplomats in 2013. 
Each year, we welcome some 300 diplomats to Berlin from around the world. 
Yet we still cannot meet the demand. 
For each other 
Excursions to German cities such as Hamburg, Leipzig, Stuttgart, Munich, Frankfurt am Main and Bonn are another key component of the programmes. 
Practice-oriented elements of the programme such as negotiation techniques, rhetoric and media training enable the participants to acquire valuable skills for their professional career. 
The focus is on issues such as constitutional law, federalism, international politics in the 20th and 21st centuries, bilateral relations between the participants’ countries and Germany and the EU, as well as international economic policy, peacekeeping and human rights. 
The seminars are usually led by former ambassadors familiar with the region from which the participants come.

Ninety-five per cent of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile will be removed from the country or destroyed, and stocks will be strictly limited for 15 years. 
Representatives of the E3/EU+3 and Iran meet regularly every 90 days in the Joint Commission, 
It uses the strictest monitoring regime in the world and has confirmed that Iran is adhering to its undertakings. 
Since then, export credit guarantees (Hermes) have been available again for business with Iran. 
Before an exporting country can grant authorisation, it must secure approval from the United Nations Security Council. 
This is given when the country’s application has met the Procurement Channel requirements. 
The Joint Commission's Procurement Working Group reviews incoming export applications and makes recommendations on them to the Security Council. 
On the other hand, sanctions were imposed with the aim of persuading Iran to yield on the nuclear issue. 
There had been major doubts about the peaceful nature of this programme since 2002. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke of a “historic success for diplomacy”. 
On the basis of this confirmation, the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) lifted the economic and financial sanctions they had imposed on Iran over the course of the nuclear dispute. 
Vienna agreement 
The agreement includes technical restrictions and control mechanisms, which will ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme will serve exclusively peaceful purposes and cannot be used to develop nuclear weapons. 
The key elements of the agreement are as follows: 
- In the next 15 years, Iran will only enrich uranium in the Natanz facility and restrict this enrichment to 3.67 per cent. 
The country’s low-enriched uranium stockpile will be limited to 300 kilograms during this period. 
- Iran will convert the Arak heavy-water reactor so that it can no longer be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
- More than two-thirds of Iran’s centrifuges will be mothballed and placed under the supervision of the IAEA. 
- Everything that has been agreed will be fully monitored. 
Agreement was reached on a robust mechanism that guarantees the IAEA access wherever necessary. 
This will apply for up to 25 years, which goes significantly further than the IAEA’s general rules. 
In return for Iran’s implementation of the technical restrictions placed on its nuclear programme, the current sanctions against the country will be lifted in several stages. 
The UN’s “snap-back” mechanism is an important component of the agreement. 
This is an uncomplicated process through which UN sanctions that have been eased can be swiftly reimposed should the Government in Tehran breach the agreement. 
To this end, Resolution 2231 includes a simplified procedure that does not require a Security Council resolution should Iran fail to adhere to the agreement. 
The US relaxed its extraterritorial sanctions. 
The country can also use international financial channels. 
with the exception of food, carpets, aircraft and foreign subsidiaries of US companies. 
US measures imposed against Iran as a result of the country’s support for terrorism, human rights violations and money laundering, which also affect companies outside the US, also remain in force, 
as do the arms embargo and trade restrictions on goods for Iran’s missile programme. 
Over 100 German businesses participated in the German-Iranian Business Forum in Tehran on 3 May 2016. 
Following talks with the E3, Iran signed the additional protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. 
In 2004, Iran signed the Paris agreement, in which it agreed to temporarily halt its enrichment activities. 
Two years later, the new President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced that these activities would be restarted. 
The US, Russia and China joined the E3 negotiating group that year, after the EU had become involved in the process as coordinator. The group thus became the E3/EU+3, and still exists in this form. 
Following repeated calls for cooperation and transparency, the IAEA submitted the case to the UN Security Council in February 2006, 
At the same time, measures including sanctions on trade in sensitive nuclear-related goods and in the financial sector, as well as visa bans, asset freezes and ultimately an arms embargo, were agreed. 
Fordow underground enrichment plant began operating in 2009; uranium enrichment of up to 20 per cent started in 2010; and a further IAEA report containing information on a possible military scale of Iran’s nuclear programme was published in 2011. 
The US and the EU tightened their sanctions several times during this period. 
On the one hand, Iran was offered comprehensive cooperation should it comply with the international community on the question of its nuclear programme. 
Under the Joint Plan of Action, which was extended several times, it was possible to halt the development of Iran’s nuclear programme and to reverse some aspects of it. 
In return, the EU and the US suspended sanctions in certain specific areas. 
Also in 2013, the IAEA and Iran agreed in Tehran on a Joint Statement on a Framework for Cooperation. 
The Joint Plan of Action’s entry into force on 20 January 2014 opened up the possibility for negotiations on a comprehensive solution in the nuclear dossier. 
In return, UN, EU and US sanctions would gradually be eased. 
This was the basis for the Vienna agreement, which was reached on 14 July 2015. 
The breakthrough for the Vienna agreement came after over two weeks of intense negotiations. 
The Foreign Ministers of the US, UK, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran convened in Vienna from 28 June 2015 to negotiate an agreement on the basis of the Joint Plan of Action and the basic political agreement reached in Lausanne in April. 
The EU was represented by Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who coordinated the talks. 
Terrorist attack in northern Mali 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (18 January 2017) at the governmental press conference: 
Initial reports suggest several dozen have been killed and injured, mainly rebels, who during the peace process began to guard certain places in Gao as part of joint security patrols. 
We utterly condemn this attack on the peace process in Mali. 
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of the victims and to the many who have been injured. 
The joint security patrols in northern Mali are, as confidence-building measures, an important component in the peace process. 
The Government, rebels and pro-Government militia are to work together to guarantee security in northern Mali. 
The training programmes do not just include the annual seminars but also in-service courses for junior diplomats working at the foreign missions of their countries in Germany. 
Alongside the German-language Diplomatenkolleg and the International Diplomats Programme conducted in English, an EU-Kolleg was set up in 2010 to provide information on European policy to diplomats posted in Berlin from other EU member states. 
At the heart of the Global Diplomacy Lab is the shared search for new and more inclusive diplomacy methods and the drafting of new approaches which go beyond conventional politics. 
There are also repeat programmes, meetings abroad and regular events in Germany for alumni. 
There are currently about 200 of our alumni working in missions in Germany, several of them ambassadors. 
"A few hours ago, we received news from Mali, from Gao in the north of the country, an area overrun by Islamist terrorists a few years ago and where the terrorists have been pushed back thanks to French intervention and the joint efforts of the international community. 
We have to presume that there has now been a terrorist attack there aiming to sabotage the peace process in Mali.

Africa is bursting with potential. 
A young, growing population, rich in natural resources and strong growth rates. 
Yet, on average living standards are lower than in any other continent. 
What strategy is Germany adopting to use the opportunities for the German and African economies fairly and sustainably?

No continent is growing as quickly as Africa both in economic and demographic terms. 
In the last ten years, investment by German businesses has doubled. 
Political instability, corruption and poor infrastructure are a major obstacle to investment in many countries, thus also hampering development and prosperity. 
Furthermore, many African economies are heavily dependent on the export of raw materials which entails high risks given the price fluctuations on the global market. 
A continent on the rise 
Bild Engineering training… 
Nevertheless, the growing importance of Africa as a location for business and investment is reflected in global trade. 
For Germany as an exporting nation, Africa has huge as yet untapped potential. 
Shared markets, customs and monetary unions make the regions more attractive to foreign investors and for cooperation. 
Strategy for fair growth 
The Federal Government is pursuing a comprehensive strategy for fair and sustainable growth in Africa. 
German development cooperation plays a key role. 
The world is out of joint and Europe is in an identity crisis. 
This is why Germany is working comprehensively in the sphere of education and research in Africa. 
There are also over 550 university cooperation projects. 
Europe is under pressure, and people in Germany are also noticing this. 
The Federal Foreign Office is supporting the Africa initiatives of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research here. 
At the same time, we are also facing internal threats. 
We want to talk about what solutions we can find and what binds us together in Europe. 
Germany is the largest country in the European Union, and in these difficult times it is also the strongest and most stable country. 
This entails responsibility. 
And everyone is looking to us. 
Despite all the difficulties, we have always managed to find joint European solutions. 
Grexit was prevented. Brexit was decided by the British. 
How stable is Europe? 
What has Europe learned from this? 
In annexing Crimea, Russia did not only violate international law, but also undermined the cornerstones of Europe’s peaceful order. 
However, it did prove possible to agree on the Minsk road map, to prevent an outright war in the heart of Europe and to maintain a dialogue between the two parties to the conflict. 
But we do not see any alternative to the Minsk agreement, no matter how challenging it is. 
That is why we are continuing to talk with both sides. 
The European community of shared values was already severely tested by the financial crisis. 
The financial crisis and migration flows are a great test of this strength. 
We responded to the refugee crisis in record-breaking time. 
We are working on the necessary Europe-wide standardisation of asylum law. 
As an observer of many negotiations, I can assure you that talks with the European Parliament can be extremely tough. 
What does the Federal Foreign Office expect from dialogue with the public? 
Europe has a future when people see their future in their Europe. 
Interview conducted by Michael Seidel 
Interview with Martin Schäfer, Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson, on the panel discussion, What kind of Europe do we want?, in Schwerin on 23 January. 
For many years, war and disorder were far away for us in Germany. Peace in Europe seemed like something we could take for granted. 
How this has changed in just a few years! 
Populists who want to turn back time and who oversimplify things are gaining ground – and this is also the case in Germany. 
This means it is all the more important that we seek dialogue with the public. 
First the bank bailout, then the drama with Greece, and after that the refugee crisis – 
many Germans felt they were being made to pay for the transgressions of other EU members. 
How would you respond to this? 
But Germany is also the country that still gains the most from the European integration process. 
These are often compromises, a matter of give and take. But they are never unilateral. 
OECD Health Ministerial on 16 and 17 January 2017 
expanding patient-centred care, health care spending, new technologies and integrating data and big data into the health care system. 
The conference participants adopted a ministerial statement on the further development of health care policies. 
The statement reaffirms the OECD’s mandate to continue to develop methods for data- and indicator-based comparisons of health care systems and their performance. 
The OECD health forum took place on 16 January, followed by the OECD Health Ministerial entitled Putting People at the Centre: The Future of Health. 
If we look at the latest escalation in the Balkans, where Serbia threatened Kosovo with military action because it wouldn’t allow a train to pass, is it certain that there won’t be a return to the battlefield? 
Who would have thought that we would only be able to prevent a large-scale military conflict in the heart of Europe in the past two years through great efforts? 
We are striving side by side with France to mediate between Russia and Ukraine in the Donbass and to prevent any form of escalation. 
In this case, too, only the EU can repeatedly bring former bitter enemies to the negotiating table. 
The new US President, Donald Trump, has predicted that other countries will leave the EU. 
Brexit was a shock for everyone - including the British themselves, I think. 
However, it soon became clear that the remaining 27 members stand firmly behind the EU as a joint project of peace and liberty. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier very consciously wants to step outside the political bubble in Berlin and to talk with members of the public all over the country. His aim is to gather ideas that will then be included in our vision for the future of Europe. 
France and Germany’s endeavours to overcome the conflict in eastern Ukraine are complex and protracted. 
It is exceptionally difficult to make concrete progress. Relations between Moscow and Kyiv are very tense. 
It almost collapsed during the refugee crisis. 
Can a community so lacking in solidarity recover from this rift? 
The EU institutions are facing a crisis of legitimacy. 
And it is true that some countries have shown less solidarity than we had hoped. 
Visible progress has been made as regards the protection of our external borders. 
You mention widespread prejudices that I do not share. 
Nevertheless, in this new situation, with a new US President, a difficult neighbour in Russia, crises at the continent’s borders and the internal dangers of populism and nationalism, Europe needs to reinvent itself to some extent and to create common awareness of what truly are the values and interests of our unique community. 
We expect a lively discussion, critical opinions and involvement in Europe, which will give us new, creative ideas on how we can work together to develop the continent further.

Human Rights Commissioner on the death of Turkmenistan’s former border service chief 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, today (20 January) issued the following statement on the death of Tirkish Tyrmyev, former head of Turkmenistan’s border service: 
Tyrmyev was one of the most prominent figures on a list kept by human rights activists of 88 detainees in Turkmenistan whose whereabouts are unknown and some of whom have been allowed no contact with the outside world for 15 years. 
I call on the Turkmen Government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Tirkish Tyrmyev quickly and thoroughly. 
I equally call on the Turkmen Government to investigate the accusations of torture in prisons and to ensure that all prisoners are treated humanely. 
This assurance must now be put into practice. 
Former high-ranking security official Tirkish Tyrmyev, who has died aged 66, was arrested in April 2002 on charges of abuse of power. 
The forum on 16 January in the form of a panel discussion on the topic of patient-centred care was supplemented by contributions from representatives of the Commonwealth Fund, as well as the Harvard Business School. 
On 17 January, ministers and representatives from a total of 44 countries, 35 of which are OECD member countries, discussed measures, ambitions and challenges for the next generation of health reforms. 
The Federal Foreign Office on the situation in the Gambia 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (22 January) on the situation in the Gambia: 
Further work done by the OSCE is to focus, among other things, on proposals and recommendations for continuing to develop patient questionnaire data on treatment experiences and results. 
These days, however, are marked by a new global disorder – and more, much more, is at stake: 
I know that we must prepare ourselves for troubled times ahead, for unpredictable developments and new uncertainties. 
However, I trust that our words will fall on receptive ears in Washington. I hope the new administration knows that big countries, too, need partners in this world, and that it is willing to pursue its objectives with good friends and proven Allies at its side. 
With the election of Donald Trump, the old world of the 20th century has been relegated to the history books. 
We live in a historical hiatus, because the post-war order and also the quarter century after the fall of the Wall have come to an end. 
Not only Donald Trump has assumed office, but his team, too, will rapidly take up its government duties. 
The fact that former Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has respected the election result of 1 December 2016 and is ceding power to his democratically elected successor Adama Barrow is good news and long overdue. 
This peaceful solution would have been impossible were it not for the persistent and concerted mediation efforts on the part of the international community – especially the neighbouring countries and the regional organisation ECOWAS. 
The priority now is for the President elected by the Gambian people to swiftly live up to his responsibility. 
Germany will, together with the international community, continue to support the Gambia on its path towards democracy and the rule of law. 
I am shocked by reports from Turkmenistan that Tirkish Tyrmyev died in custody on 13 January, having been imprisoned for many years. 
Nine others on the list besides Tyrmyev have died in custody in the past few years; there are indications that torture is used in the prisons. 
I welcome the assurance given by Turkmen President Berdymukhamedov that international diplomats are to be allowed access to the prisons where the so-called “disappeared” are being held. 
His relatives, to whom his body has now been returned, last saw him during his trial in May 2002. 
As with all transitions of power, there are uncertainties, doubts and question marks concerning the course the new leadership will take. 
The forms of global order that will prevail in the 21st century, and what the world of tomorrow will look like, have not yet been determined and are completely open. 
We will seek dialogue, and we will explain to the new administration our position, our values and our interests. 
We want to make perfectly clear what we envision for and expect of a partnership of equals between Europe and the United States, a partnership that must be re-consolidated. 
Free trade, exchange and an open world, unity in the fight against extremism and terrorism, as well as close transatlantic cooperation that is based on trust and shared values are at the very top of our agenda.

This is also increasing demand for the expansion of infrastructure such as railways, roads and pipelines and of air traffic.

Sustainable growth needs innovation. 
The continent's ongoing poor image as far as the economy is concerned has for a long time now been at odds with the dynamic development figures. 
Of all topics, what drives you to seek dialogue with the public on this not very promising question? 
This is a lengthy process and it can be frustrating at times – but it is always better than using violence or even the battlefield to deal with our conflicts, the way we did in the past. 
We are more affected by crises and conflicts, such as in Ukraine, the Middle East and North Africa, and we are experiencing migration flows and Islamist terrorism. 
We have made great progress in conflict management in the Balkans in the past 20 years, but there are now tensions once again. 
When we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome in March, we want to present concrete results. 
Shortly before his death, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said that Europe hadn’t come off well in their handling of the Russia/Ukraine crisis. 
The EU has been criticised for not dealing adequately with Russia and for working with dubious protagonists in Ukraine. 
As in real life, times of crisis reveal whether solidarity is strong enough. 
I am confident that everyone recognises just how much we Europeans are a community with a common destiny – a community that should stand together and do its utmost to defend its diverse, tolerant and free way of life. 
The European Parliament is regarded as an overpaid machine that just rubber‑stamps things, while the Commission is seen as a supreme government with no democratic mandate. 
The MEPs do not simply rubber‑stamp things – they want to play an active role in decision‑making.

Federal Foreign Office on the approval of 566 housing units in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (23 January) on the granting of building permits for 566 housing units in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem: 
Dealing with the past 
A responsible approach to the past forms the basis ... 
We are following these developments with great concern and have made our position clear on repeated occasions. 
@ Federal Photo Archives 
"I am moved as I today reach out to you across the graves of those who died during the Warsaw Uprising. 
Yesterday, the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee granted construction approvals for a total of 566 housing units in East Jerusalem. 
I bow to those who fought in the Warsaw Uprising and to all Polish victims of the war: 
Construction approvals for further new housing units in East Jerusalem settlements are on the agenda of tomorrow’s committee meeting. 
This decision comes at a time when further construction approvals and the expansion of settlements are under discussion in Israel. 
Both sides continue to be called upon to refrain from unilateral measures that pose a risk of renewed escalation, to reaffirm their commitment to the two-state solution and to back this up with specific measures as expressed in the recommendations made by the Quartet report of July 2016. 
On 22 January, the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee granted construction approvals for a total of 566 housing units in the East Jerusalem settlements of Ramat Shlomo, Ramot and Pisgat Ze’ev. This is the final step in the process of approval. 
Settlement construction in occupied territories, and therefore also in East Jerusalem, is a violation of international law and jeopardises lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, which can only be achieved through a negotiated two-state solution. 
He spoke of Cousin and Grandi as “the directors of our two most important partners for humanitarian aid”. 
Germany is the second largest donor of humanitarian aid 
Steinmeier went on to say that the Federal Foreign Office’s funds for humanitarian aid currently amount to some 1.2 billion euros. 
This makes Germany the world’s second-largest bilateral donor country. 
“There remains a large need for humanitarian aid,” the German Foreign Minister said. 
The international community must actively work to accelerate the search for political solutions. 
Federal President Joachim Gauck and Daniela Schadt will visit the French Republic on 25 and 26 January 2017. 
As his term of office draws to an end, the Federal President will be welcomed in Paris for talks by French President François Hollande.

On Monday (23 January), Foreign Minister Steinmeier received World Food Programme Executive Director Ertharin Cousin at the Federal Foreign Office. 
In the afternoon, the German Foreign Minister also met with UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. 
The meetings focused on the world’s humanitarian crises, the state of the humanitarian system and the Federal Government’s current aid efforts. 
At a joint press conference with the head of the World Food Programme and the UNHCR, Steinmeier praised their close cooperation.

Since 2013, funding has been increased sixfold, he added. 
In their statements, Cousin and Grandi expressed their thanks for Germany’s humanitarian aid efforts in general, and in particular for the support that Germany provides to their respective institutions. 
Regarding Germany’s support for the World Food Programme and the UNHCR, Steinmeier said it is provided “in good conscience 
... because we know they are doing professional work, and that the aid gets to where it is needed”. 
Meeting addressed the situation in Syria 
Today’s talks also addressed the situation in Syria. 
He went on to say that Germany is offering to assume responsibility by co‑hosting a conference on Syria in April. 
The current talks in Astana can only be an “intermediate step,” Steinmeier insisted, 
“because a political solution for Syria can only be found in Geneva, with the participation of the International Syria Support Group.” 
South Sudan, Somalia, the Lake Chad region and Burundi were discussed. 
“That is why last year we more than doubled our funding for Africa, whereby we were able to provide an additional 150 million euros,” Steinmeier said. 
The exhibition was funded by the Federal Foreign Office and first shown at the building of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in June 2016 to mark World Refugee Day. 
The exhibition will be on view in the Atrium of the Federal Foreign Office from 27 January to 9 March 2017. 
On Monday (23 January), Foreign Minister Steinmeier met with World Food Programme Executive Director Ertharin Cousin and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. 
The German Foreign Minister highlighted the significant role that the staff of these two institutions plays in trouble spots around the world, by providing assistance under difficult conditions. 
The agenda also included discussions on crises that normally do not receive much attention in the media.

The GFFA 2017 was entitled “Agriculture and Water – Key to Feeding the World”. 
Minister of State Böhmer issued the following statement on the conference: 
“Around 700 million people around the world still do not have access to clean drinking water – with catastrophic impacts on health. 
Only its sustainable use will ensure long-term food security, which also helps to prevent conflicts over water.” 
Minister of State Böhmer opened the 9th Berlin Agriculture Ministers’ Conference in the Weltsaal of the Federal Foreign Office on 21 January together with Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture Schmidt. 
“Conflicts over water have already begun” 
Böhmer said that conflicts over water had already begun 
The focus of today’s conference is therefore on how we can safeguard the sustainable and diverse production of food to feed a growing world population as well as tackle water crises.” 
The Agriculture Ministers’ Conference is the most important element of the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture (GFFA). Taking place annually at the International Green Week in Berlin, it is an international conference that focuses on central questions concerning the future of the global agri-food industry. 
and that this was increasingly giving rise to regional and international conflicts. 
“With this in mind, we are working to promote dialogue processes between neighbouring countries in order to build trust. 
Other partners include international organisations such as the European Commission, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as organisations from the worlds of business, academia and civil society. 
This posed a particular challenge for foreign policy: 
The GFFA is organised by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture in cooperation with the Berlin Senate, Messe Berlin GmbH and GFFA Berlin e.V. 
Federal Foreign Office statement on liberation of eastern Mosul 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (25 January) after eastern Mosul was liberated from IS: 
The liberation of eastern Mosul is an important step in the fight against IS in Iraq. 
As it demonstrates, 
the IS terrorists are increasingly on the defensive. 
The support of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL is contributing to that progress. 
We commend Prime Minister al‑Abadi’s Government and the Iraqi security forces for their determined action and systematic approach. 
This achievement would also not have been possible without the Kurdish Peshmerga. 
The vital thing now is to swiftly restore security in the eastern part of the city and to ensure access to supplies for the inhabitants who have managed to survive these terrible years under the nightmare of IS terror. 
People want to get back to normal life quickly. 
We are already seeing a return to something like normality in some areas, as people regain the confidence to go out in the street and markets are opened. 
With German support, the United Nations has launched a number of initials stabilisation measures on the ground to, for example, restore electricity supplies and healthcare clinics. 
Humanitarian need remains extremely high, as the toughest challenge still lies ahead: 
hundreds of thousands of people in the western part of the city are still in the hands of IS, trying to survive in the most difficult of conditions. 
Thousands have already returned to the liberated districts and southern suburbs. 
Germany is one of Iraq’s largest humanitarian donors, contributing crucial funding. Last year it provided almost 120 million euros, much of which has been benefiting the people in and around Mosul. 
This support helps keep people supplied with clean water and food as well as ensuring basic medical care. 
From student exchanges to the Lifelong Learning Programme: the Erasmus Programme is celebrating its 30th birthday in 2017.

Ten million people experiencing foreign countries 
A semester in Italy, an internship in Poland, a volunteering project in Lithuania – by the end of 2017, almost ten million people will have been abroad with the European education and exchange programme Erasmus+, around 1.2 million of them from Germany. 
All 28 EU member states are involved in the Erasmus Programme, as are Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Turkey. 
The Erasmus Programme was established in 1987 and quickly grew into the largest programme funding periods of study at foreign universities. 
Primarily, however, it commemorates Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Dutch Renaissance humanist who lived in a great variety of places across Europe and travelled the continent widely. 
Programme with a broad portfolio 
Bild Programmheft 
A popular programme – millions of young people have taken part in Erasmus. 
The Erasmus Student Charter 
The programme is extremely popular. 
Even in its very first year, 1987, it helped 3244 students from 11 different countries spend time studying abroad. 
By 2013/2014, the numbers were at more than 272,000. 
The portfolio has been broadened since its inception. 
Nowadays, funding goes not only on periods of study abroad but also internships, volunteering, stints abroad in connection with school or lifelong learning, traineeship programmes, teaching opportunities and further training for university staff. 
The Erasmus Programme was merged with other funding programmes to form Erasmus+ in 2014. 
A budget of 14.7 billion euros is available for the various programmes between 2014 and 2020. 
Anniversary events 
A major anniversary celebration was held in Berlin on 24 January. 
A number of conferences, forums, dialogues, debates and exhibitions will be held across Europe throughout the year to mark the Erasmus anniversary.

Exchange programme for all of Europe – Erasmus turns 30 
It has enabled millions of young people not only to study together but also to live, party, fall in love and debate ideas with one another. 
This has eroded prejudices and helped advance the idea of a shared Europe. 
Erasmus stands for the internationalist European ideal more than any other programme. 
The aim of the Business Forum was to discuss how the German architecture, planning and construction sectors can help to solve the many global challenges. 
This year’s Business Forum addressed topical issues in the construction industry and discussed opportunities for the German building trade. 
The regional focus was on Iran and Africa, while energy-efficient construction, water supply and transport were the main sectors discussed. 
On 25 January 2017, the Business Forum on Architecture, Planning and Construction took place at the Federal Foreign Office for the fifth time. 
This year’s event focused on the topic of construction worldwide and on how German expertise can help to meet global challenges. 
Böhmer explained that the goals of sustainability, water supply and urban planning aimed at providing affordable living space had been included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to underline their crucial importance. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier meets his Czech counterpart Zaorálek 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met his Czech counterpart Lubomír Zaorálek for talks at the Federal Foreign Office on Wednesday (25 January). 
and especially on the 20th anniversary of the German-Czech Declaration of 1997.

At a joint press conference with his Czech counterpart following the meeting, Foreign Minister Steinmeier took a look back at German-Czech relations, 
saying they had seen particularly fruitful development over the past few years. 
Comparing bilateral relations today with the situation in the post-war period or in the 1970s and 80s, Steinmeier said, “a huge amount has changed”. 
This, the Minister continued, “involved the unbureaucratic provision of care for emergencies in the border area”, as well as “support for the German-Czech Future Fund” and the German-Czech Discussion Forum. 
People as bridge-builders 
This had also fed into the German-Czech Declaration on Mutual Relations and their Future Development of 21 January 1997, the 20th anniversary of which the two Foreign Ministers were marking.

The task now, Steinmeier said, was to “try even more determinedly to resolve this European crisis”. 
He and his Czech colleague were in agreement that

Stabilisation in Mali: 
The Federal Foreign Office is funding peace dialogues and the establishment of a truth commission 
For three days they sat on mats under canvas tents in Gargando, a small town near the Malian desert city of Timbuktu, talking and talking. 
Many of those present had long since stopped regarding Mali as their country.

On a hot day in March 2016, they stood solemnly together in billowing robes and military uniforms. 
The flag of the armed rebel group that had ruled in the area was lowered and the Malian flag raised. 
The national anthem was even played. 
“That was one of those moments that give you goosebumps,” says Rebekka Rust, project manager of the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Mali. 
Rebekka Rust organises forums like the one in Gargando on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance. 
The dialogue produced a dynamic which no-one could have planned for or foreseen, she says. 
“With the help of traditional leaders, we managed to get people talking to each other who had had absolutely no contact since the crisis erupted.” 
Working on the roots of the conflict 
The peace dialogue in Gargando is just one of several dozen organised by GIZ. Sometimes they need months of preparation. 
In order to show that rapprochement and reconciliation are worthwhile, the talks are accompanied by small-scale stabilisation projects: perhaps the rebuilding of a children's basketball court destroyed by the jihadists, or the construction of a new road or repair of a well. 
Every individual peace dialogue is a small step in a large conflict, but if the people of the north and south cannot move closer to each other, then you can send as many MINUSMA soldiers to Mali as you like – the violence threatens to erupt in waves again and again. 
To achieve lasting stabilisation, you have to tackle the causes. 
That is why the Federal Foreign Office has provided a total of 5.5 million euros since 2013 to support reconciliation work in Mali. 
An additional 9.12 million are earmarked for 2017 and 2018.

The root conflict in Mali is already several generations old. It is a classic conflict between herdsmen and farmers for land and water, scarce resources. 
The south, by contrast, is dominated by the Bambara ethnic group, lives on agriculture and in cultural terms belongs to sub-Saharan Africa. 
The majority of southern Malians only converted to Islam in response to colonisation by the French. 
The peoples of the south dominate the Government and have neglected the north for decades. 
“There’s never been anything done to work through all that,” says GIZ project manager Rust. 
“This conflict is also about equal opportunities, participation and recognition.” 
Microprojects: 
peace should be worthwhile for the people

If the population is to withdraw its support from the extremist groups, then it has to be convinced that peace is worthwhile for the people. 
In order to stabilise the fragile situation, the Federal Foreign Office is expanding the microprojects that accompany the peace dialogues – projects like a grain silo for a multiethnic women’s cooperative in Gao, where Bundeswehr soldiers are also stationed. 
In the dialogue forums people decide together what their community needs. 
“If we are to be reconciled, we need to know the truth,” he stresses. 
Interviews are to be conducted all across the country this year. 
Germany, she feels, is predestined for this task. 
Firstly, because it is regarded as neutral. 
Germany’s example, adds Mohamed, can also give the Malian people courage. 
He says he often tells his compatriots 
The meeting focused on bilateral relations, the state and future of Europe, 
Beyond the official political level, however, it was in the first instance the people of the two countries who had proved their worth as “bridge-builders”, Steinmeier said. 
Another important topic, besides bilateral relations, was the current state of the European Union. 
The German Foreign Minister and his Czech counterpart also discussed the future of Europe and possible ways out of the crisis. 
“for this Europe, for the European Union, for European integration, there is no real alternative for our two countries”. 
Developing relations at political level, he said, included a “strategic dialogue” initiated by the Foreign Ministers.

Focus on the future of Europe 
The Ministers at the press conference 
On Friday, 27 January 2017, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will officially hand over the reins of office to his successor Sigmar Gabriel. 
The ceremony will be attended by Federal Foreign Office staff and other invited guests. 
Official handover by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to his successor Sigmar Gabriel 
Office of the Federal President 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism 
We cannot change or undo what has occurred. 
To us, our history is a lesson, an admonition and a calling. 
Remembrance cannot, and must never, end. 
Whether you believe it or not, 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier issued the following statement today (27 January) on the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism: 
Auschwitz extermination camp was liberated 72 years ago today. 
We do, however, have both a duty and an obligation to recall the ultimate betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah, to commemorate the victims, and to assume our present‑day responsibility in this connection. 
The name Auschwitz and this day remind us of all the death camps and of the National Socialist persecution and killing machine – a terrible, unforgotten and ever‑present chapter in the history of our country. 
Especially in this day and age, when quite a few certainties are being called into question, and when the world around us may appear unsafe, restless and lacking in order, days like today, and taking time to reflect on our past, are of great importance. 
and that therefore our country would face greater responsibilities. 
We had the Ebola crisis. 
Looking back now, I would say that 
We had the new confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
We never had a dry run to practise this “more responsibility” idea. We were thrown in at the deep end. 
The international crises have tested our readiness to assume responsibility from day one. And we rose to the challenge! 
This parliament did not, as is now sadly the fashion in so many parts of the world, start screaming: 
Instead you all took your responsibilities seriously, and acted accordingly. 
For that I want to thank you. 
Today’s topic, our engagement in Iraq, is an example of this increased responsibility. 
And let me stress that 
We always knew that 
we have never naively viewed this responsibility as one-sided in nature. 
military options might be involved. 
At the invitation of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, Minister of State Roth will also give a speech on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism at a remembrance ceremony for the persecuted and murdered Sinti and Roma at the Memorial to the Sinti and Roma of Europe persecuted and murdered under the National Socialist Regime. 
In Iraq alone we have invested 47 million euros in the past two years, as a result of which schools and hospitals are operating again, and power lines and water pipes have been repaired. 
That is seamless foreign policy in action. 
In the morning, a ceremony of remembrance will be held in the German Bundestag. 
Honoured members of this House, you may have heard the stubborn rumours that this could be my final speech to the Bundestag as Foreign Minister. 
I fear that this is not “fake news”, but something we must take seriously. 
I therefore hope you will indulge me in a final review of the past three years. 
I will do my best not to exceed my allocated time by more than a few hours... 
All joking aside – and in all brevity – 
27 January is Remembrance Day for the six million European Jews killed, the Sinti and Roma, the forced labourers, the prisoners of war left to starve to death, the people euthanised by the state, the homosexuals, all those who, for religious, political or simply humanitarian reasons, stood against the reign of terror and so fell victim to the strictures of the totalitarian regime. 
No, what I’m getting at is something much more basic. 
More responsibility, greater engagement in the world is not something that can be imposed from above. 
If our country’s role in the world is changing – and it is – 
this has to be discussed by our society as a whole! 
What I say now, I say not as a member of the Government, but as a member of this parliament. 
thank you for the resources made available to the Federal Foreign Office, which have grown year on year. 
we talked about foreign policy instruments. 
I am grateful to the subcommittee, to Ulla Schmidt, Claudia Roth, Peter Gauweiler and many others, for not only recognising the importance of our work but for also giving us the means to do it. 
And of course, honoured friends, we have held many intense debates on mandates, like the Iraq mandate today. 
Our disputes are never so long and so heated as they are when mandates are concerned! 
in the light of our past, it is definitely no bad thing that we Germans really wrestle with each individual decision to approve the use of military means. 
As much as I would like to see an active, self-confident German foreign policy, 
we would most surely not be a better country if we found it easy to send soldiers, police officers and aid workers off to crisis regions around the world. 
This is why the debates and controversies are so important. 
the major political shocks did not come from outside, but from within our Western societies – the Brexit bombshell from the UK, Donald Trump’s victory in the US, and now the upcoming elections in the Netherlands and France. 
I don’t yet know what these developments will mean in detail, any more than you do. 
But I do know one thing. 
When the line between domestic and foreign affairs becomes blurred, we must not allow parliamentarianism to be swept away. 
Firstly, in brief – 
keep on travelling! 
Foreign policy cannot be conducted in the comfort of your living room. That is just as true for MPs as for the foreign minister. 
You, my fellow MPs, have undertaken more than 2000 trips abroad in this parliamentary term. 
That’s even more than me! But that’s a good thing. 
Keep open the channels of communication, both bilaterally and through the international parliamentary assemblies of the OSCE, the Council of Europe and NATO, and through international exchange programmes with precisely those countries where democracy and parliamentarians are in peril. 
My second request concerns the future. 
That’s why I would like to ask all of you 
If we can’t escape greater international responsibility – and hopefully we don’t want to – then we need new MPs to be internationally aware. 
to instil in the next generation a spirit of international engagement. 
Encourage young people to broaden their horizons and look beyond Germany’s borders. 
It is important for us to have young MPs who are familiar with the world and know what the world thinks of us. 
We need these young people to play an active role in foreign relations. 
I am leaving this parliament as a member of the government, but I entered it as a member of the opposition. 
It’s no secret that 
But things didn’t work out that way... 
A great Social Democrat party chairman once said, 
“Opposition is crap.” A great SPD chairman said that... And in the SPD, 
you can never contradict the chairman, but you can perhaps interpret his words. 
That’s a good thing, and I hope that this sentiment will continue to be respected in this House. 
when I was elected to the Bundestag in 2009, I didn’t have my sights set on your seat, Thomas, but on one there in the front government benches. 
If the Opposition is crap, it is the dung that fertilises democracy! 
Willy Brandt, his years as Chancellor far behind him, once put it thus, as the oldest member of this House: 
“All members of this House perform equally important functions, whether they are on the government or opposition side, whether they hold power or hold it in check [...] Parliamentary responsibility for our state is borne by both sides equally, it is not the preserve of one side alone.” 
Today, we must apply Willy Brandt’s words of 34 years ago to foreign policy. 
Parliamentary democracy is under pressure around the world; in many places it is being called into question. 
I at least will miss it. 
You, my honoured colleagues, must now defend the space for democracy and the culture of democracy, within our society and outside it. 
If I can, I would be glad to help do this in any possible future capacity I may be privileged to hold ... but the defence of democracy can begin nowhere but here, at the heart of this House. 
I therefore urge you 
to make use of this floor! 
The Federal Foreign Office welcomes Foreign Minister Gabriel 
The handover ceremony opened with music, followed by a speech by State Secretary Markus Ederer, 
who gave a warm welcome to Foreign Minister Gabriel on behalf of all Federal Foreign Office staff and promised him the ministry’s full support in his new role.

Personal farewell speech by Steinmeier 
The first official visit of a Foreign Minister’s term of office carries special significance. 
“You’re a great team and I will miss you!” 
The two Ministers discussed the most pressing foreign policy challenges. 
Providing encouragement and ideas for Europe 
France’s Foreign Minister Ayrault receives Sigmar Gabriel 
Foreign Minister Gabriel thanked his predecessor 
The meeting focused on the future of Europe. 
Following the warm welcome in the Weltsaal, Foreign Minister Gabriel paid tribute to his predecessor, describing him as an “outstanding Foreign Minister”. 
“Together, France and Germany have always driven European integration – by providing impetus, courage and ideas – and that is the role they must assume right now,” Gabriel said. 
Cornerstones of German foreign policy 
Internal and external affairs could no longer be separated in our interconnected world. 
“There is still no region in the world in which people can live with as much freedom, democracy and security as they can in Europe,” Gabriel said. 
This world offered a great many opportunities, but there were also many conflicts, sources of friction and threats. 
The international challenges were increasing. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his French counterpart Ayrault 
First official visit to Paris 
Gabriel will undertake his first visit as German Foreign Minister on Saturday (28 January), 
when he will travel to Paris 
Their talks will focus on the crisis in the European Union, as well as on conflict-hit regions such as Syria and eastern Ukraine. 
“We are eyewitnesses to a recalibration of the world,” Gabriel said. 
Whether it be dangerous crises, global challenges or the future of the EU: 
Germany and France can achieve more together than by acting alone. 
After assuming office on Friday (27 January), Foreign Minister Gabriel departed early this morning (28 January) on a visit to Germany’s most important partner. 
The close friendship and partnership between Germany and France extends far beyond European issues. 
After receiving their letters of appointment and discharge from Federal President Gauck in Schloss Bellevue, Steinmeier and Gabriel gave speeches to ministry staff and a large number of guests in the packed Weltsaal at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Ederer highlighted the “unambiguous analysis, unflappable calmness and untiring dedication” that Steinmeier had shown in achieving German foreign policy goals. 
In view of a world that is out of joint, Steinmeier had insisted that Germany must act “earlier, more decisively and more tangibly”. 
He thanked the staff and their families warmly for their hard work. 
“We achieved things that make me proud, and I hope you feel the same way.” 
Steinmeier looked back on packed years marked by a large number of crises in the world. 
He was handing over a foreign service to Foreign Minister Gabriel that was “stronger than ever before”. 
He said that Steinmeier had restored the Federal Foreign Office to the position it merited in the German Government, not only in the eyes of the German public, but also internationally. 
Gabriel then addressed the staff of the Federal Foreign Office, saying that he wanted to build on his predecessor’s work. 
Speaking directly to his new colleagues, he said, 
“I would be very grateful to be able to count on your expertise and dedication so that we can steer our country in what are certainly not easy times through waters that are likely to remain troubled.” 
Gabriel went on to say that Europe, transatlantic relations and multilateralism were the cornerstones of German foreign policy. 
“Foreign policy today means conducting international politics that does justice to the longing for more equitable and stable globalisation with more winners and fewer losers.” 
Joint statement by German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders: 
His first trip abroad made a special point: 
With his first official visit taking him to Paris, Foreign Minister Gabriel clearly demonstrated why the friendship between Germany and France is absolutely essential. 
In Paris, he was received by his French counterpart Jean‑Marc Ayrault. 
He and his French colleague were in agreement that, for Europe to be strong, Europe’s citizens must be shown how invaluable EU integration is, and what great opportunites this can hold. 
Franco‑German teams to focus on key future issues 
That is why Gabriel and Ayrault agreed to establish Franco‑German teams comprising staff from both foreign ministries that will examine all important issues, such as the future of transatlantic relations. 
“It is important that, both on substance and publicly, Germany and France demonstrate they have common positions on nearly all issues.” 
Less than 24 hours after assuming office, Foreign Minister Gabriel’s first official visit made clear that Franco‑German friendship remains the bedrock of Germany’s foreign policy. 
On Friday (27 January), outgoing Foreign Minister Frank‑Walter Steinmeier handed over to his successor, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, at a ceremony at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Welcome! Frank‑Walter Steinmeier welcoming Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on his arrival at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Ederer said that Gabriel was taking over a very well‑organised ministry, which would stand by him in every way.

Ederer thanked Frank‑Walter Steinmeier warmly for his work and said it had been a pleasure to work for him. 
The outgoing Foreign Minister then gave a very personal speech to Federal Foreign Office staff, who he said had been close allies all the time. 
He also mentioned the Federal Foreign Office’s review process, which had launched the most comprehensive inventory ever of German foreign policy. 
Steinmeier said he looked forward to “continuing to work closely with the Federal Foreign Office” should he be elected Federal President in February. 
With regard to his predecessor’s future role, Gabriel said Steinmeier would be “the ideal Federal President” and he wished him strength and every success. 
to meet his French counterpart Jean‑Marc Ayrault. 
Our two countries are dedicating major efforts to the fight against terrorism. 
We are determined to do everything in our power to effectively combat the dangers of terrorism. 
That is what our citizens rightly expect of us, 
both here in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (30 January) on the attack on a mosque in Quebec: 
Germany and Canada are committed partners in the fight against terrorism. 
However, determined action against the perpetrators must not be taken at the expense of an open and free society. 
At this difficult time, we stand side by side with our Canadian friends and partners. 
Our thoughts are with the victims’ friends and families, and 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attack in Quebec 
I condemn the cruel attack on Muslims at prayer in a mosque in Quebec yesterday evening in the strongest possible terms. 
The attack was intended to strike at the heart of a nation renowned for its religious tolerance and diversity. 
Here in Europe, it is not our policy to stigmatise people because of their origins or their religion. 
We certainly do not believe that banning millions of people from entering a country because of their nationality, origins and religion can be the right approach in the fight against terrorism. 
However, that fight can only be won with a clear compass and a sound footing in a robust set of values. 
Furthermore, the protection of refugees as established in the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is a binding duty under international law and must not be compromised. 
Our embassies in Washington are currently working that out to establish what the US executive order means for our citizens with dual nationality and have placed urgent requests with their American contacts asking for explanations and clarity. 
We are determined to safeguard the rights of our citizens and will move swiftly to agree with the rest of the European Union on what steps now need to be taken to that end. 
Transatlantic Coordinator travels to Washington 
No-one had expected such an outcome. 
After all, the capital Bamako had hardly ever bothered about the northern regions with lots of sand and few inhabitants. 
But with the government and military representatives standing there, actually listening, they decided they wanted to give their shared homeland another chance. 
In the north of the country live the traditionally nomadic desert tribes of the Tuareg and Fula, who have been Islamicised for a very long time and whose history and culture are strongly influenced by North Africa and the Arab culture. 
Ever since the foundation of Mali, there have been repeated violent confrontations, involving serious human rights violations, even massacres. 
Anger and frustration at the Government were part of the reason why the Tuareg wanted to secede in 2012, some of them becoming radicalised and allying themselves with Arab jihadist groups seeking to use northern Mali as a safe haven. 
Before the French army’s intervention, the west African state was in danger of falling into the hands of international jihadists and disintegrating. 
“If the Germans and French managed to become close partners and friends despite all the millions of dead in the two World Wars, then so can we.” 
“Projects like this are of more use for peace than a thousand speeches,” says Zahabi Ould Sidi Mohamed, Mali’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Reconciliation, who is now chairman of the disarmament commission. 
To my current knowledge, there is no reason to doubt this. 
Together with the Ministry of National Reconciliation, GIZ has set up seven regional offices and trained staff members to document human rights violations. 
But also because “given our history, we come across as very credible when we say that it is important to confront the past”. 
For an America that pulls up the drawbridge will not be a good market for investors. 
At the end of the peace dialogue in Gargando, the rebel flag is swapped for the Malian one 
So a truth commission has been set up with German support. 
“What’s special is that we are not only addressing the latest crisis, we’re going right back to 1960,” says Rust. 
The transatlantic partnership will remain a key pillar of our foreign policy. 
We have an interest in further pursuing and intensifying close transatlantic cooperation based on the common values that make our Alliance so strong and unique. 
Only a few days after the inauguration of Donald Trump, Jürgen Hardt, Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation, will today (30 January) travel to Washington, DC, for official talks. 
I expect my counterparts will reassure me that the US remains fully committed to NATO and to its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty. 
I am however concerned about a time when the current positive mood in the stock markets regarding the policies of Donald Trump may sour. 
I will also express our expectation that all Germans entering the US will be treated equally – regardless of any other citizenship they may hold. 
With his decisions on trade and immigration, the new president is taking a fundamentally new direction on two issues that for several centuries have made America great: 
Through his actions, President Trump has sown doubt as to what the future course of US policy will be, as well as regarding the United States’ future role in the world. 
Ten days after the new administration of President Trump took up its duties, there is widespread uncertainty regarding the United States’ future policies. 
I will strongly campaign for these views in all my talks with congressmen and women, senators and members of the new administration. 
providing a safe refuge to people seeking protection, regardless of their faith, and pursuing free trade across borders. 
US courts will now examine whether the decisions to introduce import tariffs and to extensively restrict immigration of people from Muslim-majority countries are in line with the United States Constitution and international law. 
In my talks with members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as with members of the new administration, I will highlight our reservations about the president’s current policy. 
Then at the very latest, I hope the new president will realise that he will get his country into trouble by continuing all too rashly and simply to implement campaign promises. 
I said that we would have to expect a few upsets 
almost exactly three years have passed since we first discussed the grand coalition’s foreign policy guidelines here in the German Bundestag. 
I’ve dug out the statement I made then, and I have to say I’m slightly embarrassed by the predictions it contained. 
We had the first campaign by the IS militants who set out to subjugate all of northern Iraq. 
This isn’t a list of what happened over the past three years. All of this happened in the first six months! 
“Pull up the drawbridge, batten down the hatches – leave the world and its troubles outside.” 
We did not however confine ourselves to military options, but tried a comprehensive political approach. 
We knew that there could be no negotiating with the IS killers, and that we had in particular to support those who formed the first line of defence against IS barbarity. 
But to consolidate Iraq as a whole, to deprive the forces of terror of their breeding grounds, much more was and is needed: humanitarian assistance, of course, as well as political action in coordination with the central government of Iraq. 
Iraq is thus an example which shows that 
not only have our responsibilities grown, 
but so too have the foreign policy instruments at our disposal. 
With the support of the Bundestag, we have continuously enhanced our options, most tangibly in the field of stabilisation. 
Many of the people driven out by IS have therefore already been able to return to towns such as Tikrit, Fallujah and Ramadi. 
That’s what I like to see. 
we have indeed ventured to assume more responsibility! 
And this venture would not have succeeded without the German Bundestag. 
I’m not referring now to the fact that members Barnett, Karl, Leutert and Lindner hold the purse strings. 
It is something that can only be based on a society’s own moral compass. 
Firstly, we argued about what diplomatic approach to take – especially when dealing with difficult governments, where tensions are growing, as is the case with Russia and Turkey. 
Secondly, we discussed an increase in the resources available for foreign policy – and I do, after all, have my Foreign Minister’s hat on when I say 
By way of example I would like to mention the Guidelines on Civilian Crisis Prevention, a project close to the heart of many members of this House, the revival of arms control in Europe, as well as our cultural relations and education policy, the third and still underestimated pillar of our foreign policy. 
But it must be said that, 
Crises and conflicts – a world out of joint – you’ve heard my stock phrases so often over the past three years that some of you know them by rote... But something did change in 2016 and 2017: 
It is these that will decide the direction Europe will take and the shape of international cooperation to come, and it is thus on these that the effectiveness of our foreign policy will depend. 
you, the parliamentarians, have to bridge the gap, you have to form the link between the two sides. 
You have to take decisions here in the Bundestag on Germany’s involvement in the world at large, and you also have to explain to the people in your constituencies what is really going on in Syria, Russia and Turkey. 
Each and every one of you bears this responsibility – to explain the state of the world without simplification; to communicate our foreign policy without painting things black and white. 
This is a difficult task, but it is a truly noble one. 
Tell them, and spread the word in your parties, that time spent abroad is not wasted time for their careers. It is more likely to give them a boost up the ladder and prevent them from sliding back down. 
If I may, I will close with a personal comment. 
In too many countries, civil society and parliamentary opposition groups are facing increasing restrictions, and self-proclaimed “strongmen” have even made contempt for democratic debate a sovereign principle. 
At the same time, the Internet has created space for anonymous and disinhibited communication, in which each new wave of agitation generates more clicks than any facts or arguments; in which language has lost all moderation and the dividing line between the utterable and the ineffable is wearing increasingly thin. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the German Bundestag in the debate on the continued participation by German armed forces in training support for the security forces of the Kurdistan-Iraq regional government and the Iraqi armed forces 
Is he right? 
Global justice and international security are two sides of the same coin. 
– Germany is one of the world’s biggest donors of humanitarian aid today. 
Let us build on that. 
Thank you very much for your warm welcome. 
Above all, this was due to his persistent, unwavering and tireless efforts to contain conflicts and to make peace possible. 
What do they actually do? 
They just talk. 
The authors forgot the conclusion drawn by the book “The Sleepwalkers”, namely that not talking enough is dangerous. 
When the Federal Foreign Office takes its leave today of Frank-Walter Steinmeier, it does so with great appreciation for his achievements, both political and personal. 
However, that’s most likely not the only reason you’re so sorry to see him go. For he had an inimitable way of treating staff. 
And I’m certain that foreign policy will remain one of his passions as Federal President. 
The time is very much “out of joint”, as Frank-Walter Steinmeier used to say. 
But we’ve known each other since the days back in Lower Saxony. 
You were the media affairs officer in Gerhard Schröder’s State Chancellery, who by the way has always maintained that he employed you and Brigitte Zypries because you were the only ones who contradicted him during your interviews. 
I’ve learned much from you. 
All the best! 
And you may rest assured that I’m not nearly as bad as they say in the papers. 
So I’m quite confident that things won’t be as bad as some sections of the media have predicted. 
Now some people will think: not as bad is bad enough. 
But, after all, you’re here to prevent that! 
“Don’t do anything stupid! Don’t destroy my legacy!” 
Representing Germany’s economic interests and, at the same time, not sidelining human rights issues isn’t always easy, but it was necessary. 
Our Ministries also worked well together on other difficult issues. 
That, too, is the result of good cooperation. 
And how little credibility our calls for an end to protectionism would have today 
I’m therefore especially dependent on your expertise and advice. 
I’m counting on it and I’m grateful for it. 
He certainly earned his reputation at the Federal Ministry of Finance. 
And that should not change. 
Despite this being an election year, much is expected of our foreign policy. 
What stands out in my own mind is the rise of the new economic powers in Asia, which don’t feel the need to ask us what share of world trade belongs to them. 
We in Europe are diminishing in terms of numbers, while Africa, Asia and Latin America are growing. 
So is the resistance of the embattled middle classes, who see these trends as unacceptable. 
There are calls for isolation, for countries to go it alone, for them to withdraw into their national shells. 
Domestic and external affairs can no longer be separated in our interconnected world. 
At any rate, the cornerstones of Germany’s foreign policy are more important today than ever before: 
Foreign policy today means conducting international politics aimed at creating more equitable and stable globalisation with more winners and fewer losers. 
We have an answer for this: Europe. 
“upsets” turned out to be something of an understatement... We had the protests on the Maidan, followed by the illegal annexation of Crimea. 
I am proud that the Bundestag initiated this debate, that we did not shy away from discussing the issues ourselves and with the public. 
And because this noble task of yours is likely to become even more vital, I have two requests to make of you. 
How much courage these men and women must have had, for this decision can’t have been especially popular among ordinary citizens. 
So much is at stake in Europe this year. 
We can’t remain neutral here, for this will affect us all! 
We will have to fight for this Europe. 
That is one of the reasons why my first trip as Foreign Minister will take me to Paris tomorrow. 
The close transatlantic partnership is another fundamental principle of German foreign policy. 
That’s why I’m looking forward to meeting Rex Tillerson as soon as possible. 
I’m keen to hear his views on the challenges we face on both sides of the Atlantic. 
openness, honesty and defence of the ideas on which our constitutions are founded: 
democracy, freedom and the rule of law. 
That was illustrated not least by the work of my predecessor. 
In all of these fields we know that 
we cannot resolve anything by going it alone. 
Forest fires in Chile – support for those affected 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (31 January) on the forest fires in Chile: 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler greatly concerned about impending execution in Iran 
Hamid Ahmadi, who is now 25 years old, was sentenced to death in 2009. 
The countless wildfires have cost many lives and injured huge numbers of people. 
We share in Chile’s pain, and hope that it will soon prove possible to bring this inferno entirely under control. 
We will not leave the Chileans to cope on their own. 
It is hard to imagine how those who have lost everything in the fires and have literally been left with nothing feel today. 
Forest fires are still raging in Chile. A veritable inferno of destruction has blazed through the country. 
At this terrible time, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Chile. 
All of this will open up ground which we have to enter and use with determination and resolve. 
We have thus pledged 200,000 euros, which the German Red Cross will use in Chile to support the families affected and help to repair their homes, as well as to provide firefighting equipment and support the firefighters. 
And that was even true when it was absolutely clear that he was under great strain and enormous time pressure. 
You can see that he knows the classics. 
But it is indeed the case that the German Foreign Minister’s job during the last few years has been to counter the dangers of many different conflicts. 
Noch zu 1700584 – Website: 
In December 2016, however, Hamid Ahmadi was again sentenced to death. 
People fear losing control over their lives and they are attracted by movements which have reverted to nationalist answers and want to create the impression that these answers would enable ordinary citizens to take back control. 
“Those who want to contain the situation once more must remember that globalisation must mean justice for all and not wealth for the few.” 
My work in this office will continue to be guided by the idea that both must grow in importance at an equal pace. 
And always responsibility for one another. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler 
greatly concerned about impending execution in Iran 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (30 January) on reports according to which the young Iranian Hamid Ahmadi is at imminent risk of execution in Iran: 
The news that the execution of young Iranian Hamid Ahmadi could be imminent fills me with the very greatest concern. 
Should Hamid Ahmadi be executed, then this would be an unacceptable violation of international law. 
Iran has ratified not only the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which prohibit the execution of individuals who were minors at the time of an offence. 
I urgently appeal to the Iranian judicial authorities to refrain from carrying out this planned execution. 
Hamid Ahmadi must be given a fair trial under the rule of law – and without the imposition of the death penalty. 
Federal Foreign Office comments on the reported Iranian missile test 
Federal Foreign Office on the election of the new Chairperson of the African Union and the new Chairperson of the African Union Commission 
The Federal Government condemns such tests as a matter of principle. 
As the voice of Africa at the global level, the African Union benefits from the membership of all the continent’s countries. 
Given the current situation, such tests heighten tensions in the Near and Middle East. 
The African Union must play an increasingly important role with respect to the ongoing political and economic integration of Africa. 
Iran is called upon to avoid all actions that give rise to greater distrust. 
We welcome the fact that the UN Security Council will now review the matter. 
The future of our neighbouring continent Africa is of paramount importance for Europe. 
The news that Iran conducted another ballistic missile test on 29 January gives cause for serious concern. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson in Berlin today (31 January) commented as follows on reports that Iran conducted a ballistic missile test a few days ago: 
We welcome these appointments and intend to work closely with both leaders. 
The African Union filled two top positions for the next term at its 28th summit in Addis Ababa yesterday. 
Africa is taking responsibility in the area of peace and security, especially with regard to conflict prevention and conflict management, as well as in its efforts to build up the continent’s peace and security architecture. 
They are, in our view, incompatible with UN Security Council resolution 2231, which the United Nations Security Council agreed on in July 2015. 
What we need is de‑escalation, confidence building and the adoption of a constructive role by Iran in solving regional conflicts. 
Question: 
prevention, participation and protection. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (31 January) on the election of the new Chairperson of the African Union, Alpha Condé, and the new Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat: 
The African Union’s representativeness and ability to act are therefore also important for Germany. 
Germany and the European Union intend to cooperate with the African Union in a spirit of partnership and support the organisation's efforts to strengthen its structures. 
And not only within the Government but also publicly and internationally. 
I’m saying this because alongside the well‑known changes which are unsettling us there are very different changes taking place. 
we must remain oriented towards maintaining this principle! 
– Where political communication is lacking, Germany builds bridges through an active cultural relations and education policy. 
He will also meet with students. 
President Gauck will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Maastricht, and will give a speech on European policy at the ceremony. 
For without the excellent work in two Federal Cabinets, also at the Federal Chancellery, which – after all – you as his staff made possible, he would not now be on the brink of entering Schloss Bellevue. 
Inaugural speech by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on 27 January 2017 
Ladies and gentlemen, Esteemed colleagues, Frank‑Walter, Ms Wallat, Thank you very much for the warm reception for my family and for myself here at the Federal Foreign Office. 
I’m sure that for very many of you the departure of Frank-Walter Steinmeier today from the post of German Foreign Minister is, on the one hand, a source of great regret and, on the other perhaps, a source of pride. 
Regret because he really was a brilliant Foreign Minister who gave back to the Federal Foreign Office the status within the Federal Government to which this Office is entitled given its importance. 
In the oath of office, the Minister declares, “I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well‑being of the German people, promote their welfare, protect them from harm”. 
I believe that only a few Foreign Ministers of the Federal Republic have contributed to this welfare and to our country’s international reputation in such a convincing way as Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
I remember media reports in which commentators asked: 
He was people‑oriented and cooperative, never talked down to anyone and always had a sense of humour. 
There’s one quality in particular I’ve noticed over many years: whenever you go to him, you always have the impression that he’s been waiting for you all day and that nothing is more important to him at that moment than having a good conversation with you. 
It’s these skills, along with his aptitude for precision work, which have gained him the support of those around him in all of his posts to date – certainly also here at the Federal Foreign Office. 
As I said, however, perhaps you’re also a little proud that in all likelihood “your boss” will be the next President of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
Calling to mind a headline from the Bildzeitung, you couldn’t now say, “We are Pope” but you could say, “We are Federal President”. 
I think you’re entitled to be a little proud of that. 
In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the quote continues with the lament, “O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right!” 
Being a modest man, he would never have quoted that bit. 
Germany’s standing as an anchor of stability and a reliable partner today is due in no small measure to Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
The fact that many people are convinced he’s the ideal Federal President has a lot to do with this. 
I, too, would like to take this opportunity to express my respect – and to sincerely thank a man who has been a comrade-in-arms for many years. 
Frank, I thank you for the time we’ve spent working together. 
I don’t know if you remember. 
I still remember drafting Lower Saxony’s budget under the apple tree in my garden in Goslar along with you and Brigitte Zypries. 
You and I were in shorts. It says a lot for Brigitte Zypries that she could cope with that. 
I want to express my sincere thanks for everything we’ve managed to achieve during the last 20 years. 
But, above, all, I wish you a steady hand, stamina and good health for the great office that lies ahead. 
I’m very much aware that you were probably expecting a lot of things, but not Sigmar Gabriel as your new boss. 
In my personal experience, however, you can get used to such ideas in a relatively short space of time. 
Except for the ban on entering Iran which the Revolutionary Guards in Tehran threatened to slap on me after I pointed out Israel’s right to exist, none of my trips to any of the difficult countries in Arabia, Asia or Russia on the one hand, or Poland on the other, resulted in diplomatic relations being broken off with Germany. 
I think we’ll manage. 
Part of the reason I’m so keen to get things right is that I know the true message of your speech, Frank, was: 
You can be certain that I aim to work with you here at the Federal Foreign Office to carry on tackling the challenges facing us. 
No, seriously: during my stint as Economics Minister I benefited greatly from the assistance and guidance of the Federal Foreign Office. 
It was thanks to the unwavering support of the Federal Foreign Office that I found the right way and was also able to strike the right tone. 
And given the new protectionism, not only in the US, it was certainly especially important that Europe set a very different example and that it has laid down modern standards in world trade with the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada. 
In the weeks following the election of Donald Trump, I asked myself what the world would have said about Germany and Europe if we hadn’t managed to conclude this agreement with Canada. 
if we Europeans hadn’t even been able to conclude an agreement with Canada – a country which is more European than some EU member states. 
I’m therefore aware of this Ministry’s outstanding quality and I know that I can rely on it. 
I would be very grateful if I could count on your expertise and dedication so that we can steer our country through troubled waters in what are certainly not easy times. 
We should concern ourselves as little as possible with the fact that this is a federal election year. 
For the times as so rough that it’s essential that foreign policy is not focused on the election evening of 24 September but, rather, on our country’s medium and long‑term interests. 
And I firmly believe that you will give it to me. 
As you know, I will continue to act as the Federal Chancellor’s number two – as Deputy Chancellor. 
My remit includes political coordination with the Federal Chancellery, a task which is now coming here from the Federal Economics Ministry. 
In the forthcoming budget negotiations, that won’t necessarily be a bad thing for the Federal Foreign Office. 
State Secretary Dr Sontowski and his team will be transferring to the Federal Foreign Office to deal with this task. 
For a world which is so much in flux poses a challenge for us. 
I believe we’re witnessing a recalibration of the world at this moment. 
And when we host the Digital Affairs Ministers for the first time in April as part of Germany’s G20 Presidency, we do so in the awareness that the era of digital technology is changing our industrial model of prosperity and has thrown up new questions about common rules for fair competition and cyber security. 
In economic terms, the balance is shifting, the technological balance is changing and, of course, we’re also – unfortunately – witnessing a recalibration in the question of liberal and social democracy around the world. Authoritarian answers are on the rise and liberal and social democracies are, at the very least, on the defensive. 
This world offers a great many opportunities, but there are also many conflicts, sources of friction and threats. 
Refugee issues and migration, terrorism, wars and conflicts, as well as climate change, environmental disasters, cyber attacks – the international challenges are growing. 
As we know, this is a big mistake and that’s why it’s so important that we combine domestic and external affairs. 
Europe – and, no matter how difficult this may be for some – the transatlantic partnership, multilateralism. 
We will only generate more security if we strengthen global justice on a durable basis. 
I’ll never forget that just a few days after the devastating attacks of 9/11, I took part in an ecumenical service where a Catholic bishop, Josef Homeyer, said: 
Even though it’s in a difficult state today, Europe remains the biggest civilisation project of the 20th century. 
We owe it to our children and grandchildren to preserve a project built by people who suffered great hardship. 
Listening to some of the moaning about the difficulties facing Europe, I’ve asked myself time and again how it must have been for the French President, for the Belgians, Dutch, Luxembourgers and Italians to invite Germany to join them at the European table just a few years after a horrendous genocide. 
I believe we need this courage again today and there’s every reason to have it. 
For in no other part of the world do people – despite all our tribulations – enjoy more democracy or live in greater security than they do on the European continent. 
Indeed, the future of European integration as a whole is at stake in the presidential elections in France. 
And I’m certain that Europe will be a main focus of my work in the coming months. 
Regardless of the tone of the comments we are hearing from the US: 
Our hand should remain outstretched. We have to offer cooperation in a spirit of respect based on the values which have shaped transatlantic relations during the last few decades: 
However, we will have to show self‑confidence and fill the space which may be created if the United States turns away from international cooperation and in international trade. 
We will have to place the partnership with China on a new and fair footing, offer Europe and Germany as an alternative to the ASEAN states following the termination of the TPP trade agreement and use the Indo-German intergovernmental consultations and the G20 summit to present our country and Europe as a still fair but self‑assured partner. 
Let’s enter into this new chapter in a constructive spirit! 
You, my colleagues, demonstrate in your day‑to‑day work the effectiveness and diversity of the instruments which Germany uses in foreign policy and which we can employ to move things forward. 
– Germany is leading the way when it comes to fostering stability and post‑conflict peacebuilding. 
– Germany is therefore a respected and constructive mediator in conflict management. 
By contrast, we can achieve a lot if we work together. 
The Federal Republic of Germany is an active contributor of finance and personnel to the OSCE, 
providing just under 11% of the current OSCE budget, which makes it the second-largest contributor behind the United States. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel before flying to Washington 
The United States has always been our closest ally outside Europe. 
The world will not wait for us. 
There are pressing issues on the international agenda which require close liaison between Germany and America, as well as between Europe and America. 
There are questions we want to ask the new US Administration about its foreign policy, its relationship to the Alliance and the world order. 
I am therefore keen to meet my counterpart Rex Tillerson soon and am delighted by his invitation to Washington. 
Nothing – no telephone call, no video conference and no meeting on the margins of a major conference – can substitute a conversation in person. 
We want to explain to our American partners our view of things, our interests and values and are seeking a good, frank and friendly dialogue. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement last night (1 February) before flying to Washington: 
While the friendship between two nations is much more than constructive cooperation between their governments, good relations between governments based on mutual trust are essential. 
I hope for a direct and personal exchange and take with me to Washington the offer of friendship and trust. 
“Renewing dialogue, rebuilding trust, restoring security”. 
Programme and priorities 
At the close of Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship, Steinmeier – along with the Austrian and Italian Foreign Ministers – published an agenda for the future of a strong OSCE in a secure Europe.

Brochure for Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship [pdf, 422.96k] 
Germany set itself ambitious goals in all three OSCE dimensions. 
We worked hard to overcome conflicts in the OSCE area throughout Germany’s Chairmanship. 
Germany’s long-standing commitment to the OSCE 
Great names from Germany’s post-war history are associated with this policy: 
Nevertheless, for Germany the OSCE remains an integral part of the security architecture in Europe. 
Today, too, Germany is pursuing an active and constructive policy aimed at strengthening the OSCE and the values and principles for which it stands. 
Time and again, Germans have provided impetus at the head of various OSCE structures, for example Wilhelm Höynck as OSCE Secretary General (1993-1996), Freimut Duve as the first OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media (1998-2003) or Michael Georg Link, who is the current Director of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). 
Germany’s diverse contributions in and to the OSCE 
German staff are to be found in almost all the OSCE field missions and in OSCE institutions. All in all, Germany is providing more than 50 experts at present. 
Furthermore, Germany regularly contributes 10%, sometimes up to 15% – which is actually the limit prescribed by the OSCE – to the election observation missions run by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). 
As a rule, Germany presents its positions in joint EU declarations, which are coordinated between the delegations of the EU member states in Vienna. 
Germany also makes its voice heard through the work of the German delegation in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. 
A total of 13 deputies from all the parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag regularly take part in the Parliamentary Assembly sessions. 
In 2016, Germany had the responsible task of holding the OSCE Chairmanship. 
The OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in 2016 was the then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
He was assisted by the Special Representative of the Federal Government for the OSCE Chairmanship, Gernot Erler. 
Gernot Erler will remain our OSCE Special Representative in 2017. 
Germany’s OSCE Ambassador Eberhard Pohl headed the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna during Germany’s Chairmanship. 
Following 1991, Germany headed the world’s largest regional security organisation for the second time in 2016. 
Even after handing over to our successor, Austria, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen the OSCE. 
The motto of the German Chairmanship in 2016 highlighted fundamental goals which remain crucial in the light of the current crises: 
Germany championed these goals throughout the year. 
The trips by the Chairperson-in-Office in the OSCE area and the informal ministerial meeting in Potsdam on 1 September 2016 were key events. 
Trips by the Chairperson-in-Office during 2016 
In the intervals between OSCE Ministerial Councils – which take place at the end of every year in the country holding the Chairmanship – these bodies are the political and diplomatic heart of the OSCE where negotiations among the 57 participating States take place. 
Traditionally, Germany actively promotes the participation of civil society in OSCE debates and projects. 
This included protecting and better equipping the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), 
He will meet his US counterpart Rex Tillerson in Washington on Thursday. 
On Friday, Foreign Minister Gabriel will meet António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in New York. 
The White House in Washington 
Sigmar Gabriel has been German Foreign Minister for just under a week and his US counterpart Rex Tillerson took office on Wednesday. Gabriel is his first official guest. 
There are pressing issues on the international agenda which require close liaison between Germany and America, as well as between Europe and America,” Gabriel said prior to his departure for Washington. 
The fact that Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling so soon to the US is a sign of close transatlantic relations. 
The traditionally close relations between Germany and the US are based on shared values and historical experience. 
Both countries have close ties via NATO. 
talks with Tillerson and Pence 
“We want to explain to our American partners our view of things, our interests and values and are seeking a good, frank and friendly dialogue,” Gabriel said. 
Meeting with António Guterres 
A further meeting is planned for the following day in New York, 
where Foreign Minister Gabriel will meet António Guterres, who has taken over from Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
Gabriel is due to arrive back in Berlin early on Saturday morning. 
Gabriel travels to the US – urgent topics on the agenda 
A meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence is also planned. 
During their meeting, they will explore topics of importance to transatlantic relations in the future. 
Gabriel will also meet the new US Vice President, Mike Pence, to discuss common transatlantic issues. 
Transatlantic relations

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel’s second trip abroad will take him to the US on Thursday and Friday (2 and 3 February). 
First meeting between new colleagues 
Both ministers are new in office. 
Keeping up the good relations – 
These relations are to be kept up, and the first meeting between the new Foreign Ministers shortly after their appointment is an important step. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the latest announcements on settlements in the West Bank 
We are following the latest announcements by the Israeli Government on the expansion of settlements in the West Bank with great concern. 
This week alone, the Israeli Government has announced plans for the construction of 3,000 new housing units in the West Bank. 
The new scale of Israeli settlement policy feeds doubts that the Israeli Government still stands to its frequently reiterated commitment to a two-state solution. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (2 February) on the latest announcements on Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank: 
Plans for the construction of 2,500 new housing units were already made public last week. 
We hope and expect that the commitment to the two-state solution will be renewed and underpinned by practical steps, as called for by the Middle East Quartet, among others. 
In 1975, the Helsinki Final Act, the founding document of the CSCE/OSCE, laid the foundation for dialogue and cooperation beyond the divide of the Cold War. 
Helmut Schmidt, Willy Brandt, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Egon Bahr. 
“For us Germans, the dialogue of Helsinki is inextricably bound up with the round table dialogue in Berlin and the peaceful reunification of the two German states” – with these words in summer 2015 marking the 40th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, the then Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier stressed the influence of the CSCE/OSCE, especially on Germany. 
Germany has held the Chairmanship twice – in 1991 and then in 2016. 
The German Government also provides substantial support in the form of additional voluntary contributions to OSCE projects in the entire OSCE area; in 2016, for example, a total of 5.5 million euros was made available for 86 projects. 
Germany is an active participant in the meetings of the Permanent Council as well as in the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC), which is responsible for military issues. Both convene once a week in Vienna. 
One example of this is Germany’s commitment within the framework of the OSCE Network of Think Tanks and Academic Institutions, which is currently headed by Dr Wolfgang Zellner from the Centre for OSCE Research (CORE) in Hamburg. 
The meeting of OSCE Foreign Ministers in Potsdam on 1 September 
The motto for the year was “renewing dialogue, rebuilding trust, restoring security”. The German Government sought to strengthen OSCE instruments and institutions, promote dialogue among the participating States and take advantage of concrete opportunities for confidence-building. 
as well as our efforts to contain the renewed outbreak of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
Federal Foreign Office on the death of Étienne Tshisekedi 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (2 February) on the death of Étienne Tshisekedi: 
And for the first time in many years, plans on the foundation of a completely new settlement have been announced. 
For example, we are working closely with the Austrian (2017) and Italian (2018) Chairmanships as part of the OSCE Troika. 
We call on all political actors to respect the interim agreement of 31 December 2016, which Étienne Tshisekedi had played a major role in bringing about, and to work to achieve its implementation immediately and without delay so that peaceful and democratic elections can be held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
During the 40 years that have passed since then, there have been major changes. 
With the death of Étienne Tshisekedi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has lost a politician who played a prominent role in Congolese political life for many years and who was strongly committed to the future of the country and its people to the last. 
We extend our condolences to the family of the deceased and to the Congolese people. 
Both are new in office. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel left for a two-day visit to the US on Thursday (2 February). 
Sigmar Gabriel with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 
Sigmar Gabriel has been German Foreign Minister for just under a week and his US counterpart Rex Tillerson took office on Wednesday. Gabriel is the first counterpart to be received by Tillerson. 
The fact that Gabriel is travelling so soon to the US is a sign of close transatlantic relations. 
In addition, both countries have close ties via NATO. 
Gabriel underlined that no other region outside Europe was as close to Germany as the US. 
“We are closely united by shared values,” Gabriel said, “but these values must be upheld.” 
In the afternoon, Gabriel visited the White House, 
where he met Vice President Mike Pence. 
“It was good to visit the US at this early stage,” Gabriel said. 
“We laid a good foundation for further talks,” Gabriel concluded. 
Visit to New York

German version of the US Declaration of Independence in the Library of Congress 
After arriving in Washington, Foreign Minister Gabriel met members of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in the US Capitol, the seat of the US Congress. 
After the meeting, the delegation visited the Library of Congress. With over 155 million media, including 31 million books in 470 languages, this is the second-largest library in the world. 
Gabriel said that the Declaration of Independence had established values – life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, certain inalienable rights of all people – that also played an important role today. 
He then held talks at the US Department of State with his counterpart Rex Tillerson, who had been sworn in only the previous evening. 
In his meeting with Rex Tillerson, it had become clear that the new US Administration was interested in expanding transatlantic relations.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attempted attack in Paris 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (3 February) on the margins of his visit to the US: 
I have just heard the news of the attempted attack at the Louvre in Paris. 
We stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with France and will not waver in the joint fight against Islamist extremism and terrorism. 
Our French friends have been the victims of terrorist attacks several times in recent months. 
We are very happy that no damage could be done, as the French security forces responded so quickly. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, has issued the following statement to mark the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation on 6 February 2017: 
Female genital mutilation is a serious human rights violation. 
“Even in Germany, girls are at risk of having their genitalia mutilated either secretly in this country or abroad. 
All that remains is a sewn-up wound with a small opening for bodily fluids: 
many women and girls bleed to death during this barbarous procedure or die later from tetanus or during childbirth. 
The victims are subjected to pain and suffering all their lives. 
To save future generations from this suffering, we have to work in the countries concerned, as well as in Germany, to end this misogynous and illegal practice. 
The World Health Organization estimates that 200 million women and girls around the world have been the victims of female genital mutilation; every year around three million young girls are cut. 
It is illegal in many countries around the world, in Europe and in Germany. 
under section 226a of the German Criminal Code, the mutilation of the outer genitalia of a female person carries a penalty of imprisonment of not less than one year. 
They are often small girls whose external genitalia are partially or totally removed with knives or shards of glass without any kind of anaesthetic, thus exposing them to unbearable pain. 
We will only succeed by protecting women and girls at risk and, at the same time, by encouraging and helping parents, doctors and the guardians of tradition, for example dignitaries and the authorities, to break down traditional structures and to combat the practice of genital mutilation.” 
German penal law provides for comprehensive protection: 
This also applies to offences committed abroad, regardless of the law in the country in question, if the perpetrator is German or if the crime was committed against a person whose place of residence or habitual abode was in Germany at the time of the offence. 
It not only violates the right to physical and mental integrity; it is a misogynous practice, which serves to control and degrade women and girls. 
The practice is banned under a number of international human rights conventions and United Nations resolutions.

Furthermore, the German Foreign Minister met the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini. 
In Brussels on Monday morning, Foreign Minister Gabriel had the following to say with regard to recent developments in eastern Ukraine prior to the EU Foreign Affairs Council: 
“We are very concerned that the ceasefire is being broken in the region to an increasing degree.” 
The EU is playing an important role both with regard to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and as far as the country’s domestic development is concerned. 
The German Foreign Minister also touched on the situation in eastern Ukraine in talks with his American dialogue partners during his trip to the US last week. 
The European Union is Ukraine’s most important partner in its efforts to implement reforms and modernise administration. 
Prior to the EU Foreign Affairs Council, Foreign Minister Gabriel met Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans for 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his European counterparts at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday (6 February). 
The situation had continued to deteriorate last week with 
hostilities in eastern Ukraine more intense than they had been for a long time. 
Ukraine was by far not the only topic to be addressed by the EU Foreign Ministers today, however. 
Gabriel and his counterparts also discussed relations between the EU and Egypt, as well as the status quo of the Middle East Peace Process – both of which are important policy areas for Europe in which the EU is assuming a central role.

In addition, Gabriel met the Ukrainian President Poroshenko in Berlin. 
The focus of this meeting was on developments in Ukraine and Libya. 
Joint Statement by the Foreign Ministers 
This united Europe that also includes the internal market is the basis for our future. 
We are engaged in an intensive, broad-based and – where necessary – critical dialogue 
One prime example is the only German-language university in Europe outside German-speaking countries, the Andrássy Universität Budapest. 
With the German-Hungarian Forum which has been held annually since 1991, we also have a very special instrument for dialogue covering issues from the spheres of politics, business, culture and the media.

Gabriel’s next stop was New York: 
Twenty-fifth anniversary of the friendship treaty between Germany and Hungary: 
Joint Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó (6 February 2017): 
"Twenty-five years ago to the day, the government representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary signed the Agreement on Friendly Cooperation and Partnership in Europe in Budapest. 
At the White House, he met with Vice President Mike Pence and, at the State Department, with his counterpart Rex Tillerson, who had been sworn in just prior to the visit. 
It was a natural progression following an unprecedented peaceful revolution which began with courageous steps such as the opening of the border between Hungary and Austria for citizens of the GDR in 1989, thus taking the first stone out of the Berlin Wall and paving the way for the unification of Germany and Europe. 
To this day, the Agreement forms the cornerstone of our bilateral relations. 
Germany and Hungary are now close partners in the European Union and in NATO. 
The goals and obligations formulated at the time have retained their validity. 
at the United Nations, he met with the new UN Secretary-General António Guterres and re-emphasised Germany’s support for the United Nations. 
We share responsibility for the European unification project, which is currently facing many threats, as well as for defending the fundamental values anchored therein. 
in which our parliaments, governments as well as the Länder and regions all take part. 
It states that all men are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel examines the German translation of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. 
The German minority in Hungary and its members, who were driven out of Hungary after World War Two and denaturalised and who, with a view to promoting reconciliation, now have their own day of remembrance in Hungary, serve as an additional, important link. 
German-Hungarian relations are deep-rooted and multi-faceted. 
On this basis, we want to keep working both bilaterally and in the European and international context to maintain and deepen the European Union as a community of shared values and a peaceful order for the future and for coming generations." 
Our common goal is to guarantee prosperity, security and cohesion in Europe, to protect minorities and to bolster competitiveness and economic growth . 
We reaffirm that back then and today we attach the utmost importance to the goal of European unity on the basis of human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law and that we will continue to do all we can to further the cohesion of a European Union in which borders are overcome and we strengthen what we share. 
But also apart from official contacts, there is a broad network of civil society and interpersonal connections which breathe life into our bilateral relations. 
It is on the basis of these values that close transatlantic ties are to be maintained. 
Gabriel’s visit was meant to underscore this. It was the first visit by a European foreign minister to the new U.S. administration. 
“These were very good talks. They showed us that there are members of the new administration, too, that are very much interested in expanding and preserving transatlantic ties – not only with Germany, but also with the European Union and with NATO.”

Arnold Bode made his home city of Kassel famous around the world. 
Were it not for his enthusiasm, then the most important exhibition for contemporary art, the documenta, which takes place in Kassel every five years, would not exist. 
I am therefore particularly delighted that the documenta is being made known to a wider audience in China thanks to the exhibition on Arnold Bode’s eventful life and work. 
Visit to the Republic of Latvia 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement in Berlin today (7 February) on the adoption of the bill on the retroactive legalisation of outposts: 
After initial talks and a tour of Riga Castle, the Heads of State will continue their discussions during a joint luncheon. 
It remains a fundamental tenet of our Middle East policy. 
We hope and expect that the Israeli Government will renew its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution and underpin this with practical steps, as called for by the Middle East Quartet. 
The German Government on the bill legalising outposts which was passed in the Knesset yesterday 
The confidence we had in the Israeli Government’s commitment to the two-state solution has been profoundly shaken. 
In view of the many reservations which the Israeli Attorney General, among others, has affirmed once more, it would be good if the bill could soon undergo a critical legal review. 
Many people in Germany who stand firmly by Israel’s side in a spirit of heartfelt solidarity are disappointed by this turn of events. 
The purpose of the bill passed by the Knesset yesterday is to retroactively legalise the numerous outposts on private Palestinian land in the occupied territories which were hitherto regarded as illegal even by Israel. 
Only a negotiated two-state solution can bring durable peace and is in Israel’s interest. 
This will be followed by a press conference. 
It will henceforth be called “Reformation Square”.

Folge Nahrungsmittel… 
The impact of food insecurity in Yemen is critical. 
Yemen has the world's third highest level of malnourishment which according to OCHA manifests itself in 12% of the population suffering from malnutrition. 
Lebensmittelverteilung 
Food distribution as part of a DRK project for internally displaced families in the town of Taiz (Yemen) 
The most pressing needs of the Yemeni population are food, healthcare, reliable access to clean drinking water, sanitary facilities as well as protective measures. 
Restricted access, attacks on humanitarian aid workers and administrative hurdles make it more difficult for the aid which is so urgently needed to get through. 
Alongside providing for the people's most pressing needs, a further focus is on the coordinated efforts of the United Nations to uphold international humanitarian law and to prevent further human rights violations. 
Germany’s humanitarian aid 
Alleinerziehende Frauen… 
Single mothers and their children suffer particularly from the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 
The Federal Foreign Office has been providing humanitarian assistance since before the acute humanitarian crisis began in Yemen, contributing to international and cross-sectoral aid projects run by the United Nations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and German NGOs. 
The Humanitarian Response Plan coordinated and prioritised by the United Nations provides the framework here. 
The strategic priorities of Germany's humanitarian assistance in Yemen are in line with need and focus primarily on areas with the highest vulnerability assessment. 
Also in 2017, humanitarian assistance for the people in Yemen will continue to be a priority of German foreign policy. 
The situation in Yemen represents one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world. 
Some 18.8 million people are directly affected by the consequences of armed conflict and food insecurity and they often lack access to even elementary healthcare. 
The difficulties in Yemen, a country characterised by extreme poverty, natural disasters and internal conflict, have been further exacerbated since March 2015 by ongoing struggles and bombardments and the resulting humanitarian consequences, making it one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world. 
Given the lack of media presence and public awareness resulting in a shoartage of donations, only a fraction of the humanitarian need can actually be covered. 
Humanitarian need in Yemen© 
Of Yemen's 27.4 million inhabitants, more than half require humanitarian assistance. 
18.8 million people, of which 10.3 million are children, are affected by food insecurity, a lack of access to elementary healthcare and the direct impact of armed conflict. 
Food insecurity creates a critical situation. 
The consequences of this malnourishment and the resulting susceptibility to epidemics are further exacerbated by the lack of access to healthcare, clean drinking water and sanitary facilities. 
In early 2017, cholera outbreaks have been reported in 15 governorates. 
UNICEF reports that a child dies of preventable disease every ten minutes make plain just how disastrous the humanitarian situation is. 
Above all, the 2.2 million internally displaced persons most of whom live in precarious conditions are in severe need of humanitarian assistance, also given the harsh weather conditions. 
Violations of international humanitarian law hamper the provision of the humanitarian aid that is required. 
In 2016, the Federal Foreign Office significantly increased humanitarian assistance for Yemen and made available some 33.3 million euros for humanitarian aid measures. 
Furthermore, 1.4 million euros have been used for crisis management as part of the support we provide for political processes. 
Syrian Heritage Archive Project 
Syria is one of the world’s important cultural landscapes. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement in Berlin today (8 February): 
The textile sector in Bangladesh, where striking workers and trade unionists still remain in prison following strikes in December, shows the need to improve standards. 
We are increasingly concerned about whether these people will be granted a fair trial in line with the rule of law. 
In recent years, Bangladesh has established an internationally competitive textile sector, thus achieving considerable economic success. 
but further improvements are needed as regards occupational health and safety and conditions in factories. 
There is still no legal basis for founding effective trade unions. 
We thus support the dialogue between workers, employers and the government on improving social and environmental standards. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the implementation of the National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights and on the situation in Bangladesh 
Foreign Minister Gabriel welcomes this implementation of a point in the coalition agreement that is also important to him personally. 
Progress has been made since the terrible disaster in the Rana Plaza factory in 2013, 
We call on the responsibility of German companies to uphold human rights along the entire production and supply chain. 
We also call on the responsibility of the state and the business sector in Bangladesh to agree further steps on improving workers’ situation. 
The European Court of Human Rights described the 2013 conviction as politically motivated and criticised the arbitrary interpretation of Russia’s penal laws. 
Help for people in need: 
Germany doubled its humanitarian engagement in Africa in 2016 
In 2016 more than 65 million people around the world fled from crises, violence and natural disasters. 
Africa is a particular focus of Germany’s humanitarian assistance. 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson on the conviction of Alexei Navalny 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (8 February) on the conviction of Alexei Navalny, a leading opposition figure in Russia: 
Never before have so many people had to flee their homes as in 2016: more than 65 million refugees and internally displaced persons around the world fled from crises, violence and natural disasters. 
Africa is a particular focus of Germany’s humanitarian assistance, alongside the huge humanitarian crisis in Syria and its neighbouring countries. 
In large parts of Africa, people are fighting for their day-to-day survival. 
The situation in many crisis regions on the continent has worsened: existing conflicts are escalating, new ones are flaring up, and there are continuing climate-related natural disasters. 
At the same time, the aid programmes for the crisis regions in Africa coordinated by the United Nations are underfunded. 
The number of crisis regions in Africa is increasing 
Bild: Supplies for children and families in Timbuktu 
The Federal Foreign Office is highly committed to the mandate to put the National Action Plan into practice now and to enhance human rights standards. 
There was an unexpectedly high increase in the duration and scope of humanitarian crises in 2016, 
However, this success must not be achieved at the expense of the people who make it possible, namely the workers in the textile factories. 
A unit has been set up in the Federal Foreign Office to implement the National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights. 
Alexei Navalny must have the opportunity to remain politically active in Russia. 
In this connection, the German Government reminds Russia of its obligation to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. 
particularly in the case of the complex crises in Libya, the Horn of Africa (especially Somalia and Ethiopia), Sudan and South Sudan, the Central African Republic, the DR Congo, Burundi, Mali, Niger and the Lake Chad Basin. 
Several of these conflicts are impacting on neighbouring countries. 
The greatest areas of need are food supplies, health and nutrition, improved water supplies, sanitation and hygiene, and the provision of shelters. 
These are therefore the focal points of the Federal Foreign Office’s humanitarian assistance. 
How Germany provides humanitarian assistance in Africa 
Developing health structures...Nairobi slums 
With regard to these proceedings, too, doubts remain as to whether the right to a fair trial in line with the European Convention on Human Rights was ensured. 
Humanitarian assistance helps people affected by conflicts and disasters in Africa to secure their survival and build up a livelihood near their original homes. 
With these goals in mind, the Federal Foreign Office dovetails its humanitarian assistance with stabilisation and conflict prevention measures, so as to offer the people possibilities for development in the medium term. 
Humanitarian protection is a priority particularly in areas affected by armed conflict. 
It is also important to provide the suffering population with food and other goods, and to ensure the provision of drinking water. 
Other urgent priorities include the provision of medical care and the treatment of acute cases of malnutrition. 
Projects to help refugees or internally displaced persons usually also include elements for the host communities, in a bid to foster peaceful coexistence despite the scarcity of resources. 
Urging further engagement 
We are concerned by the news that the five-year suspended sentence handed down to the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2013 was confirmed today.

The concrete project work operates through bilateral working groups which include businesses and research institutes. 
As a result, sustainable energy supplies are to be created in the partner country while making a contribution to climate protection. 
At the same time, the energy partnerships play a role in creating market-economy conditions and shaping open markets. 
They open up export opportunities for German businesses and help further the use of innovative technologies. 
By reducing global competition for energy resources, which are becoming more scarce, the energy partnerships also increase Germany's security of supply in the long term. 
Germany has energy partnerships with 
While the political direction of cooperation is the responsibility of a high-level steering group, practical cooperation is conducted within formalised committee structures. 
The countries of sub‑Saharan Africa are currently sheltering the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in the world. 
Schoolchildren and their families are provided with drinking water and hygiene products in the war-torn Timbuktu region (Mali) 
The Federal Foreign Office works closely together on humanitarian projects with partners from UN organisations (e.g. World Food Programme, UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and many non-governmental organisations on humanitarian projects. 
The Federal Foreign Office will continue its humanitarian engagement in Africa’s crisis regions this year in order to make it possible for people to survive in dignity and safety. 
As co-host of the Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region being held in Oslo on 24 February 2017, Germany will continue to urge others to provide political and financial support for humanitarian assistance in the crisis region. 
In view of growing global energy needs and Germany’s high dependence on energy imports, the German Government has entered into a number of bilateral energy partnerships in recent years with countries that are important in terms of energy production, transit or consumption. 
The energy partnerships are based on a joint declaration of intent or on a bilateral agreement signed at a high political level. 
The primary goal of the energy partnerships is to support the partner country, as regards expanding renewable energies, promoting energy efficiency and the use of modern energy technologies. 
We condemn the attack on aid workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross in northern Afghanistan in no uncertain terms. 
Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims. 
There can be no justification for this violence. 
They are offering the Afghan people great assistance under the most difficult of circumstances. 
This is the responsibility of the perpetrators who carry out such perfidious crimes. 
The understandable decision taken by the International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend its work in Afghanistan will not make civilian reconstruction and humanitarian support for the people in the country any easier for the international community. 
We would like to offer the International Committee of the Red Cross our most sincere condolences in a spirit of solidarity. 
These humanitarian aid workers are in the country in order to help supply the people in Afghanistan with basic essentials during the cold winter months. 
The fact that they are being turned into targets is a reflection of the terrorists’ inhuman mindset. 
The Cultural Preservation Programme funds restoration and conservation work at the famous temple city – a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992 – and trains restorers and conservators 
“My name is Raphaela Klein and I’ve worked on the German Apsara Conservation Project since 2012. 
The GACP is headed by Professor Hans Leisen and aims to preserve temples in Cambodia, above all Angkor Wat. 
One such project seeks to preserve the temple complex in Angkor 
The practical work is done by a team of Khmer restorers, trained on the project. 
The project was launched in 1995 and has since focused on preventing the deterioration of this great temple. 
The project also provided material for my Masters thesis. 
To this end, the United Nations General Assembly established a standing committee (COPUOS) in 1959, which it tasked with drawing up a system of international laws for outer space. 
It lays down principles governing countries’ activities in outer space. 
A set of principles aimed at protecting the environment was similarly adopted in a UN resolution in 1992. 
It concerns the use of nuclear power sources (NPS) in outer space and above all lays down rules on security requirements, avoidance and notification obligations (see below). 
This ensures that developing countries, which currently account for the majority of the Committee’s current membership of 84 member states, cannot outvote the minority of states engaged in space travel, but also results in lengthy negotiations if the political pressure to reach agreement is not strong enough. 
An issue that is fast increasing in practical importance is that of space debris. 
These could seriously hamper space travel and astronomical research in the future. 
Germany is represented regularly at international conferences on space travel: the Federal Government participates in European Space Agency (ESA) conferences and communicates the German position with regard to space law at COPUOS conferences. 
Germany is working on its own outer space law so that it can define the norms for national accountability and liability. 
The focus of my Masters was on the development and implementation of a conservation concept for the decorative elements which were at imminent risk. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel condemns rocket attack on Israeli city of Eilat 
I condemn the rocket attack on the Israeli beach resort Eilat in the strongest terms. 
It’s been great fun working on this project. 
Yesterday, for example, I said goodbye to my team, because I’m flying to Germany again soon. 
Again, our Israeli friends were the target of a terrorist attack. 
The varied ornamental and figurative designs in lime mortar and the remaining lime plasterwork are at grave risk, primarily because of existing cavities, cracks and networks of cracks. 
All the stucco decoration in the west-north tower has now been completely conserved, and I have been able to review my conservation concept for viability at other brick temples, at Preah Koh, Trapeang Phong and Koh Ker. Partial areas of stucco decoration at those sites have been conserved.

There is nothing to justify this.

Research and academic relations policy - objectives 
Bild: Logo 
In a globalised knowledge-based society in which education and know-how are universally available and instantly accessible, international networking is essential if Germany is to remain a prime location for science and research. 
It is the prerequisite for increased knowledge and technological progress, as well as for growth and prosperity in Germany. 
International exchange is also an excellent way to seek joint solutions to global challenges, such as climate change, energy security and terrorism. 
International law of the sea 
Entry into force 
Research and academic relations policy has an important role to play, particularly in an age when new conflicts in Europe’s vicinity and beyond are altering the environment, because its aim is twofold: to advance our general foreign policy goals and to promote Germany as a prime research and business location. 
It is important for Germany, with its high-tech industries, to be integrated into global knowledge flows and value added chains. 
Scientific excellence feeds on exchange and on competition between the world’s best. 
Research and academic relations policy therefore takes measures to further consolidate Germany’s position as an internationally attractive location for study and research. 
By training future elites in partner countries, education and research can make a contribution to crisis prevention and crisis management, as well as to transition efforts. 
and is thus a key element of our cultural relations and education policy. 
Germany has become an increasingly popular choice with foreign students over the past few years. 
In 2015, there were 321,569 foreign students enrolled at German universities, 
Negotiating history 
I worked on the documentation, analysis and conservation of the stucco decoration at Bakong temple. 
In 2015 the largest number of these foreign students came from China (30,000), 
followed by India and Russia ahead of Austria, France and Italy. 
In comparison with German students a relatively large number of foreign students opt to study engineering subjects. 
The number of academics working in Germany is also on the rise. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (9 February) concerning attack on the Israeli city of Eilat yesterday: 
We are relieved that the terrorists' plan did not come to fruition thanks to the effective Israeli security precautions in place, and that nobody was harmed in the attack. 
The Convention 
There was a strong increase in numbers from Iran (+17 percent) and India (+11 percent) in comparison with the previous year. 
However, the attempt alone is proof of the disrespect for human life of those behind such a terrorist act, who try to fuel tension with all means at their disposal. 
Compared with their German colleagues, a relatively large number of these foreign researchers come from the fields of mathematics, the sciences, engineering, medicine and health sciences. 
We stand firm as close friends at Israel's side, for whose security we bear special responsibility. 
Some 280 German universities operate over 20,000 international cooperation arrangements with around 4100 partner institutions in 141 countries. 
What does research and academic relations policy mean in practice? 
Basically, the most important features of research and academic relations policy are these:

Transnational education projects comprise everything from binational courses to centres of excellence and the establishment of comprehensive binational universities. 
German universities are involved in 261 transnational education project courses worldwide, with a total of 28,500 students. 
One focus of the Federal Foreign Office’s activities is the further development of proven measures such as the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Centres of Excellence for Research and Teaching and Centres of African Excellence. 
One outstanding example of a transnational education project is the German-Jordanian University, where the curriculum includes an obligatory year in Germany. 
The Federal Foreign Office is supporting this project within the framework of its Cultural Preservation Programme. 
High cultures shaped the country over the course of millennia.

The composition of the Tribunal must reflect the principal legal systems of the world and assure an equitable geographical distribution. 
The first judges were elected by the States Parties in New York on 1 August 1996. 
Among them was the German international jurist Professor Rüdiger Wolfrum, who went on to be re-elected in 1999 (until 2008) and 2008 (until 2017). 
Professor Wolfrum served as President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea from 2005 to 2008. 
On 21 August 1981, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea chose Hamburg as the future seat of the International Tribunal. 
Article 1 (2) of Annex VI of the Convention on the Law of the Sea thus reads:

The humanitarian disaster caused by the civil war in Syria often drowns out the fact that the country is one of the world’s most impressive cultural landscapes in terms of the number and historical significance of its monuments. 
Known activists like Gamal Eid and Hossam Bahgat were banned from leaving the country, and their bank accounts were likewise frozen. 
The trail of destruction in Syria’s old towns, as well as systematic illicit excavations at important archaeological sites, testify to a dynamic that has the potential to result in the irretrievable loss of the country’s most important historical witnesses. 
The project is working to establish a digital register of Syrian cultural objects by creating a digital catalogue of these archives. 
It seeks to safeguard these important archives of knowledge on Syria’s archaeological sites and historical monuments in the long term and to use this wealth of information to support the preservation of culture. 
The closure on 9 February of the Nadeem Center, which provided medical assistance for victims of torture and domestic violence, is part of this pattern. 
It is being organised by the Goethe-Institut Gulf Region, the German Embassy in Doha and the Embassy of Qatar in Germany. 
“The ever greater curtailment of civil society engagement in Egypt fills me with great concern. 
Premises of the Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence in Cairo were sealed by the authorities on 9 February. 
The Nadeem Center is an independent Egyptian NGO which campaigns against torture and provides medical assistance for torture victims and victims of physical violence. 
Human rights activists and organisations in Egypt are currently being subjected to an unprecedented level of investigation. 
In 2016, the bank accounts of organisations such as the Nadeem Center, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies and the NGO Nazra for Feminist Studies were frozen. 
The Egyptian anti-terror law provides for harsh penalties, including life imprisonment, for acts that “harm national interests or endanger social peace or the independence or unity of Egypt” and lays down strict conditions for NGOs’ work in the international sphere and for accepting funding from abroad. 
The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation’s support for excellent scientists from all over the world plays an essential role in this regard. 
It enables outstanding scientists to realise a research project as one of over 27,000 Humboldt Foundation alumni around the world. 
Germany’s research and academic relations policy does not merely focus on expanding its international network, but also on traditional binational institutions. 
For instance, the Fulbright Commission is one of the most important partners in cultural relations and education policy between Germany and the United States. 
Ever since the German-American Fulbright Agreement was signed in 1952, the programme has been tremendously successful in promoting mutual understanding between the United States and Germany through academic and cultural exchanges involving highly-qualified students, teachers and scientists who show great commitment to intercultural understanding and strong social engagement. 
Commitment to integration and crisis prevention 
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS) entered into force on 16 November 1994, supplemented by an Agreement of 28 July 1994 on the implementation of the provisions on seabed mining. 
As of 1 February 2017, UNCLOS had acquired a total of 168 States Parties (including the EU), and the Implementing Agreement a total of 150 States Parties. 
The Agreement relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks of 4 August 1995 entered into force on 11 December 2001. Germany acceded to this Agreement on 19 December 2003 together with all other EU states. 
Most Western industrialised nations initially rejected the Convention because of the provisions on seabed mining contained in Part XI, in particular the rules on taxes, customs duties and mining restrictions, as well as technology transfers and decision-making processes within the International Seabed Authority. 
An informal consultation process under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General eventually resulted in a modification of Part XI of the Convention, in the form of the Implementing Agreement of 28 July 1994. 
This paved the way for universal acceptance of UNCLOS. 
For 25 years now, the Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative (DAFI), sponsored by the Federal Foreign Office in cooperation with UNHCR, has enabled refugees to study at university in a third state. 
The German statute to implement the UNCLOS regime (Act Implementing the Convention of the Law of the Sea 1982/94), which provides for the necessary adaptation of domestic law, entered into force on 15 June 1995. 
On the basis of the Convention, the Federal Republic of Germany extended the breadth of its territorial sea to a maximum of 12 nautical miles as of 1 January 1995 and proclaimed the establishment of an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North and Baltic Seas. 
Protecting scientists who are in jeopardy is a particular priority. 
In collaboration with the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Federal Foreign Office has launched the “Philipp Schwartz Initiative” (PSI) for persecuted scientists. 
In May 2016, 23 researchers were chosen to receive a two-year scholarship. They have now begun work. Another 46 scientists will receive a PSI grant from January 2017. 
Of these 69, 32 come from Syria and 27 from Turkey. 
There are three from Iraq and one each from Libya, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Sudan, Burundi and Tajikistan. 
A third lot of grants for around 25 scientists in danger from war and persecution will be advertised in 2017.

The Syrian Heritage Archive Project helps to preserve Syrian cultural objects through their digital registration. 
The Syrian Heritage Archive Project (SHAP), conducted by the German Archaeological Institute and the Museum of Islamic Art, seeks to preserve research data on Syrian cultural objects in the long term and creates scope for future work in the area of cultural preservation.

Owing to current developments in the country, the existence of this outstanding long-term archive, much of which has yet to be fully researched, is severely threatened. 
They administrate extensive databases for many of Syria’s most significant archaeological and historical sites, as well as historical photographs from the period prior to the First World War and important private material that belonged to researchers. 
Since 2013, work has been under way in five project phases so far to integrate extensive analogue data of both institutions into the research environment of the German Archaeological Institute (iDAI.welt) and to administrate it in detail and prepare it for future use in the field of cultural preservation (e.g. damage mapping and reconstruction planning). 
The interfaces of the IT systems used facilitate international networks with other, similar projects seeking to document Syrian cultural heritage, an aim pursued from the outset, in order to establish as comprehensive a collection of data as possible and to provide firm foundations for monitoring activities and measures to protect cultural objects. 
The work done by SHAP is part of a wider network to preserve culture in today’s crisis regions known as Stunde Null: A Future after the Crisis, which focuses on basic and further training in the arena of cultural heritage. 
A Future after the Crisis 
Federal Government condemns North Korean missile test 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (12 February) in response to North Korea’s launch of a ballistic missile: 
I condemn the recent ballistic missile launch in the strongest possible terms. 
We stand firmly at the side of our partners, with whom we will closely coordinate all further measures. 
We urgently call on North Korea to see reason and to fully abide by all UN Security Council Resolutions. 
In 2017, North Korea is continuing to violate international law. 
With this provocative action, which is in violation of the Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, North Korea is moving towards even greater international isolation. 
Space law

The Outer Space Treaty also provides for liability for damage as a result of outer space activities (Article VII). 
* the Rescue Agreement of 1968 on lending assistance to astronauts in emergencies and the return of objects launched into outer space 
* the Registration Convention of 1975 on facilitating the identification of objects launched into outer space 
Adopted by the General Assembly in 1996 after nearly ten years of negotiations, it emphasises a country’s freedom to use outer space and choose its cooperation partners. 
The following are among the topics currently on the Legal Committee’s agenda: utilisation of the geostationary orbit (GSO); delimitation of outer space against air space; and the procedure used by states and international organisations for registering space objects. 
It concerns the removal or reduction of the risk of collisions in outer space and crashes to Earth (e.g. Cosmos 954) caused by the growing number of space objects that have broken down or broken apart (e.g. satellites, missile components). 
Development and status of space law 
The first uses of outer space, beginning with the satellite launches by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1957/1958, prompted a swift response from the international community in terms of developing space law. 
Outer Space Treaty 
The border between air space and outer space itself is not defined. 
However, they are of little practical importance in their current form. 
Supplementary treaties 
The technical developments in space travel and the risks it involves have led to the elaboration of agreements aimed at supplementing and lending substance to the Outer Space Treaty. 
So far, only 15 countries have ratified this Agreement. 
Sets of principles 
The Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Space that were finally adopted in a UN resolution in 1986 confirm the unrestricted right to remote sensing without prior consent or notification. 
The set of principles laid down in the Space Benefits Resolution deals with international cooperation in outer space. 
There is no provision for the compulsory transfer of resources and technology as demanded for some time by developing countries. 
All three committees meet annually. 
All treaties and sets of principles to date have been drawn up and negotiated in the Legal Subcommittee, 
the main forum for developing space law. 
COPUOS makes its decisions on the basis of consensus. 
Satellites with nuclear power sources on board that crash to Earth pose particular dangers. 
The Scientific and Technical Subcommittee is currently addressing this issue, while the Legal Subcommittee is exploring the legal issues.

What do you hope to achieve with the film and the overall project? 
The film “Guzo North” enables viewers to see the tradition very clearly. 
What role did the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office play in the project? 
The support provided by the Federal Foreign Office to this project in Ethiopia was very important, as the country itself had not yet made a documentary on these old traditions. 
Our project had a great impact on the country. 
We very much hope that there will be further films from other regions in Ethiopia because the project has not been completed with this first film. 
Naturally, we will continue working and liaising very closely with Ethiopia.” 
Appeal to the German people: Be brave! 
In his acceptance speech, the 61-year-old new head of state made the following demand:

The idea behind it is that this is amazing intangible cultural heritage. 
including the documentation, “Guzo”, about the roots of Ethiopian music. 
“Let us be courageous – then I won’t be afraid of the future!” He called on his fellow Germans to look to the future with confidence and to valiantly preserve the country’s achievements: 
“We made a documentary about the Timkat Festival in northern Ethiopia – the Ethiopian feast of the Epiphany and the most important and largest festival of its kind in the country. 
This feast day dates back to the sixth century in our calendar. It is striking how very old Christian customs are observed here – but always in direct contact and interaction with Islam and in particular with Judaism. 
“During these times marked by change and upheaval, when so many certainties and foregone conclusions have been wiped aside, Frank-Walter Steinmeier is the right choice,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said. 
The film turned out extremely well. And it is the first of its kind, including in Ethiopia. 
That is our goal – and that is also why we worked directly with the institutions and academic institutes, but also with the performers and participants.”

which enabled us to look very deeply into this culture.” 
Our aim is also to support cultural policy in Ethiopia so that this tradition will hopefully be added soon to UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. 
Apart from me, our academic team included two Ethiopian academics, Timkehet Teffera and Getie Gelaye, both of whom hold doctorates in cultural and music studies. They were there when we made the film, 
By winning an absolute majority, he met the requirement set out in the Basic Law already in the first round and was thereby elected to the country’s highest office. 
Elected Federal President in the first round of voting 
On 19 March 2017, Steinmeier will take up his official duties, after having been sworn in during a joint session of the Bundestag and Bundesrat. 
“We need a Federal President who builds confidence and self-assurance, especially one who can bring people together and keep our country united.” He went on to say that Steinmeier is a man of the people and is greatly respected around the world. 
Prior to the vote, Foreign Minister Gabriel had expressed the hope that his predecessor Steinmeier would receive a “clear majority of votes, across all party lines”.

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the signing of the framework agreement on an untied loan to support Iraq 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (13 February) on the signing of the framework agreement on an untied loan to support Iraq: 
The liberation of eastern Mosul by Iraqi security forces is a significant success. 
Tens of thousands have already returned to the suburbs and the liberated areas of the city. 
The new Head of State, who is 61 years old, said in his acceptance speech, “Let us be courageous, then I won’t be afraid of the future!” 
Steinmeier received 931 of the 1,239 valid votes that were cast during the first round. 
With this result of the first round of voting, he won the absolute majority required under the Basic Law, Germany’s constitution, for the highest office in the country. 
In a Federal Convention election held in Berlin on 12 February 2017, former German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected the 12th President of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
That is the focus of our engagement. 
IS cannot be conquered by military means alone. 
Extremism and terrorism will only be deprived of their breeding ground if the people in the areas liberated from IS can envisage a positive future for themselves and their families. 
A red carpet at the Berlinale 
That is a Herculean task, but it is also strengthening the Iraqi communities, helping to pave the way for a peaceful future and tackling the root causes of displacement. 
In order that these cities and areas can soon become peaceful, vibrant and pleasant places to live once again, even more engagement and investment is needed: in a functioning water and energy supply and a working transport system. 
In other Iraqi towns too, such as Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah, international stabilisation measures have enabled many families to go back home. 
Cultural preservation – video on Iran 
One such project is the preservation of the Takht-e Soleyman in Iran

“Our partner, film‑maker Dirk van den Berg, met the great Ethiopian jazz pianist, Sammy Yirga. This led to the idea of doing something that had not been done before, that is, of making a documentary film on this rich musical culture and looking for inspiration from it, including for artistic projects. 
Which part of the site means the most to you? 
We were asked to help and have received financial backing from the Federal Foreign Office for the first time this year. Naturally, the Iranian side has to contribute a sizeable share, that’s to say provide workers on site, make available and maintain accommodation, transport and equipment and similar things.

they recharged their batteries there and built up their courage and self-confidence before going to war to defend their own country or conquer others.” 
Of course, it also helps to ensure that people stay in Iran, love their country and continue to build it.” 
“Archaeologists have not been allowed to work there since the Iranian Revolution and the excavated components have been crumbling since then. 
Helping African film culture extend its international reach is an important way of promoting intercultural dialogue. 
We want to assist the Iraqi Government in restoring public infrastructure to enable those who were forced to flee from IS terrorism to return home. 
In this way, the World Cinema Fund, which receives Federal Foreign Office funding, creates a more diverse film culture – around the world and in German cinemas. 
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, Hamburg (ITLOS) 
The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is based in Hamburg and was established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS, entered into force on 16 November 1994). 
The Tribunal comprises 21 judges 
The Statute of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea forms Annex VI of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
Judgments 
Important judgments were handed down in February 2011 in the form of an Advisory Opinion on environmental and liability standards with respect to activities on the seabed (case 17), in March 2012 a judgment regarding the dispute concerning delimitation of the maritime border between Bangladesh and Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal (case 16), in November 2013 in the form of an Order to release the Arctic Sunrise in the case of the Kingdom of the Netherlands v. the Russian Federation (case 22) and in April 2015 in the form of an Advisory Opinion in which the ITLOS reaffirmed its jurisdiction to issue the Advisory Opinion requested (case 21)

The aim of Africa Hub, which is a new European Film Market platform and receives funding from the Federal Foreign Office, is to connect African filmmakers with German producers. 
It also prohibits nuclear tests and the disposal of radioactive waste in Antarctica. 
Making sure that unusual images are seen and moving stories heard from regions without much infrastructure for film and cinema, 
Funding goes to film production, as well as to distribution so that films can be screened in Germany. 
Germany has not asserted any territorial claims. 
The fund’s focal regions are Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, South-East Asia and the Caucasus. 
In 1991, Germany hosted the 16th ATCM (ATCM XVI) in Bonn. 
Dr Manfred Reinke, a German scientist, has been the Secretariat’s Executive Secretary since 1 September 2009. 
What is the importance of this project to people in Iran? 
“For the local population, this site is part of their identity and thousands of Iranians go on a pilgrimage to see it every year. 
The aim is to secure the western iwan of the World Heritage site Takht-e Soleyman and to ensure its long-term protection. 
I believe this is why the site remains important to them to this very day. 
Scientists are also monitoring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica. 
Another increasingly important use of Antarctica is for tourism. 
While this is generally in the form of excursions by small groups from cruise liners, it is nevertheless having a growing impact on the work of the research stations as well as the Antarctic environment. 
At the 1994 ATCM in Kyoto, the Consultative Parties decided that Antarctic visitors and tour operators should follow strict rules of conduct and other requirements (Guidelines for Tourism) designed to afford maximum protection to animal life, the environment and scientific research in Antarctica. 
“The western iwan, which is not so easy to recognise now, which rises like a tooth into the skyline. At present it’s supported on the eastern side by tubular scaffolding which, however, is somewhat battered. 
The Iranian side has taken measures to address this decay and the climatic conditions but they haven’t yet found a coherent strategy or solution. 
This year, the Federal Foreign Office contribution is being used to develop the technology there and then train Iranians so that they can carry out the work themselves in future.” 
The 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) plays an important role in protecting the Antarctic ecosystem.

It will enter into force when all the Consultative Parties have implemented it in their countries, a process which ought to be completed in the next few years. The Antarctic Treaty System also comprises the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) of 1972 and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) of 1980. 
The 300 selected individuals take part in a six‑day programme that incorporates discussions, workshops and networking events. 
the World Cinema Fund provides funding for films that might never be made without such support. 
Every year, more than 400,000 visitors brave Berlin’s cold February weather to stand in line at ticket booths so they can see documentaries from Myanmar, Indian thrillers or Scandinavian short films. 
Africa Hub – 
The image of Africa that is presented in European and American films is often built on many clichés. 
World Cinema Fund – 
“Takht-e Soleyman, which means "Throne of Solomon", is an archaeological ensemble dating back to the Persian Empire, that’s to say between the 3rd and 7th centuries A.D., the remains of which were excavated by German archaeologists in the 1960s and 1970s. 
The site lies 2200 metres above sea level and is exposed to extreme weather conditions: in summer up to 40 C and in winter -20 C with up to a metre and a half of snow. 
Our aim would be to first of all start there and save and secure this crumbling element so that, ultimately, the modern scaffolding can be removed. Then the beauty of these ruins will be seen to their best advantage in the landscape.” 
As part of a European project, for instance, ice core drilling is being used to investigate natural climate change over the past 500,000 years. 
The Consultative Parties have also drawn up a post-visit report form on which tour operators are required to notify any relevant information in this connection to the competent national authority. 
German-Russian cyber-security consultations 
The Russian delegation was headed by Ambassador Andrei Krutskikh, Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation in Information Security. 
Both sides discussed national developments and structures, as well as current issues in international cyber security. 
Combating jihadist internet propaganda was a further topic of the talks. 
Both sides agreed to continue their dialogue. 
A further round of the German-Russian cyber-security consultations was held at working level in Berlin on 9 February 2017. 
Ambassador Thomas Fitschen, Director for the United Nations, International Cyber Policy and Counterterrorism, was head of the interministerial delegation on the German side. 
The agenda also included work on regulations for responsible state conduct in cyberspace and on confidence-building measures (particularly in the OSCE). 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel today (15 February) on the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting 
No country in the world can tackle the major international problems of our time alone. 
Climate change cannot be tackled by barbed wire. 
“Foreign policy is, and must be, more than crisis management. 
We are well advised not to constantly run from one fire to the next, putting out the flames. 
Terrorism, water scarcity, forced migration and humanitarian emergencies cannot be resolved by isolation. 
As the coincidences of international diplomacy would have it, I am not the only one for whom this meeting is a première as Foreign Minister. 
Germany will be a forum for global politics in the coming days. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel inducts new State Secretaries 
With a ceremony in the Weltsaal of the Federal Foreign Office, Foreign Minister Gabriel inducted the new State Secretaries Sontowski and Lindner and bade farewell to outgoing State Secretary Steinlein. 
With a ceremony in the Weltsaal of the Federal Foreign Office on Tuesday (14 February), Foreign Minister Gabriel inducted the new State Secretaries Rainer Sontowski and Walter Lindner. 
Just prior to this, he had discharged outgoing State Secretary Stephan Steinlein from his duties.

He went on to say that this “stone age” had been a “highly productive period”. 
That is why it is so important that the 20 largest countries in the world are meeting to address the causes of conflicts and the options for peaceful crisis prevention and conflict resolution. 
We want to use this opportunity, first in Bonn and then in Munich, to address the major issues on the agenda.“ 
He wished him the best of luck for the performance of his new duties.

He insisted there is no reason to be discouraged. 
Steinlein’s farewell address 
The Foreign Minister’s speech was followed by Steinlein’s farewell address, and it was met by a big round of applause by the staff of the Federal Foreign Office. 
His remarks were fully focused on saying “thank you”. 
He said he will continue to think of the Federal Foreign Office as his home, even though he is now bidding a final farewell and will take up his new duties as State Secretary at the Office of the Federal President. 
The new State Secretaries’ inaugural speeches

In his inaugural speech, the new State Secretary Walter Lindner expressed his appreciation of the trust that has been placed in him. 
State Secretary Sontowski later added he trusts he will benefit from the sensitivity and expert knowledge with which Federal Foreign Office staff perform their duties. 
Finally, he expressed his conviction that the Federal Foreign Office will be further strengthened thanks to the Vice Chancellor responsibilities that have now been added to its portfolio. 
He pointed out that great challenges await Steinlein in his next posting as State Secretary at the Office of the Federal President, where he will continue to work for Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who will be taking office as Federal President. 
Lindner is “always right where the action is” and a true man of the people. 
Lindner’s most recent posting was as Germany’s Ambassador to South Africa. 
Gabriel said he had at various times had the opportunity to see this for himself. 
He said he looks forward to working at the Federal Foreign Office at a time when there are a great number of tasks that need to be tackled. 
“Connecting worlds of knowledge” logo 
The Federal Foreign Office’s research and academic relations policy promotes academic and scientific exchange between Germany and the world. 
Successful international networking brings a direct competitive advantage. 
Academic and scientific exchange has an impact not only across national borders: it also transcends cultural and political divides 
meaning that 11.9 percent of all students at German universities came from abroad. 
It is estimated that there were more than 85,000 foreign researchers working either temporarily or permanently at universities, non-university research institutions and companies in Germany in 2014, with the largest groups coming from China, Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. 
German universities have ties with all regions of the world. 
These courses are beacons of German academic cooperation in partner countries. 
Each of the 4000 or so students spends half of this required year studying at a German partner university, and the other six months doing an internship at a German company. 
In 2008/2009, the Federal Foreign Office and the Alliance of Scientific Organizations in Germany initiated the German Science and Innovation Houses with the aim of strengthening Germany as a location for research, science and innovation. 
The basis for the work of the German Science and Innovation Houses is the Strategy of the Federal Government for the Internationalisation of Science and Research (2008), the Research and Academic Relations Initiative (since 2009) and the “International Cooperation” Action Plan (2014). 
The Science and Innovation Houses in New York, Tokyo, São Paulo, New Delhi and Moscow are showcases of the German academic and scientific organisations. They promote Germany and they also help build up networks between the scientific research community and the business community and provide interested researchers with advice and support. 
These joint, cross-organisational showcases of German scientific and research organisations and of industrial research consolidate Germany’s role and network the crucial players better than any other German institution abroad could do. 
The key to research and academic relations policy is to systematically promote international networks among universities and the scientific and research communities in order to create an innovation-friendly environment. 
In this context, Germany’s missions abroad are very important as portals for Germany. 
With their analyses and reports on developments in research and technology policy in the host country, and with their concrete support for bilateral cooperation arrangements, the help they give experts from Germany and German scientists abroad, and their work to nurture contacts with key actors in the host country, they lay a broad foundation for scientific and technological cooperation worldwide. 
Promoting educational biographies with a German connection is the key. 
The Federal Foreign Office continuously fosters these biographies by supporting everything from school and language education to work by candidates for Nobel Prizes. 
The Leibniz science internships help to intensify the international science and research network. 
The programme, developed by the Federal Foreign Office and the Leibniz Association in 2012, enables senior members of staff of the Leibniz Association to intern at German missions abroad and thus to acquire intercultural competence which will subsequently benefit the national research establishments. 
The continuous development of tried-and-tested measures such as the German Academic Exchange Service’s scholarship and support programme (STIBET) for foreign students at German universities enables foreigners to be effectively integrated into the German education system and scientific and academic structures. 
The aim is to support them in their studies and work and thus to improve the success rate of academic and scientific cooperation. 
Moreover, by providing training and study support for present and future elites from countries in crisis regions, research and academic relations policy plays an important role in crisis prevention and in tackling the causes of refugee flows. 
In 2015, the Federal Foreign Office, together with the German Academic Exchange Service, established the “Leadership for Syria” scholarship programme, which will grant a total of 225 scholarships between 2015 and 2019 to enable qualified Syrian applicants from various disciplines to study at university in Germany. 
This initiative makes it possible for German universities and research institutions to offer places to researchers who are affected by war and at risk of persecution in their own countries. 
Between 2016 and 2018, with help from the Gerda Henkel Foundation, the Krishna temple will be repaired and the collapsed Hari Shankar temple rebuilt. 
Restoration of Patan Royal Palace 
Patan Royal Palace is one of the most important cultural heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The Kathmandu Valley in Nepal boasts no fewer than seven World Heritage sites. 
Following the two earthquakes in April and May 2015, the Federal Foreign Office, which has been committed to the preservation of this cultural heritage site for years, joined with the Gerda Henkel Foundation to launch a joint initiative to rebuild damaged cultural property in Nepal.

Structural elements which were salvaged are being used in the restoration. 
All the beautifully carved wooden elements rescued from the ruins, as well as the tiles which were recovered, are being used to help rebuild the courtyard’s façade. 
The restoration, reconstruction and conversion work gives an immediate insight into a multifaceted palace complex which contributes hugely to the identity of the Kathmandu-Patan metropolis and is thus a symbol of the area’s rich architectural heritage.

Responsibility for implementing the work lies with the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust, which has saved and restored numerous buildings in Kathmandu and Patan since 1992. 
With the instalment of the two new State Secretaries, the top echelon of the Federal Foreign Office is again complete only a few weeks after Foreign Minister Gabriel himself assumed office. 
Bidding farewell to State Secretary Steinlein 
Speaking to a packed Weltsaal, Foreign Minister Gabriel addressed the old and new State Secretaries, also making quite a few humorous remarks. 
On behalf of all staff, Gabriel first thanked outgoing State Secretary Steinlein for his work and accomplishments. 
Steinlein had been one of the “key supporters of and a driving force behind” reforms at the Federal Foreign Office and in German foreign policy. 
Referring to the close relationship between Steinlein and former Foreign Minister Steinmeier, Gabriel said the “stone age” at the Federal Foreign Office was now ending ‑ alluding to the German meaning of "Stein" as in Steinlein's and Steinmeier's names. 
Together with State Secretary Markus Ederer, they will now join the top echelon at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said he very much looks forward to working with Lindner. 
Sontowski previously held the post of State Secretary at the Federal Economic Affairs Ministry and has been on Gabriel’s staff for many years. 
At the Federal Foreign Office, a principal task of State Secretary Sontowski will be political coordination with the other Federal Ministries and with the Länder, in connection with Foreign Minister Gabriel’s role as Vice Chancellor. 
He added that it is all the more important to now focus fully on all tasks related to Europe, with the aim of making Europe stronger. 
The Federal Foreign Office is, he pointed out, “the only Federal Ministry that never sleeps”, since its staff are on duty 24/7 around the world.

We are restoring the murals here in the temple. 
What role does the project play for the people in the region with regard to culture and identity? 
“These are the oldest murals in Laos. 
The murals were in a very, very bad state. 
We are trying to preserve and restore them so that they can be read once again. 
An important part of this project is training people, of course. 
Souvixay, Trainee Restorer, teacher for murals, National Institute of Fine Arts 
Cultural preservation – video on Laos 
The museum and Buddhist cloisters feature over 300 large statues of the Buddha from the 15th to the 19th century, as well as unique murals from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
They were so soiled that you couldn’t make them out any more. 
One of them is the Syrian Heritage Archive Project. 
The murals are so important because they also depict a part of Lao history that you can see virtually nowhere else. 
They are very important for the Lao as they are part of the origins of their own artistic culture. 
I am therefore working with six artists, three of whom are teachers at the National Institute of Fine Arts and three are working in the art department of the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. 
The project has been running since 2013. 
to save the murals of the Wat Si Saket cloisters in Vientiane, Laos. 
Dr Bounthhieng Xaysingdykeo, historian and staff member at the Wat Si Saket museum 
Efforts to conserve and restore the murals, which are extremely endangered, have been under way since 2011 with the support of the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Society for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (GEKE) “We are here in Wat Si Saket, the oldest building complex in the city of Vientiane, the capital of Laos. 
We are developing various databases – a geodatabase, an image database and an object database detailing damage to specific buildings. 
My job is to generate maps of the Old Towns in Aleppo and Damascus, 
so that various historic buildings can be integrated into the iDAI.gazetteer system. 
Sausan Saleh, German Archaeological Institute – Syrian Heritage Archive Project 
“I have to enter these place names into the iDAI-gazetteer webservice. This creates the links with all the data we get from the Museum. 
Who uses the archived data? 
They will find all the information, including about all works and projects, in the iDAI-gazetteer.” 
“The cultures are mixed in Syria. 
The “Aleppo Room” in the Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin is proof of the intensive exchange with other cultures, religions and ethnic groups. It shows just how rich our cultural heritage is. 
This richness is the result of openness. 
Projects like this are not “about Syria”: they are with Syria, with the Syrians. 
It’s all about capacity-building. 
What is the project’s particular relevance given the ongoing destruction of cultural sites? 
What’s been the best aspect of the project for you personally? 
OK, I’m a long way from Syria, but this way I can do something for my country! 
It was really nice at the UNESCO conference on safeguarding cultural heritage in Syria in Berlin. 
Of course everyone has their own political agenda, but at the conference politics didn’t come into it. 
That was very positive, although the war in Syria is unimaginable. 
Nevertheless, 
were were all happy about this cooperation. 
To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.”

more and more governments are trying to limit the scope of civil society organisations, sometimes to a significant extent. 
One focus is the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The G20’s considerable economic clout brings with it great responsibility. 
Nevertheless, the exchange is important. 
It should provide impetus for strengthening crisis prevention, addressing global imbalances and poverty and helping to build a peaceful, fair and sustainable world order. 
Identifying crises at an early stage has to be part of this foreign policy. 
Together with African Union representative Anthony Mothae Maruping, we will discuss what general conditions are needed to combat poverty, strengthen state institutions and ensure that more is done to unlock the potential of many African states. 
The meeting should create key impetus for a sustainable international order. 
it shows our will to reject isolationism and nationalism and to embrace international dialogue and cooperation. 
While we are addressing the symptoms with humanitarian assistance and diplomatic peace missions, we must not lose sight of the factors which cause these crises. 
Agenda 2030 could become the main reference point for a more just and more peaceful world order. 
For example, climate change and water scarcity will present us with completely new challenges for which we have to be as well prepared as possible. 
With the resources available to it, the G20 can become a crucial player in implementing this global project to create greater fairness. 
G20 Foreign Ministers meet in Bonn 
How can global order be shaped through joint efforts? 
On 16 and 17 February, the G20 Foreign Ministers will convene for a meeting in Bonn organised by Germany’s G20 Presidency. 
On 16 and 17 February, 20 Foreign Ministers will convene for a meeting in Bonn, at which international organisations, too, will be represented. 
Zoya Masoud, Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin – Syrian Heritage Archive Project 
“Shaping the global order – foreign policy beyond crisis management” will be the overarching theme of the meeting in Bonn. 
In 2013, the Federal Foreign Office launched the German Partnership Program for Excellence in Biological and Health Security in order to implement long-term biosecurity projects in various countries under the auspices of the G7 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. 
In 2016, the decision was taken to continue the Program until the end of 2019. 
Place names are entered into the gazetteer in various languages and spellings. Their coordinates are given. Each place has a unique identifier, so that everything can be linked up.” 
Recently, foreign policy has been preoccupied with addressing acute crises and conflicts. This informal meeting, however, is intended to examine long-term objectives and the ways in which foreign policy can tackle key global challenges. 
Cooperation within the framework of the G20 
The city of Bonn will host the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting 
The aim is not only to prevent any misuse of infectious agents that could also pose a threat to Germany, 
That’s over 40 people building their capacities for the future of their country!“ 
“Foreign policy is, and must be, more than crisis management,” Gabriel said prior to the meeting. 
but also to strengthen the health services of our partner countries in Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe, thus enhancing their national security. 
The Programme encompasses a range of projects implemented in cooperation with German institutions: 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI) 
Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health (FLI) 
The main focus is on North Africa, West Africa and Central Asia. 
Priority is given to six areas: 
The Syrian Heritage Archive Project aims to compile a digital register of analogue documents produced about archaeological and historical sites and monuments in Syria during decades of international research activity. 
“The Syrian Heritage Archive Project is a joint initiative by the German Archaeological Institute and the Museum of Islamic Art funded by the Federal Foreign Office. 
And then things move on to Sausan at the German Archaeological Institute.” 
“This process of archiving and digitising research data ultimately aims to produce a database for use by everyone, not just academics, but anyone who wants to know more about Syria. 
What does the project mean for your homeland Syria? 
Syria’s character derives from various societies and groups belonging to different cultures. 
This project is very important, not only for Syria’s identity, but for the identity of the whole world. 
There are 8 Syrians working on the Syrian Heritage Archive Project, with another 32 to come from 2017. 
As many activists are working right on the spot in Aleppo to document the destruction of these historic buildings, it is our responsibility to make sure their work does not get lost. 
I am really proud of this work. 
We went there with a common goal: to safeguard cultural heritage in Syria. 
He went on to emphasise that terrorism, water scarcity, climate change, forced migration and humanitarian emergencies cannot be resolved by isolation, but only through cooperation and joint strategies. 
This helps to immediately recognise outbreaks of dangerous and highly contagious diseases, reduce infection and swiftly identify and eliminate the causes.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel today (15 February) on the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting 
Noch dazu gekommen: 
Humanitarian emergencies, forced migration, armed conflicts and terrorism are often the product of fundamental negative economic and social developments. 
The aim of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting is to make possible a discussion within an informal framework on the role of foreign policy in tackling global challenges. 
Another focus is maintaining long-term peace in a world characterized by a new disorder. 
This is about a forward-looking policy and prevention instead of crisis management. 
Only if we succeed in offering those both within and outside the G20 states who feel left behind fair prospects of security, prosperity and peace will we be able to create a sustainable global order. 
The G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting cannot solve all international problems at once. 
The great interest in the G20 member states in this meeting in Bonn is a good sign: 
Meeting organised by German G20 Presidency is first major event hosted by Germany’s new Foreign Minister 
The Wat Si Saket murals are Lao paintings that are perhaps the first and only ones to be produced in a “Signature Lao style” that came into being autonomously – independent from scholastic Thai painting. 
Now that they have been restored, you can see the story they tell once again. 
“Germany will be a forum for global politics in the coming days,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said about the upcoming meeting, which will also be his first major event as German Foreign Minister. 
Working with people who are already well placed to pass this knowledge on later is the best thing you can do to ensure the long-term impact of the project. 
Many of the participants will travel directly from Bonn to the annual Munich Security Conference. 
My favourite moment in the project is... 
Our team consists of ten restorers, seven of whom are from Laos and have a background in fine arts. They are receiving training to become restorers in the course of this project.” 
They are from the year 1824, when these were the private cloisters for the last king of Laos. 
Luang Prabang was a different kingdom, and the murals there are very different and rather take their inspiration from Thailand. 
The Program is intended to help partner countries tackle biosecurity threats, such as the intentional misuse of biological pathogens and toxins or outbreaks of highly pathogenic diseases and pandemics.

awareness-raising; biosecurity; disease monitoring; detection and diagnostics; networking; and capacity-building. 
With a budget of over 25 million euros for the period 2013-16 and a further 18 million euros for 2017-19, we are helping partner countries to minimise biosecurity threats. 
On 21 December 2016, the Cabinet approved the twelfth Human Rights Report, which describes the human rights situation in Germany and around the world. 
Bild Artikel 1 GG … 
Article 1 of the Basic Law states that “human dignity shall be inviolable” 
Article 1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany is not restricted to Germany. It also includes a mandate for German foreign policy to foster and protect human rights all over the world. 
At the same time, the Federal Foreign Office supports human rights activists who are in difficult situations and promotes civil‑society organisations, for example via training and exchange programmes. 
Along with its European partners, it conducts regular human rights dialogues with some 40 non‑EU member states. 
The report covers the period from 1 March 2014 to 30 September 2016. 
The world’s largest economies that are represented in the G20 bear special responsibility and must jointly address the root causes of conflicts, as well as the options for peaceful crisis prevention and conflict resolution, Gabriel went on to say. 
The meeting will focus on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, crisis prevention and, peace policy, and cooperation with Africa.

Together with an African Union representative, the G20 will discuss what general conditions are needed to combat poverty, strengthen state institutions and ensure that more is done to harness the potential of many African states. 
The Foreign Minister pointed out that no country in the world can tackle the major international problems of our time alone. 
assuming humanitarian responsibility together

Foreign Minister Gabriel after his meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister 
I am pleased to have had my first opportunity to talk in person with my Chinese counterpart Wang Yi today. 
The initiative was launched by the Federal Foreign Office. 
The need for humanitarian assistance throughout the world is on the rise. 
We share many foreign-policy interests – conflict prevention, peace missions and climate protection, where China has achieved a great deal in the past few years and where we want to cooperate even more closely in future. 
In addition, Germany and China are both interested in expanding their economic relations. 
But Germany and China are linked by far more than just trade. 
So we also talked intensively today about our cooperation in the fields of civil society and education, where we want to intensify exchanges between young people from Germany and China. 
Such an exchange can only be of benefit to both sides. 
One of them is Patan Royal Palace along with the temples in the palace complex. 
Bild Zerstörungen… 
Since 2008, the Federal Foreign Office has provided a total of 250,000 euros for the preservation of the palace and the temples in the complex. 
For example, in various stages, the fountain in the south courtyard, Sundari Chowk, and the Bhandarkal water tank were restored, followed by the building’s south wing and the rear section of Sundari Chowk. 
When Nepal was hit by a severe earthquake in April 2015, the restored wings of the square courtyard stayed standing, but virtually the whole east wing caved in. 
This is possible thanks to the traditional construction techniques using clay mortar, especially as the masons and carpenters are the descendants of those who created this architecture back in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
The upper storey of the main courtyard building has been home to the “Architecture Galleries” museum of architecture since 2013. This is open to the public as part of Patan Museum, which was established in 1997. 
When work on the east wing is finished, Sundari Chowk will complete the museum in January 2017.

Cooperation in the Baltic Sea region 
Council of the Baltic Sea States 
The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) was established in 1992 at the initiative of the foreign ministers of Germany and Denmark, in order to stabilise and support the political and economic transition of the Baltic Sea region. 
Its membership comprises the nine states actually on the Baltic Sea – Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden – as well as Norway, Iceland and the EU. 
Antarctica is the coldest, driest and stormiest of all continents. 
It is almost forty times as large as Germany and is the only uninhabited continent. 
Even in summer (from December to February) 99% of Antarctica is covered in ice, up to 5000 metres thick in places. 
It is regarded as a natural archive of Earth’s natural history and has a decisive influence on the global climate system and the marine ecosystems associated with the Southern Ocean. 
For numerous countries it serves as an “open-air laboratory”, resulting in the discovery, for instance, of the hole in the ozone layer. 
The Antarctic Treaty applies to the area south of 60° South Latitude. 
It guarantees the freedom of scientific research and seeks to promote international cooperation to that end. 
With a view to protecting the Antarctic environment comprehensively, in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and its five currently effective Annexes were drawn up. With the passage of the German Implementing Act in 1998, they came into effect for Germany. 
A sixth Annex on Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies was adopted in 2005 at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in Stockholm. 
The Antarctic Treaty steering body is the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) of the Contracting Parties with consultative status, that is with the right to vote under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty. 
This status is also granted to Contracting Parties which acceded after the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty on 23 June 1961 if they demonstrate their particular interest in Antarctica by engaging in considerable scientific research. 
German positions are presented by the Federal Foreign Office acting in close consultation and cooperation with other relevant ministries. 
The Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty based in Buenos Aires which was established at the 26th ATCM (ATCM XXVI) in 2003 in Madrid officially started its work in September 2004. 
The ATCMs held since 1961 have adopted more than 250 regulations and procedures, the majority of which are concerned with protecting the Antarctic environment. 
ATCM agendas are currently dominated by issues relating to implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection, climate change and the Antarctic environment, international research cooperation as well as regulations and guidelines for tourism in the region. 
Activities in Antarctica 
The prime activity carried out in Antarctica is scientific research. 
In the research stations that are manned all year round, which currently number more than 40, scientists work – in many cases with international colleagues – on a wide variety of projects ranging from routine monitoring to basic research. 
German research is coordinated by the Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar‑ und Meeresforschung. 
The Institute supplies the necessary equipment and logistics and also runs the Neumeyer III Station, which was opened in February 2009 and operates all year round, as well as the research ship Polarstern. 
In addition to traditional research fields such as geology, geophysics, biology and meteorology, there is now an increasing focus on climate change issues. 
It is hoped this will shed light on what role man-made pollution plays in the climate changes now being recorded and provide a basis for predicting future trends. 
These research programmes highlight how crucial the continent is for the global climate. 
In order to protect the environment and research activities, the Protocol on Environmental Protection requires tour operators to have every visit authorised by the competent national authority (in Germany the Federal Environment Agency). 
The 1988 Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA), which was intended to permit the extraction of minerals under very strict environmental conditions, was not ratified and therefore never entered into force. 
All German activities in Antarctica now require authorisation from the Federal Environmental Agency (Section 3 of the Act Implementing the Protocol on Environmental Protection). 
One of its functions is to set quotas for fishing in Antarctic waters and monitor compliance. 
In 2016, the CCAMLR Contracting Parties agreed for the first time on the designation of a comprehensive Marine Protected Area in the Ross Sea and considered the EU proposal in which Germany was pivotal on the designation of a further Marine Protected Area around the Weddell Sea which is species-rich and as yet unaffected by fishing. 
Since 2006 “the Antarctic issue” has no longer featured on the United Nations agenda. 
As the Antarctic Treaty Contracting Parties point out, any member of the United Nations may join the Antarctic Treaty System, whose value and effectiveness have been clearly demonstrated over the years. 
Following his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi today (16 February) on the fringes of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement: 
Germany and China are linked by very close and friendly ties, not only economic and political relations but above all links between the peoples of our two countries. 
We agreed that we want to further develop our comprehensive strategic partnership, particularly in these turbulent times in global politics. 
China has given repeated assurances that it intends to continue to open its markets and implement reforms. 
I therefore asked Minister Wang that China underscore these assurances with clear signals that foreign companies will be treated equally in China, for instance in the field of electric mobility. 
China has set itself ambitious goals in this area, and German companies can make an important contribution with their know-how – if the conditions are right. 
In 2014, the Council of the Baltic Sea States agreed on three new long-term priorities: 
Fostering regional identity 
Creating a safe and secure region 
The CBSS Secretariat is based in Stockholm. 
Developing a sustainable and prosperous region 
The EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) is the first of the EU’s four macro-regional strategies, and as such is a pilot project for a new form of cooperation within the EU. 
The Action Plan focuses on three objectives: 
Saving the sea 
Connecting the region 
Increasing prosperity 
Its remit is regional strategic planning for the Baltic Sea states, coordinated through the EU. 
Annual forums are held to present EUSBSR projects.

Foreign Minister Gabriel considers this meeting a beacon event. 
As he stressed, holding the meeting in one of the cities where the United Nations is based was a mark of support for international cooperation. 
“This is an affirmation of what foreign policy calls multilateralism – i.e. cooperation by everyone with everyone else,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said before the first working session.

As he noted, terrorism, water scarcity, climate change, forced migration and humanitarian emergencies cannot be resolved by isolation, but only through cooperation and by means of joint strategies. 
That is, he said, what makes the G20 Summit so important. 
Together, the G20 nations account for almost two-thirds of the global population, more than four-fifths of gross world product and three-quarters of global trade. 
Meeting focuses on the 2030 Agenda, peace, and cooperation with Africa 
The meeting is therefore focusing on implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. 
The 2030 Agenda was adopted at a UN summit in September 2015 by all UN member states. Civil society, too, played a key role in drawing up the Agenda. 
With its 17 goals, the Agenda promotes sustainability in the social, environmental and economic spheres. The G20 wants to become a key driving force in the implementation of this global project. 
Another focus is on the long-term sustainment of peace in the world today. Prevention and forward-looking foreign policy will be at the heart of this debate. 
A third focus of the meeting is on cooperation with Africa.

The meeting of Foreign Ministers is being organised by Germany as part of its G20 Presidency. 
The major event of this year’s Presidency will be the summit meeting of G20 Heads of State and Government in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July. 
The motto of Germany’s G20 Presidency is “shaping an interconnected world”, and discussions centre around “building resilience”, “improving sustainability” and “assuming responsibility”.

A world in which all people would be protected as individuals, their dignity sacrosanct. 
It was a vision of a better world that brought men and woman from across the globe to Paris sixty years ago, in 1948. 
The Federal Foreign Office and other federal ministries, as well as the German Länder Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Schleswig-Holstein, are all involved in Baltic Sea cooperation. 
Since its inception, the Council of the Baltic Sea States has developed a broad network of inter-state cooperation in numerous sectors spanning the Baltic Sea and north-western Russia. 
The Council Presidency rotates between the members on an annual basis. Iceland took over from Poland in July 2016. 
The 8th Annual Forum will be hosted by the Federal Foreign Office in June 2017 and will centre on the theme of connectivity. 
The Northern Dimension covers a broad geographical area in northern Europe, including the far north (and the Barents Sea region), the Baltic Sea region and north-western Russia. 
The science and business communities are involved in the work of the Northern Dimension through the Northern Dimension Institute (NDI) and the Northern Dimension Business Council (NDBC). 
Germany is a party to all major UN human rights conventions and their supplementary protocols. 
Germany most recently signed the Additional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as the individual complaint mechanism of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
In Europe there is a closely-knit network of institutions dedicated to the protection of human rights. 
The European Union and above all the Council of Europe and OSCE play a key role here.

Germany’s international human rights obligations 
Human dignity and inviolable and inalienable human rights are accordingly enshrined in Article 1 of Germany’s Basic Law “as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world”. 
The Basic Law thus not only guarantees human rights in Germany, but also obliges us to protect human dignity and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. 
Moral obligation and political interests 
Campaigning for human rights is not, however, only a moral and legal obligation under the Basic Law. 
Upholding human rights is also in Germany’s diplomatic interests. 
Examples from around the world show that 
The three pillars of cooperation in the Baltic Sea region in which Germany plays an active role are the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the Northern Dimension. 
long-term peace and sustained development are not possible where human rights are violated. 
In contrast, where freedoms and dignity are protected, the conditions are right for creativity and prosperity. 
Within the Federal Foreign Office, alongside Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Barbara Kofler, there is an entire division responsible for human rights and gender issues. 
The best defender of human rights – a vibrant civil society 
Germany makes this a key priority in its international work. 
If citizens are able to be active in independent groups and public fora, this constitutes one of the best forms of protection against a wanton disregard of human rights. 
Some things are non-negotiable: Germany continues to campaign assiduously for human rights around the world. 
With this aim in mind, they adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Everyone is entitled to human rights – simply by virtue of being human, and irrespective of any characteristic that may be used to differentiate between individuals. 
Germany’s commitment to human rights work is also a lesson learned from the darkest chapter of our history. 
Together they make use of a great variety of instruments. Funding programmes for non-governmental organisations, political dialogue, public statements and quiet diplomacy, for example, have already improved the human rights situation in many countries. 
If human rights are to be protected, it is vital for the general public to be vigilant and to respond to any violations. 
Germany is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

The foundation for international human rights protection is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948.

The participating Foreign Ministers and diplomats at the G20 Summit converged on Bonn from all directions – from Japan to Mexico, and from Russia to Canada. 
It was not without reason that Gabriel had invited his counterparts to Bonn. 
As he stressed, holding the meeting in one of the cities where the United Nations is based was a mark of support for international cooperation. 
“I think everyone felt it was really good to meet in this format,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said at the final press conference in Bonn.

Foreign Minister Gabriel will therefore discuss with his counterparts from Russia, France and Ukraine which steps can be taken to further the implementation of the Minsk agreement.

The Munich Security Conference is also an important occasion for conducting bilateral meetings on the margins of the conference. 
“These problems can only be successfully resolved through cooperation,” said Gabriel, “and certainly not by isolation.” 
The G20 Meeting was therefore an important symbol. 
The world’s largest economies that are represented in the G20 bear special responsibility and must jointly address the root causes of conflicts, as well as the options for peaceful crisis prevention and conflict resolution. 
Focal points: 
The Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich becomes a global arena each year in February, 
when heads of government, foreign policymakers and decision-makers from all over the world meet to discuss the most important challenges facing global security. 
One focus of the meeting was the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – according to Gabriel, “the most important instrument for global justice”. 
The Munich Security Conference, an especially significant annual political meeting, has been a forum for the global dialogue on security policy for over 50 years. 
The 2030 Agenda, peace, better opportunities for Africa 
The 2030 Agenda was adopted at a UN summit in September 2015 by all UN member states. Civil society, too, played a role in drawing up the Agenda. 
The G20 wants to become a crucial player in implementing this global project. 
The German Government will be represented by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, , Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière and Development Minister Gerd Müller. 
In view of the great challenges facing global security and stability, the world’s largest security policy dialogue forum is regarded as particularly important this year. 
A third focal point for the meeting was cooperation with Africa. 
Along with a large number of heads of state and government, the participants will include UN Secretary-General António Guterres, US Vice President Mike Pence, US Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 
How can state and civil-society institutions in African countries be strengthened? 
From Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, and Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, to Bill Gates and Bono, the participants in Munich come from a very wide range of fields in global civil society. 
A meeting in the Normandy format will also take place on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. 
The ceasefire has in Ukraine has been breached more often recently. 
In addition to giving a speech in the hotel ballroom, Foreign Minister Gabriel has a packed schedule of one-to-one talks on current issues with a large number of his counterparts. 
Meeting of the Group of Friends of Syria 
A meeting of Foreign Ministers of states belonging to the so-called Group of Friends of Syria was held on the fringes of the G20 conference. 
The humanitarian situation in large parts of Syria is still very critical. 
The participants agreed that 
only negotiations under UN auspices can improve the situation. 
“The regime in Damascus will not hold any serious negotiations of its own accord. 
That is why it is important to convince Russia to support these negotiations,” Gabriel said after the meeting.

The Foreign Ministers Meeting was organised by Germany as part of its G20 Presidency. 
The major event of this year’s Presidency will be the summit meeting of G20 Heads of State and Government in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July. 
The motto of the German Presidency is “Shaping an interconnected world”,

Today (17 February), on the fringes of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn, Foreign Minister Gabriel met colleagues in a smaller format to discuss the most recent developments in Syria. 
After the meeting, the German Foreign Minister spoke of “momentum” for the continuation of the political negotiations in Geneva. 
The focus was on the most recent developments in Syria as well as the question of how to make progress on finding a political solution to the conflict. 
Situation in Syria remains dramatic

After the meeting, Foreign Minister Gabriel said that with regard to the situation in Syria “a good portion of realism was needed”, as had become clear once again during the talks. 
He said that the ceasefire remained precarious and fragile and the humanitarian situation was still “disastrous”.

Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 February) after his meeting with the Foreign Ministers of France, Russia and Ukraine on the fringes of the Munich Security Conference: 
At today's foreign ministers meeting in the Normandy format on the fringes of the Munich Security Conference, we, the Foreign Ministers of France, Russia, Ukraine and Germany, reached the following agreements regarding the serious escalation of ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine: 
But without a ceasefire and without the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the political process cannot gain momentum.

Message by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth, Member of the German Bundestag 
The documenta in Kassel is the world’s most important showcase for contemporary art. 
namely to arrive at a ceasefire with effect from 20 February and to do what has long been agreed but never came about: 
This is especially the case this year. 
removing and securing heavy weapons from the area and giving the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission the opportunity to monitor where they are. 
For the first time, the documenta 14 is taking place in two different places. 
G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting: 
The meeting of Foreign Ministers in Bonn was organised by Germany as part of its G20 Presidency. 
The artistic director of this year’s documenta Adam Szymczyk is building an artistic bridge between Greece and Germany. 
I am delighted and encouraged by this. 
The first documenta was opened in Kassel by Arnold Bode on 15 July 1955. 
It is a testament to his incredible vitality that, despite painful experiences and great privation, he found the strength to launch a new movement for modern art on the ruins left behind by the war. 
We have agreed that the exchange of prisoners is to be continued rapidly ‑ with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
We will meet again in a few weeks to continue working on the next steps in the political process ‑ that will be the most difficult task. 
Together, we appeal to those who are currently blocking roads and railway tracks to stop these blockades because they are harming both sides ‑ those who want to export coal and those who need it to generate electricity. 
After the Nazi dictatorship, which he referred to as “lost years”, he set about his plans for the first documenta with an enormous sense of purpose. 
A positive picture: G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting under the German Presidency 
The UN Secretary‑General, António Guterres, also attended the meeting. 
in an interconnected world, even local crises often have a huge impact around the globe. 
Foreign Ministers Sigmar Gabriel and Sergey Lavrov spoke about German‑Russian relations and the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine 
and his cultural legacy lives on in the documenta until this day. 
The exhibition The Myth of documenta – Arnold Bode and his Heirs is a homage to Arnold Bode, the documenta and the freedom of art. 
With its17 goals, the Agenda aims to ensure greater sustainability in the social, environmental and economic spheres. 
The meeting also focused on the question of how to secure peace and stability in the long term: a joined‑up, forward‑looking foreign policy can prevent global crises before they emerge. 
Permit me to wish each and every visitor to the exhibition a great deal of curiosity and inspiration. 
What framework conditions are needed so that the African continent’s economic potential can develop fully? 
The G20 Foreign Ministers had an intense discussion on these questions with representatives of the African Union. 
Group of Friends of Syria: 
strengthen negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations 
with discussions centring around three areas: “building resilience”, “improving sustainability” and “assuming responsibility”. 
G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting: Signal for cooperation

The Human Rights Council is the most important forum in the United Nations for ensuring that these agreements are observed. 
The Human Rights Council comprises 47 elected member states and has various instruments at its disposal to work for global respect for human rights. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel stated that it had become clear “that all those who came together definitely desire a political solution, because a military solution alone will not lead to peace in Syria. 
The documenta has no boundaries. 
Gabriel said that the path leading to a resolution of the conflict was still long. 
With the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Human Rights Council examines the human rights situation in each UN member state at four-yearly intervals. 
“But everyone has pledged their support to it, specifically also those who were new to the group”, including the new United States Secretary of State Tillerson. 
Alongside Kassel, the Greek capital Athens will be the exhibition’s second conceptual location. 
The aim is not merely to check up on states, but also to provide help if there are problems with implementation. 
Gabriel added that they had “performed good groundwork for Geneva” and had agreed to meet regularly in that format. 
On a repeat review, the states have to declare whether and how they have implemented the recommendations from the previous round. 
It was thanks to Bode’s commitment and passion for modern art that his home city of Kassel became established as a centre of modern art around the world. 
He managed to establish the documenta as a permanent fixture of Kassel’s cultural calendar. 
I gladly assumed the patronage for this extremely important exhibition. 
I would be delighted to have the privilege of welcoming you to Kassel as visitors of the documenta. 
Instead, it overcomes them.

Art is taking a stand and getting involved, 
which is something that can only be to the benefit of the political arena. 
On 28 October 2015, Germany was re-elected by the General Assembly and will thus remain on the Council until 2018. 
During its membership, Germany will work to raise the profile of the Council as a central body and early-warning mechanism for the international protection of human rights. 
The Human Rights Council must address critical human rights situations systematically and make full use of all of the instruments at its disposal.

The Federal Foreign Office coordinates the Federal Government’s humanitarian assistance and works on innovations in the humanitarian assistance field -- such as bringing on board new players and donors. 
In order to do justice to this mandate, Aktion Deutschland Hilft places a particular focus on transparent communication with business and humanitarian players. 
Since 2005 the alliance has been in dialogue with enterprises engaged in humanitarian assistance and regularly discusses with them the specific challenges they face in this context. 
“We must not allow ourselves to be drawn into an arms race” 
Interview with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the occasion of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn and the Munich Security Conference. 
Mr Gabriel, many people are deeply concerned about the state of our world. 
What is your impression after the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting? 
The international tone has become harsher. 
That makes meetings like the one in Bonn, where the key international players can come together and talk to one another, all the more important. 
Nevertheless, 
in Bonn I didn’t speak to anyone who wasn’t in favour of openness and international cooperation. 
It is far too early to say that the danger is over, but it is encouraging and something we can build on. 
Isn’t Germany, as a medium‑sized power in Europe, a little out of its depth with such a major project? 
I always felt that the calls for Germany to play an “active” role were misleading. 
I would rather describe it as an “activating” role. 
We need to make Europe better and stronger. 
The United Nations is the most important international organisation ensuring human rights protection worldwide. 
Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations states that protecting human rights is one of the organisation’s prime purposes. 
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which entered into force in 1966 and 1976 respectively, were further milestones ensuring binding protection for human rights under international law. 
In addition, the Human Rights Council can launch a special procedure, focusing either on the situation in a particular country or on a specific international human rights issue, and appoint a special rapporteur or a group of independent experts to deal with these matters. 
If there have been systematic, gross, reliably attested human rights violations, a complaint procedure can be initiated. 
Germany is a member of the Human Rights Council in 2016-2018 
for the exhibition The Myth of documenta – Arnold Bode and his Heirs, in Beijing and Shanghai in the spring of 2017 (opening in Beijing scheduled for 1 March 2017) 
Each documenta is a bold undertaking and a great adventure. 
Featuring the title “Learning from Athens”, the public is invited to view the political, cultural, economic and social developments in Greece and Europe in recent years from an artistic perspective. 
Artists will work together at both locations to make this possible. 
Bode’s life was informed by bitter experiences in two world wars and during the National Socialist dictatorship. 
Looking back, Arnold said that he “had to make something out of Kassel in order not to perish”. 
He remained closely affiliated to the documenta until his death in 1977, 
That is why strengthening Europe forms the backbone of our foreign policy. 
Every five years, renowned artists from around the world meet at the heart of Germany and Europe in order to hold discussions and to reflect on the world as it is today as well as develop ideas on how it should be. 
The Americans are calling for more defence policy engagement from Europe. 
Can you understand where they are coming from? 
We understand and accept that. 
After all, Europe’s economic clout is just as large as the United States’. 
Washington is calling for expenditure amounting to two per cent of national income. 
Are you going to go along with that? 
We’ve known for a long time that overcoming war, crises and conflicts requires a much greater commitment to prevention, stabilisation and poverty reduction. 
Germany already plays a leading role in the world in this area and is doing more than many others. 
And that this political solution must be achieved through the Geneva negotiations ‑ under the auspices of the United Nations.” 
That’s why we must not allow ourselves to be drawn blindly into an arms race. 
Anyone who wants to spend more than 20 billion euros each year on the Bundeswehr also needs to explain where the money will come from. 
What concrete steps can politicians take to counter and dispel these fears? 
that the world trade order is under pressure, from both the right and the left. 
This new protectionism poses a threat not only to our globally active and interconnected German business sector, but also to peace and security. 
The proponents of open borders and fair trade need to present a united front. 
We can’t afford to grow weary of explaining the advantages of openness and exchange. 
A few tweets aren’t going to destroy all that. 
There was considerable support for this in Bonn. 
The new US President Donald Trump doesn’t want to have anything to do with free trade. 
The EU, in contrast, has just concluded a new agreement with Canada, is now driving forward talks with South America – and could theoretically also open up a new chapter in trade policy in its relations with Asia. 
What’s your general view of an agreement between the EU and Asia? 
Europe has every reason to be self-confident. 
In Bonn it was the countries of Latin America and Asia which showed the greatest interest in closer cooperation. 
Europe recognised this before Trump joined the US election campaign. 
We need to and we intend to pursue these, now more than ever. 
Would you be in favour of involving China right away, too? 
Of course. 
China has been a global catalyst for growth for many years. 
The German economy is in a good position, with more than 8000 German enterprises in the Middle Kingdom. 
Yet in China, too, there is the tendency to isolate markets and apply different rules to foreign enterprises than to local ones. 
It goes without saying that the government will raise these issues with Beijing where necessary. 
Will the nationalists soon assert themselves in capital cities all over the world – or will the globally minded powers manage to establish some sort of global network of reason? 
Acting on its own, Germany would undoubtedly be out of its depth. 
We need to bring the combined weight of Europe to bear in order to ensure that our interests and values continue to be represented at a global level. 
In the long term it is only through Europe that we will be able to maintain our sovereignty, our influence and our capability to act. 
The current debate gives me cause for serious reflection. 
Of course the United States will no longer bear the largest burden of defence expenditure. 
Europe will therefore have to do more, and it embarked on this turnaround before the election of Donald Trump. 
The debate on peace and security has experienced a serious setback if once again the impression is given that a massive increase in the arms budget alone will improve security. 
All this has not been thought through and is quite unrealistic. 
We would do well to show a little less agitation and adopt a broader perspective. 
Throughout the world the dangers of potential new trade wars, such as those in the early 1930s, are being expounded. 
The history of our continent shows how quickly it can happen, how protectionism on each side rubs off on the other, leading to poverty and mass unemployment, and ultimately to confrontation. 
The world is now more interconnected and integrated than ever before; value chains have an international focus. 
We work to keep communication channels open, and we can provide good arguments. 
Our single market is the largest in the world, we are in a good position and are an attractive partner for all of the world’s trade areas. 
The CETA with Canada is ready to enter into force, and free trade negotiations are under way with MERCOSUR, Japan, Singapore, Viet Nam, Indonesia and others. 
And there, too, it is only by joining forces that we will be strong enough to ensure that our valid concerns are taken seriously. 
Matthias Koch. 
We always need to perceive our role as an element of European engagement. 
And don’t forget that we are spending several dozens of billions of euros on refugees, because military interventions have not brought peace to the Middle East, but instead have generated more suffering and misery, more refugees and displaced persons.

The meeting is intended as a forum for exchange away from day-to-day crisis management. 
In many cases, enterprises are already valuable partners in dealing with acute humanitarian emergency situations and can play a key role in boosting efficiency in humanitarian assistance and developing emergency aid capacities. 
The #CSRhumanitär initiative fosters new approaches to encourage the business sector to assume its societal responsibility for global humanitarian challenges and support needs‑based humanitarian assistance. 
The initiative is designed to tap the potential of entrepreneurial engagement above and beyond philanthropy in alignment with companies’ core business (know‑how transfer, staff mobilisation, material resources) and provide a platform to further develop the status quo of humanitarian assistance and shape future disaster relief approaches. 
The dialogue on the possibilities and limitations of partner‑based cooperation is intended to help develop joint innovative approaches so that needs‑based, culturally and socially appropriate humanitarian assistance can be provided abroad. 
through surveys and dialogue‑based events, the process participants (representatives of civil society, politics and business) formulate humanitarian needs and develop opportunities for cooperation. 
Implementation through multi‑stakeholder dialogue 
Particular attention is given to fostering communication on an equal footing to facilitate trust‑based exchange. 
Creating a common language and building trust 
For Gabriel, the event is also a chance to meet his new fellow foreign ministers. 
A survey of supporters of the initiative revealed that the areas of health and logistics are particularly relevant for entrepreneurial engagement in humanitarian assistance. 
After the event, many of the participants travelled on to Munich for the Security Conference. 
The #CSRhumanitär initiative: 
Interested enterprises and humanitarian agencies are warmly invited to help shape the dialogue process! 
The unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is one of the key conflict areas in the Middle East. 
the unresolved conflicts between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon. 
On 1 July 2016, the Middle East Quartet (EU, UN, US, Russia) presented a report identifying the main obstacles on the road to a two-state solution. 
The European Union supported from the outset the intensive efforts undertaken by the US to bring about the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. 
World politics comes to Bonn. In his new role as foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel welcomes his counterparts to this meeting convened under the German G20 Presidency. 
This is the second time that the foreign ministers of the 20 largest industrialised countries and emerging economies have met in this framework. 
In numerous bilateral meetings he spoke with his new counterparts, including the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. 
The main plenary session focused on long-term goals: the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, crisis prevention and cooperation with Africa. 
In Gabriel’s words, the G20 meeting was important because: 
“Together, the G20 states produce four fifths of global real net output. 
This gives the Group enormous political and economic weight, but it also brings great responsibility. That’s why it is important to talk to each other and to consider how we, as the G20, can support the goals the world community has set itself, for example in the 2030 Agenda, i.e. the 17 goals through which together we seek to make life better for everyone on our planet. The first and foremost goal is combating extreme poverty in this world.” 
Despite intensive US efforts, it was not possible to get the two parties to reach an agreement. 
As long as a resumption of negotiations, which remains the goal of German and European Middle East policy, is not in sight, the German Government will seek above all to maintain the basis of the two-state solution. 
The European Union is providing substantial financial support. Furthermore, due to its experience and competences, it is particularly engaged in working to develop Palestinian sovereignty. 
The State of Israel, founded on 14 May 1948, covers 78 percent of this area; in turn, the Palestinians are seeking an independent Palestinian state in the territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six‑Day War (the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip). 
Germany’s position: two‑state solution through negotiations 
Only a negotiated two‑state solution can meet the legitimate demands of both sides and settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on an enduring basis. 
Germany’s long‑term objective is not just a negotiated settlement to the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict but a comprehensive Israeli‑Arab peace solution which also includes other spheres of conflict in the Middle East: 
The most recent attempt to initiate negotiations between the parties to the conflict was launched by US Secretary of State Kerry in 2013 and 2014. 
The peace process has been stagnating since late April 2014. 
Following on from the Annapolis Conference, the states of the Arab League reaffirmed in 2007 that they would continue their initiative. 
This peace initiative calls on Israel to withdraw to the borders it had prior to the outbreak of the Six‑Day War in 1967. 
The Council conclusions on the Middle East peace process of 16 December 2013 held out the prospect of an unprecedented package of measures for the parties should they reach an agreement. 
High Representative Federica Mogherini has declared that resolving the Middle East conflict will be a priority of her term of office. 
Since 15 April 2015, Fernando Gentilini has been the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process. 
According to media reports, there is fighting in the eastern part of the country. 
They had previously discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine in the Normandy format. 
Most recently, there have been outbursts of artillery fighting in the city of Avdiivka, which is held by government troops. 
Foreign Ministers issue joint call in the Normandy Format 
On the margins of the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Minister Gabriel met with his counterparts from France, Russia and Ukraine in the so-called Normandy format to discuss recent developments in eastern Ukraine.

“We will,” he went on, “meet again in a few weeks to continue working on the next steps in the political process.” 
The Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson, referring to the Minsk peace process, called this “a clear violation of the spirit and objectives of the Minsk agreement”. France, too, criticised this action by Russia. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met with his counterparts in the Normandy format to discuss recent developments. 
After the meeting, the German Foreign Minister said that now, the aim must be “removing and securing heavy weapons from the area and giving the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission the opportunity to monitor where they are”. 
Meanwhile, the Russian government has ordered that documents and identity papers issued in areas occupied by the separatists be recognised. 
The conflict in eastern Ukraine – urging all sides to respect the ceasefire

The agreed ceasefire in eastern Ukraine remains very fragile. 
After both the Ukrainian military and the pro-Russian separatists had confirmed their intention to respect the ceasefire early this week (20 February), there are media reports that new fighting has flared up in the east of the country. 
Violence in eastern Ukraine had previously escalated again early this month. 
The Foreign Ministers issued a joint call for a ceasefire. 
“Without a ceasefire and without the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the political process cannot gain momentum,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said after the meeting in the Normandy format. 
Federal Government criticises recognition by Russia of papers issued in the separatist region 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the current situation in eastern Ukraine 
Alarming reports are reaching us once again today from eastern Ukraine. 
The fact is that the agreed ceasefire is not holding. 
According to the OSCE, heavy weapons were used again last night – and this was the case at several points along the line of contact. 
So far, neither has happened – on either side. 
Even the most intensive negotiation endeavours come to nothing if the political will to implement agreements is lacking. 
At our meeting in the Normandy format on the margins of the Munich Security Conference both sides – Moscow and Kyiv – undertook to use their influence to implement the points agreed by the Trilateral Contact Group on 15 February. 
It also includes informing the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission about the current position data of the heavy weapons so that the observers can monitor their withdrawal. 
Those who make an undertaking on Saturday that no longer applies just a few days later share responsibility for downgrading the negotiating process. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (22 February) on the current situation in eastern Ukraine: 
This includes the withdrawal of heavy weapons and complete adherence to the ceasefire by 20 February. 
We can only call urgently on both sides to now implement the agreed steps immediately. Otherwise, we run the risk of greater military escalation, with a large number of further civilian victims, and a continuation of the standstill in the political process. 
The Foreign Ministers’ talks on Wednesday (22 February) focused on bilateral relations, the future of the EU, and international crises and conflicts. 
This was Sigmar Gabriel’s first press conference in the Federal Foreign Office.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine was also on the agenda. 
On Wednesday (22 February), he met his counterpart Bert Koenders of the Netherlands in Berlin. 
In addition to relations between Germany and the Netherlands, the talks focused on current issues in international politics, particularly the future of the European Union. 
Excellent partnership between Germany and the Netherlands 
“We enjoy closer relations with our neighbour, the Netherlands, than with almost any other country in the world.” 
Gabriel said there was an excellent partnership between Germany and the Netherlands. 
The EU Member States needed to work more closely together in various fields in order to counter the arguments in the debates on nationalism, isolation and right-wing populism. These fields included common foreign policy, Common Security and Defence Policy, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and the development of a strong European single market. 
Gabriel said it was difficult to understand why the ceasefire was still not being upheld and the heavy weapons had still not been withdrawn despite what had been agreed at the last meeting in the Normandy format on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. 
It was now vital to implement the points agreed and to provide the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine with data on the locations of the heavy weapons. 
saying that Germany must become more active in the field of security policy. 
However, a comprehensive approach should be taken here. This should not only focus on military spending. Above all, Germany would increase its activities in the fields of crisis prevention, endeavours to eradicate hunger and poverty, and ways to address the causes of displacement and war. 
Foreign Ministers Gabriel and Koenders have met several times over the past weeks, most recently at the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn. On Wednesday, they met at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. 
The two countries worked closely together not only in the spheres of politics and business, but also at cultural andpeople-to-people level. 
Gabriel said that forces in many European countries were calling the EU, the“greatest civilisation project of the 20th century”, into question. 
NATO: a comprehensive approach 
Foreign Minister Gabriel also spoke about expenditure on NATO,

North Korea’s nuclear programme and repeated missile and nuclear tests pose a serious threat to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and call the global nuclear non-proliferation regime into question. 
The German Government condemned the test in the strongest possible terms. 
Along with the international community, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel condemned North Korea’s conduct in the strongest possible terms. 
Strict sanctions regime 
At the same time, coal exports have been restricted in order to significantly reduce the regime’s sources of income. 
The resolution also includes further travel bans and asset freezes. 
The aim of this strict sanctions regime is to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programme and return to the negotiating table. 
The international community’s aim is to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme. 
However, the talks were discontinued in 2009. 
The German Government nevertheless continues to regard the six-party talks as a suitable format for achieving a solution by diplomatic means. 
In view of the growing threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programme, the German Government will continue to work closely with its partners as regards agreeing an appropriate response to the latest provocation. 
Consensus among the international community in the wake of North Korea’s missile test 
In doing so, it once again violated several United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
The Federal Foreign Office also made the German Government’s disapproval clear during a meeting with the North Korean Ambassador. 
Since 2006, the UN Security Council has been calling on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programme. 
The new restrictions focus on export bans for copper, nickel, silver and zinc.

A joint statement by the Security Council said that the test violated several of its resolutions and that “further significant measures” would be taken against these violations. 
At the same time, it is working with all of its partners on options for creative new solutions. 
With this renewed violation of UN Security Council resolutions, North Korea is breaching the principles of the international community and endangering regional and international security. 
As a result, the European Union has also issued its own sanctions against North Korea several times. These sanctions go beyond those of the United Nations. 
In a meeting with the North Korean Ambassador on 15 February, Germany made its stance on this issue blatantly clear. 
As long as North Korea does not see reason and adhere fully to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, there can be no doubt that the international community will continue to implement the current sanctions in their entirety and that North Korea must expect the sanctions regime to be further tightened. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Syria peace talks in Geneva 
The civilian population of Syria is suffering and has been waiting all too long for this devastating war to finally come to an end. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (23 February) as peace talks for Syria are officially scheduled to begin in Geneva: 
“After nearly one year, there is now a possibility that talks between the Syrian regime and the Syrian opposition will be taken up again in Geneva, with the aim of finding a solution to the bloody civil war. 
For the first time in many months, there is the prospect that the vicious circle of violence may be broken and a true political process can be initiated under the leadership of the United Nations. 
Neither the Syrian regime nor the opposition should let this opportunity pass, although the talks will certainly not be easy. 
In northeastern Nigeria and in bordering countries, millions of people have been affected by attacks of the Islamist terror group Boko Haram. 
The Lake Chad region 
The German Government has been providing humanitarian aid for the Lake Chad region for many years. 
In conducting a missile test on 12 February 2017, North Korea once again violated several United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
UN Security Council resolutions of 2006, 2009 and 2016 prohibit North Korea from launching ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests.

Resolution 2321 (2016), which was adopted by the UN Security Council on 30 November 2016, tightened the sanctions regime further. 
On 13 February, the UN Security Council convened for an emergency session. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel also discussed developments on the Korean Peninsula with various counterparts during the Munich Security Conference. 
The attack on the UN humanitarian convoy at al-Waer again demonstrates how important it is for steps to be taken now to rapidly de-escalate the situation. 
Germany will continue to do everything in its power to support the United Nations, and in particular UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, as they tackle this difficult task.” 
Germany assumes chairmanship of the OSCE Asian Partnership 
Germany’s programme for this year includes five meetings of the OSCE’s 57 participating States at ambassador level with the five partners for co-operation from the Asia-Pacific region (Afghanistan, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand), as well as a large OSCE Asian Conference in June 2017. 
Germany also provides very tangible support for this co-operation. 
The main event of the long-standing partnership, the OSCE Asian Conference, will be held in Berlin on 19 and 20 June 2017. 
The date for the conference was set by the Permanent Council of the OSCE in February. 
Japan became a partner in 1992, followed by the Republic of Korea in 1994, Thailand in 2000, Afghanistan in 2003 and Australia in 2009. 
From the outset, the OSCE Asian Partnership has given its 57+5 countries the opportunity to exchange views and experiences on security in the OSCE region and in partner countries. 
Over the years, partners for co-operation have been included to an ever greater extent in OSCE activities. 
They currently have access to official OSCE documents and are invited to attend important OSCE meetings (e.g. Ministerial Councils) and events. 
They also participate on a regular basis (since 1994) in meetings of the Permanent Council and of the Forum for Security Co-operation. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel calls on all sides to participate in peace talks for Syria

“Neither the Syrian regime nor the opposition should let this opportunity pass, although the talks will certainly not be easy,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said on Thursday evening. 
“I call on all sides to engage seriously and constructively in the negotiations on a political transition.” 
Full support for the UN and its Special Envoy 
Mongolia, which had been a partner country, became a full OSCE member in 2012. 
Relations between the OSCE and its Asian Partners for Co-operation were established in the early 1990s. 
“Germany will continue to do everything in its power to support the UN, and in particular UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, as they tackle this difficult task.” 
Lowered expectations 
However, he hoped that the talks would be productive and move towards a political settlement of the six-year conflict.

New UN-led peace talks for Syria have started in Geneva. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel called on the parties to make use of the opportunity to resume the peace negotiations.

Opportunity must not be passed up 
Speaking in Bonn last week (17 February), Foreign Minister Gabriel underlined that the humanitarian situation in the country remained “catastrophic”. 
“For the first time in many months, there is the prospect that the vicious circle of violence may be broken and a true political process can be initiated under the leadership of the UN”, Gabriel said. 
The talks in Geneva were suspended in April 2016 because of the escalating violence around the city of Aleppo. 
A ceasefire was finally agreed in December 2016, but has proved fragile. 
The dramatic situation in Syria was also a topic on the margins of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn 
Germany holds the chairmanship of the OSCE Asian Partnership in 2017. 
Combating human trafficking and drug trafficking, fighting violent extremism and terrorism, cyber security and disaster risk reduction – all these are security challenges with an impact far beyond the OSCE region. 
Promoting democracy and human rights, regional cooperation, gender awareness, the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and confidence-building measures are additional areas that we and the five Partners for Co-operation from the Asia-Pacific region have a common interest in. 
Discussions so far have not only underscored the current relevance of these issues, but are also proof of the ongoing interest of the OSCE and especially its partners in maintaining a dialogue and sharing information and experiences on these issues. 
For example, the Federal Foreign Office makes available funds for specific OSCE projects with Afghanistan and for partnership projects in general, which include participation by partners in OSCE events and internships for junior diplomats from partner countries. 
He met a smaller group of counterparts on the margins of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting to discuss the latest developments in Syria. 
In the run-up to the talks, de Mistura warned against overly high expectations and said he was not expecting a breakthrough. 
The participants underlined that peace talks for Syria should take place under the auspices of the UN. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on his first official visits to Italy and Austria 
In this connection, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (26 February): 
Aid organisations are, however, finding it difficult to operate, since there have been repeated attacks on aid workers and some regions cannot be reached due to the security situation. 
Humanitarian aid efforts in Africa’s crisis regions enable people to survive in dignity and safety 
Countless families are fighting for survival. 
They are “the biggest donors”. 
If we intend to improve the situation of the people in the long term, then we must have a stronger focus on crisis prevention and stabilisation than to date. 
In Vienna, Foreign Minister Gabriel will have talks with Federal Chancellor Christian Kern and Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, among others. 
In Rome, he is due to meet Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano. 
The talks will focus on bilateral and European issues as well as urgent international crises and conflicts. 
Such steps will only yield fruit if we implement them in close partnership with the African countries. 
The Federal Government is providing humanitarian aid to people in the region, to the tune of more than 65 million euros in 2016 alone. 
Since 2009, between 20,000 and 30,000 people have died in acts of violence perpetrated by the group. 
More than 2.6 million Nigerians have been internally displaced. 
Nigeria’s bordering countries have already taken in more than 750,000 refugees and returnees from northern Nigeria and have declared disaster areas in the border regions. 
Altogether, more than 14 million people in the region urgently require humanitarian aid. 
The greatest need is for food, health care, water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as for help with re‑establishing livelihoods and obtaining shelter. 
These are also the priorities of the Federal Foreign Office’s humanitarian aid for the region, which in 2016 alone amounted to more than 65 million euros. 
Humanitarian assistance helps people who are in need and have been affected by conflicts and disasters secure their survival and build up a livelihood near their original homes. 
Steep increase in humanitarian funding 
The Federal Foreign Office provided a total of over 1.3 billion euros to respond to humanitarian crises around the world in 2016. 
As co‑host of the Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region in Oslo on 24 February 2017, Germany is continuing to urge others to provide political and financial support for humanitarian assistance in the Lake Chad crisis region. 
Germany has increased its support considerably in recent years. 
We doubled our financial contributions to humanitarian crises on the continent once again in the past year 
In particular, Germany is working together with international partners to develop measures to stabilise the region in the long term. 
On Monday, 27 February 2017, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will travel to Austria and Italy. 
Seldom have so many forces been undermining the European Union at the same time – both externally and internally. 
During my talks in Vienna and Rome, I want to discuss with my counterparts how we can strengthen Europe’s cohesion and make the European Union fit for the future. 
That will only be possible if we in the EU pull together and reach durable compromises, also on difficult issues such as how to deal with the refugee and migration crisis. 
In Vienna I will also discuss OSCE matters. 
Having taken over the OSCE Chairmanship from Germany, Austria plays a key role in our efforts to stabilise the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. 
Millions of people have had to flee their homes in the face of the brutal terror of Boko Haram. 
We are facing one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our age. 
“A dramatic humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region” 
It is important to me that we look beyond the present day. 
This fund will help to deploy this aid even more swiftly and in a manner tailored to the needs of the people in the region. 
We have agreed to set up a consultative group together with the co-chairs from Nigeria and Norway, as well as with our counterparts from Cameroon, the Niger and Chad. 
This format is open to further countries and organisations. 
Furthermore, we have also held discussions today on other crisis regions in Africa. 
and have become the second-biggest bilateral donor worldwide. 
Together with his counterparts from Nigeria and Norway, as well as the Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Gabriel invited participants to the conference in Oslo in order to raise funds to help as many people as possible with urgently needed humanitarian assistance. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (24 February) at the Oslo Humanitarian Conference for Nigeria and the Lake Chad region: 
They are hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees in their region and helping them with the little that they have, all the while suffering themselves in the face of extremely difficult living conditions. 
Assistance for 11 million people: 
We must ensure that children are no longer threatened by starvation and help to alleviate their unbearable suffering. 
Gabriel attends Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region 
Germany pledges 120 million euros for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation measures 
It is one of the largest humanitarian crises of the present day: 
What’s your view of the current situation in the Lake Chad region? 
Foreign Minister Gabriel at the press conference in Oslo 
They have left everything behind: 
their villages were plundered, friends and family members killed or kidnapped. 
Women, young people and children are suffering the most. 
We are talking about the very survival of millions of people! 
These people need our help – and they need it right now. 
The terrorist group Boko Haram has been on the rampage in north-eastern Nigeria for many years. 
Millions of people, many of whom are severely traumatised, have fled to the Lake Chad region to escape the violence. 
However, the region is one of the poorest on the continent. 
It does not have the resources to provide for millions of refugees. 
We must not lose sight of the fact that in Somalia or in South Sudan there are millions more who urgently require aid. 
food, safe water and medical care are urgently needed. 
Yet the humanitarian disaster that is looming in the region receives hardly any coverage here. 
There, too, the conditions are almost unbearable. 
To this end, Germany, Norway, Nigeria and the United Nations convened an international donor conference in Oslo. 
In Oslo today, Gabriel, together with his foreign minister colleagues, forged an alliance for more and better coordinated humanitarian assistance in the region. 
I very much hope that other donors will follow our example. 
I would like to ask you about the crisis in the Lake Chad region and the threat that Boko Haram continues to pose. 
In Oslo, Foreign Minister Gabriel pledges humanitarian assistance for Nigeria and the Lake Chad region 
Hundreds of thousands of children are threatened by starvation in the Lake Chad region. 
I was particularly moved today by the speech given by the Nigerian civil society representative that reminded us that it is not the countries with the largest humanitarian aid budget that make the biggest contribution, but rather the people in the Lake Chad region itself. 
I am able to announce today that Germany will contribute a further 120 million euros for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation measures for the Lake Chad region over the next three years. 
With this in mind, we have decided to set aside 20 million euros of our total contribution for projects to support deradicalisation and reconciliation and to strengthen local structures. 
Five million euros have been earmarked for a country-specific fund for Nigeria, which Stephen O’Brien, the Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations, has announced today. 
We will hold regular discussions in order to agree the next steps to counter the basic problems of terrorism, displacement and poverty. 
In view of the dramatic situation in South Sudan, I have decided today that the Federal Government will provide the country with an additional 40 million euros of humanitarian assistance. 
What must the international community do? 
But that is not all. 
Humanitarian assistance in the Lake Chad region 
Germany, Norway, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and the United Nations have formed an advisory group in which they will coordinate their assistance measures on an ongoing basis. 
Germany earmarks 120 million euros 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his Norwegian counterpart Brende 
Speaking in Oslo, Gabriel declared, “We have to act together, and we have to act now.” 
Germany is one of Costa Rica’s principal trading partners in the European Union. 
The funds pledged at the conference in Oslo are to be used to alleviate the most acute needs of the people in the region as quickly as possible. 
Food, water and also education programmes for children and young people are to be provided as emergency humanitarian relief measures. 
Fighting the causes of the suffering 
Initiatives for reconciliation and cohesion are needed to stop the spiral of violence in north-eastern Nigeria. 
To this end, 20 million euros from Germany’s contribution are to be invested in conflict mediation and deradicalisation projects in the region. 
The Federal Foreign Office has increased its humanitarian assistance funds considerably in recent years, including its financial support for Africa. 
Why are the Federal Government’s efforts in the region important? 
What form can these efforts take in the long term? 
In 2016 alone, the Federal Foreign Office was able to double the size of its assistance measures compared to the previous year and thus contributed around 270 million euros for aid projects in Africa. 
Germany is making available 120 million euros in financial assistance and, as co-host of a donor conference in Oslo, mobilised additional international support on Friday (24 February). 
The most basic supplies are lacking: 
The Lake Chad region is traditionally an important hub for business and trade in the countries that border the lake, that is, Nigeria, the Niger, Chad and Cameroon. 
Preventing the most acute suffering 
An international humanitarian initiative is needed to tackle the crisis and prevent the most acute suffering. 
Germany announced its contribution to this assistance today: 
over the next three years, Germany will make available 120 million euros for humanitarian assistance in the Lake Chad region. 
Yet this is about more: 
Germany is working to tackle the root causes of the emergency situation. 
If stable development is to be seen in the long term, the ownership of the local population in the reconstruction process needs to be strengthened. 
Of the 120 million euros that we pledged for the Lake Chad region today, we are therefore earmarking 20 million euros for promoting deradicalisation programmes, supporting reconciliation processes and strengthening local administrative structures. 
Who is most affected right now? 
At the same time, we are also witnessing a greater willingness in the region to bear responsibility for resolving crises. 
That is why we need close partnerships with these countries and with Africa’s regional organisations. 
Together with Norway, Nigeria and the United Nations, we today established a Consultative Group, through which we want to coordinate specific action with countries in the region, to make progress on the fight against terrorism, displacement and poverty, and to support political dialogue among these countries. 
Costa Rica’s principal exports to Germany are bananas, pineapples, coffee and ornamental plants. 
Its main imports from Germany are machinery, chemical products, cars and car parts. 
Costa Rica is a popular holiday destination. 
The Lake Chad region is experiencing one of the most severe present-day humanitarian crises – and the entire world is witnessing the urgency of the situation. 
A bilateral investment protection and promotion agreement has been in place since 1998. 
The region has truly been hit hard in many ways, specifically by terrorism, displacement, drought and food shortages. 
The international community must get together and raise funds for tackling the dramatic humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region, so that people can be saved from starvation. 
We must do more than in the past with regard to crisis prevention and stabilisation, with the aim of denying terrorism a breeding ground. 
millions of displaced persons and refugees who are urgently in need of assistance are living in the Lake Chad region. 
What do you think, for example, about the idea of a “compact with the Lake Chad region”? 
The country’s Gini coefficient is 0.512 (2014). 
This means stability is important, so that the region can find its footing. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region 
There is a greater need than ever for humanitarian aid, and aid organisations must get these pledges so they can plan and effectively do their work. 
The horrific terrorist acts of Boko Haram are poisoning economic and cultural exchange between these countries, are destroying livelihoods and have further hampered development. 
With this in mind, we not only closely coordinate our policy with our European and international partners, but we also seek to engage in a dialogue with civil society. 
Since then, climate protection has evolved into a new priority area of cooperation through Costa Rica’s inclusion in the Federal Government’s International Climate Initiative. 
In addition, Costa Rica is increasingly becoming a key partner and location for regional development cooperation projects. 
Although Costa Rica’s political and economic as well as cultural affinities are largely with the United States, the cultural sector is an important component of German-Costa Rican relations. 
Four partner schools in Costa Rica are members of the Schools: Partners for the Future initiative, which is also funded by the Federal Foreign Office. 
There are special bilateral agreements on academic and student exchanges with various Costa Rican institutions, including the National Council of Rectors (CONARE) and the public Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), as well as with the Confederation of Central American Universities (CSUCA). 
On 24 February 2017, Foreign Minister Gabriel co‑hosted the Oslo Humanitarian Conference for Nigeria and the Lake Chad region. 
I have decided today to make available an additional 40 million euros in humanitarian aid for South Sudan, to reinforce our efforts to overcome the humanitarian crisis there. 
In an interview with the Evangelischer Pressedienst, Foreign Minister Gabriel talks about the humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region and about Germany’s humanitarian efforts there. 
All this is in addition to the money that the EU has made available for the Horn of Africa. 
It was therefore right that the conference was preceded by a forum that brought together 200 civil society organisations to discuss measures for improving the situation in the region. 
We share the desire of many humanitarian actors to achieve long‑term improvement. 
That is why, here in Oslo, I pledged 120 million euros in German aid for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation measures, to be spent over the next three years. 
First, it must do what we have joined forces with Nigeria, Norway and the United Nations to do here today. We have brought together more than 40 international partners at this donors’ conference. 
Human Rights Commissioner welcomes release of Ildar Dadin 
“I was greatly relieved to hear the news that Ildar Dadin’s guilty verdict has been overturned. 
The focus of the talks with his counterparts will be on the future of the European Union and cohesion in Europe. 
Cooperation on refugee and migration issues

Action must urgently be taken to reverse the growing tendency in Russia to block out independent voices from public life. 
As a member of the Council of Europe, Russia has undertaken to guarantee this.” 
Talks on OSCE issues 
I call on the Russian authorities to protect the right to peaceful demonstration enshrined in the Russian constitution and to bring its laws on the freedom of assembly and the freedom of opinion into line with international human rights standards and apply these accordingly. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel will also discuss OSCE issues in Vienna. 
The endeavours to bring about a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine will play an important role in the talks. 
Meeting with his counterparts and Federal Chancellor Christian Kern

Russian citizen Ildar Dadin had repeatedly made public calls for human rights to be preserved, especially the freedom of opinion and the freedom of assembly. 
“Seldom have so many forces been undermining the European Union at the same time – both externally and internally,” said Foreign Minister Gabriel prior to his departure. 
During his talks in Vienna and Rome, he therefore wanted to discuss with his counterparts how cohesion in Europe can be strengthened and how the European Union can be made fit for the future. 
“That will only be possible if we in the EU pull together and reach durable compromises, also on difficult issues such as how to deal with the refugee and migration crisis.” 
Meeting with former Austrian Federal President Heinz Fischer © Kjer/photothek.net 
Germany held the OSCE Chairmanship last year, with Austria taking over at the start of the new year. 
Whereas violations of the right to demonstrate were previously treated as an administrative offence, a sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment may now be handed down in the case of repeated infringements in accordance with Article 212.1 of the Russian Criminal Code. 
He will then travel on to Rome, where he will meet Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano. 
On Monday morning, Foreign Minister Gabriel’s schedule in Vienna will include meetings with Federal Chancellor Christian Kern and Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz. 
Dadin was found guilty of taking part in several peaceful political demonstrations, which had not been authorised by the authorities, from autumn 2014 onwards, for each of which an administrative penalty had been imposed. 
Dadin had accused the prison staff of severe maltreatment in 2016. 
Spotlight on Europe – Foreign Minister Gabriel to visit Vienna and Rome 
There is a Goethe-Zentrum in Costa Rica, at two locations in San José. It offers German courses at all levels leading to the relevant German certificates. 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) runs an Information Centre in San José that conducts bilateral and regional programmes to promote the exchange of lecturers and students (particularly postgraduate students) as well as university cooperation throughout Central America and the Dominican Republic. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will visit Austria and Italy on Monday (27 February). 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will visit Austria and Italy on Monday (27 February), where he will conduct his first official visits. 
A large number of exchange measures are funded with and within the region every year. These include individual scholarships as well as funding for institutional cooperation projects in the field of research and teaching. 
Costa Rica and Germany enjoy a cordial relationship founded on mutual trust. Bilateral relations are untroubled and focus mainly on trade and economic exchange, long-standing development cooperation and cooperation on environmental issues and climate protection as well as cultural, scientific and academic relations. 
Germany enjoys a very positive image in Costa Rica, thanks in part to the country’s well‑assimilated German community. 
In 2015, Costa Rica exported to Germany goods worth USD 444.8 million and imported from Germany goods worth USD 187.2 million. 
Just under 67,000 German tourists visited the country in 2015. 
A bilateral double taxation agreement entered into force on 10 August 2016 and has been applicable since 1 January 2017. 
Negotiations between the EU and six Central American countries – including Costa Rica – on a bi‑regional Association Agreement providing for gradual customs facilitation were concluded in May 2010. 
Costa Rica’s Government ratified the agreement in July 2013. 
The Association Agreement’s trade‑related articles have been provisionally applied vis‑à‑vis Costa Rica since 1 October 2013. 
Eight EU member states have not yet ratified the Agreement, in particular its political and social parts. 
With per capita GDP of USD 11,206 in 2015, Costa Rica now ranks among the world’s middle-income countries. 
The country’s liberal economic policy and the population’s generally high level of education have led to continuing stable economic growth over a period of several years, with the exception of 2009. 
According to official figures, the poverty rate stands at over 20 per cent, including an extreme poverty rate of 6.7 per cent. 
In November 2006, the last new commitments were made in San José as part of "traditional" technical and financial cooperation, which was in the process of being phased out. 
This lessens the impact of the end of bilateral development cooperation, which is only being continued in the context of regional and so‑called trilateral projects. 
As a pioneer of climate-neutral growth – the current Government of President Solís is also continuing to pursue the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2021 – Costa Rica is an attractive partner for Germany in testing new forms and methods of international climate cooperation. 
Cooperation with Costa Rica as part of the Central American Integration System (SICA) focuses on supporting the competitiveness of small and medium‑sized companies, promoting employment and business start‑ups among young people, energy efficiency and energy conservation, protecting biodiversity and reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). 
GIZ also runs a project with the Inter‑American Court of Human Rights to strengthen access to justice. 
Partly in response to the growing U.S. influence, particularly in the mass media, Costa Ricans continue to be interested in European culture. 
An important part of Germany’s cultural work is promoting the German Colegio Humboldt, an International School with a total of nearly 1000 students and kindergarten children, ten seconded teachers and four federal programme teachers. 
The DAAD has a network of contact persons and supports alumni associations in the region. 
In March 2005, a Humboldt Chair was established at UCR to help further intensify interdisciplinary academic exchange. 
In addition, in September 2012 the Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt Special Chair in Humanities and Social Sciences, which is co‑funded by UCR and the DAAD, was set up at UCR. 
A total of around 1800 language courses are booked at the Goethe-Zentrum every year. 
Gabriel is due to arrive back in Berlin late on Monday evening. 
Relations between Costa Rica and Germany 
I hope that this decision will also be interpreted as a message by the judiciary as regards putting an end to the disproportionate action taken by the Russian authorities against the peaceful expression of opinion in the public domain. 
At the same time, all accusations of abuse of prisoners must, as a matter of urgency, be comprehensively and independently investigated and those responsible brought to justice. 
When he was sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment in a prison camp at the end of 2015, this was the first time that the Russian judiciary had applied restrictions on the right of assembly introduced in 2014. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (27 February) on the release on 22 February of Russian civil rights activist Ildar Dadin by the Russian Supreme Court:

Laos – saving the murals of Wat Si Saket in Vientiane 
The Federal Foreign Office has been funding the conservation and restoration of the endangered murals of Wat Si Saket since 2011. 
Germany is continuing its efforts to help Egypt build a modern, democratic state. 
The Federal Government is watching the human rights situation in Egypt closely, with the overall policy aim being to maintain long-term stability. 
Transformation partnership 
At its meeting on 29 November 2012 in Berlin, which was presided over by the two foreign ministers, the inter-ministerial German-Egyptian Steering Committee reaffirmed and further specified the aims of the Berlin Declaration. 
High-level visits 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel visited Egypt three times during his tenure as Federal Economic Affairs and Energy Minister: 
He also gave a speech on religious tolerance at Al-Azhar University. 
Egypt’s Interior Minister Magdy Abdel Ghaffar paid a return visit to Berlin in June 2016. 
Her meetings focused on parliamentary relations and on the issue of human rights. 
Economic relations and development cooperation 
Germany and Egypt enjoy close economic relations, especially in the area of trade. 
Infrastructure projects in which German companies are involved – in the energy sector, for example – are developing positively. 
In October 2016, Bernd Fabritius, Chairman of the German Bundestag Subcommittee on Cultural and Education Policy Abroad, and Heidrun Tempel, the Director for Research and Academic Relations Policy and Cultural Relations Policy, visited Cairo to participate in the inauguration of the new Goethe-Institut building in the Al Doqi neighbourhood. 
However, the import restrictions introduced on account of the shortage of foreign exchange are having a negative effect. 
The reform programme that has been negotiated with the International Monetary Fund is likely to help resolve these problems. 
Egypt’s economic and investment climate has developed positively since mid-2013 but is still not favourable, especially for small and medium-sized companies, because of the existence of a wide range of bureaucratic hurdles. 
I am deeply disappointed by the news from Istanbul. 
Federal Foreign Office comments on the killing of a German hostage in the Philippines 
The Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office has been funding a project to conserve and restore the highly endangered murals of Wat Si Saket since 2011. 
We condemn the murder of this German man in the strongest terms. 
There can be no justification for this terrorist crime. 
A comprehensive conservation and restoration concept was drawn up in late 2013 on the basis of detailed inventories, examinations of damage and its causes, testing of measures and sample sections. Work on the project began in the summer of 2014.

Now a museum and a Buddhist monastery, Wat Si Saket is of particular importance to the Lao capital Vientiane as a major national monument. 
We are profoundly shocked by the inhumane and cruel actions of his kidnappers. 
Built between 1819 and 1824 as a monastery for King Anouvong, it was the only building to survive the Siamese invasions of the 19th century that led to the city remaining uninhabited for 73 years. 
Comprehensive restoration work on the buildings began in 2011, which marked the 450th anniversary of Vientiane. 
Due to current conditions, payment guarantees are generally recommended. 
We extend our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victim’s family. 
Together with the competent Philippine authorities, we will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice.” 
The project is being carried out by the Society for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (GEKE). Andrea Teufel, a trained restorer, is the project manager. 
Increasing trade with Egypt in goods and services and strengthening direct investment in the country depend on sustained political stability and improving the overall conditions for business (competition oversight, corporate taxation, investment protection, infrastructure measures and improving administrative efficiency). 
The Egyptian government’s economic policy currently focuses on extensive infrastructure projects (developing the Suez Canal Area, road and housing construction, increasing electricity production, land reclamation). 
Impetus is, however, also evident in the property sector, manufacturing and the food industry. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the latest developments in the case of Deniz Yücel 
After two weeks in police custody, Deniz Yücel will now be held on remand for an indefinite period. 
This decision is far too severe and therefore also disproportionate. 
These are dramatic times for Turkey, as well as difficult times for German-Turkish relations. 
We are determined to do everything we can to ensure that Deniz Yücel is set free soon and that the proceedings end well. 
The Cairo-based German-Arab Chamber of Industry and Commerce, which is mainly responsible for Egypt, was established 65 years ago and has more than 3,300 member companies. Germany Trade & Invest (gtai) also has an office in Cairo. 
Development cooperation 
Egypt is a key country for German development policy. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement this evening (27 February) on the decisions by the Turkish judicial authorities concerning Deniz Yücel: 
It neither takes into account freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, precious commodities in every democracy, nor the fact that Deniz Yücel handed himself in to the Turkish authorities and has stated his readiness to cooperate fully with the investigation. 
The case of Deniz Yücel drastically highlights the differences which our two countries evidently have when it comes to applying rule of law principles and how we regard freedom of the press and freedom of opinion. 
We have every reason to raise this issue with Turkey and to make our views known in no uncertain terms. 
Along with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the United States, France, the European Union and Japan, Germany is Egypt’s principal development cooperation partner. 
promoting employment to foster sustainable economic development: 
the water sector and waste management: 
In addition to these agreed priority areas, Germany provides funding for projects including the construction of primary schools, industrial environmental protection, administrative reform, supporting Egypt’s Population Council and measures to promote participatory urban development in the Greater Cairo metropolitan area. 
In June 2016, the first meeting of the Bilateral Commission on Development Cooperation was held in Berlin. It was presided over by Federal Economic Cooperation and Development Minister Gerd Müller and Egyptian International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr. 
“There can no longer be any reasonable doubt that the German national kidnapped in the Philippines is indeed dead. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement in Berlin today (27 February 2017): 
Cultural, academic and scientific relations 
Bilateral cultural, academic and scientific relations are essentially founded on the German-Egyptian cultural agreement of 16 October 1960 and the supplementary agreement of 10 April 1984. 
Numerous measures in the cultural, academic, scientific and media sectors are also being conducted as part of the Transformation Partnership. 
There are also numerous private and state partner schools offering enhanced German instruction, and in some cases the German Language Certificate (DSD). 
There are now 30 schools in Egypt belonging to the global network of partner schools (PASCH initiative). 
The Central Agency for Schools Abroad has had a regional office in Cairo since 2008. 
German instruction at the universities is supported by seven DAAD academic teachers and language assistants. 
Project-based efforts in Egypt focus on helping to establish the rule of law and good governance, as well as on promoting political inclusion, employment, a dual system of vocational training, civil society and professional media. 
Following the bomb attack on a Coptic cathedral in Cairo, Volker Kauder, Chairman of the CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group in the German Bundestag, visited Cairo in December 2016. 
Before this, the tourist sector had been hit hard by severe political unrest between 2011 and 2013, as well as by fighting in neighbouring countries. 
Germany’s principal cultural intermediaries have a prominent presence in Egypt and are running projects in the country. 
To this end, on 12 August 2011, the two countries’ foreign ministers signed the Berlin Declaration on German support for democratic change in the country. 
Vice-President of the German Bundestag Claudia Roth visited Cairo for political talks in April 2016. 
However, the debt swap worth up to 240 million euros, which was agreed on in 2011, remains on ice. 
Support for democratic change 
Four German Schools – founded in 1873, 1884, 1904 and 1999 – provide instruction leading to the German higher education entrance qualification (Abitur). 
The Cairo branch of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) was established in 1907. 
In recent years, numerous projects have been funded by the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office. 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has had offices in Cairo since 1960. 
By providing scholarships to more than 2000 Egyptian and German students and researchers every year, it helps to maintain vibrant and strong scientific and academic ties between Egypt and Germany. 
A priority area of bilateral cooperation is climate and environmental protection. 
Here, the German Embassy works together closely with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für International Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the DAAD and Egypt’s Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs. 
The GUC opened a further campus in Berlin in January 2013. 
These scholarships are funded by the Federal Foreign Office and awarded by the German Academic Exchange Service. 
With a current student body of more than 12,000, the GUC is one of Egypt’s best universities. 
In addition, German archaeologists are involved in excavations apart from those conducted by DAI. 
Until funding for the DWZ ran out, it served as the key point of contact for German-Egyptian cooperation in science and research. 
September 2016 
Federal President Gauck attended the inauguration of President Poroshenko on 7 June 2014 and travelled to Kyiv again in September 2016. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel last met his counterpart Klimkin on 18 February 2017. 
Speaking together as Europeans – Foreign Minister Gabriel in Vienna 
His talks focused on the future of the EU. 
Gabriel and his Austrian counterpart underlined that Europe must speak with one voice in order to be heard in the world. 
Bild: vor dem Abflug 
During his talks in Vienna, he therefore wanted to discuss with his counterparts how cohesion in Europe can be strengthened and how the European Union can be made fit for the future. 
Contentious topics must also be discussed, he said. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz © Kjer/photothek.net 
No one lost national sovereignty because of the EU. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel commented as follows today (28 February): 
“Our children and grandchildren will only have a voice in the world if it is a joint European voice,” Gabriel underlined. 
Deniz Yücel turned himself in to the Turkish authorities in Istanbul almost exactly two weeks ago. 
Deniz Yücel did not run away. 
And then, yesterday, a Turkish judge ordered that Deniz Yücel be detained for an indefinite period. 
“We must speak together as Europeans” 
Gabriel’s first meeting in Vienna was with Austrian Federal Chancellor Christian Kern. He then met his counterpart Sebastian Kurz. 
In the light of our firmly held convictions, this decision is not just disappointing, but unnecessary and disproportionate. 
Afterwards, Gabriel said the talks had been pleasant. 
Germany and Austria were two countries with similar views on what defines the European Union. 
On the contrary, joint European sovereignty gave the countries something in return that they did not have at all as individual nations. 
That was why it is all the more important to speak with a joint European voice. 
Working journalists enjoy constitutional protection in the form of freedom of the press and freedom of opinion not just in Germany, but also in Turkey. 
In all measures taken by the state, especially in the context of criminal justice, freedom of the press and freedom of opinion are precious commodities that must be taken into consideration. 
The criminal justice system must not be misused against journalists in any country that claims to be a democracy and to uphold human rights. 
It is important for the Turkish Government to be aware of our position, and not just from newspaper or TV reports, but through direct talks. 
This is not just our conviction. It is a precept shared by Europe as a whole. 
In the course of this conversation we clearly stated our position, and particularly stressed the following three points. 
The treatment of Deniz Yücel clearly highlights the fact that in our two countries significant differences exist when it comes to applying rule of law principles and how we regard freedom of the press and freedom of opinion. 
The outpouring of solidarity for Deniz Yücel is an expression of fundamental values and deeply held convictions. 
It has to be clear to Turkey that these are by no means easy times for German-Turkish relations, and that the Deniz Yücel case is now making everything much harder yet. 
Germany is very keen to see a stable, democratic and economically flourishing Ukraine. 
They know there are differences between the two countries, they are aware of the dangers posed by current developments, but they also know that we are neighbours, and that we will not be able to alter that fact. 
The latest development in the Deniz Yücel case makes matters infinitely more difficult for all those who call for rational conduct, for all those who endeavour to tread the path of understanding in spite of all the difficulties. 
It is a development that snubs well-meaning individuals on both sides and makes work on a rational relationship extraordinarily difficult. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Vienna and Rome on Monday (27 February). 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to Austria on Monday (27 February) for his first official visit. 
Bild: Gabriel mit Kurz… 
We insisted that we should now have full consular access to Deniz Yücel, so that German consular officers will be able to afford him the best possible assistance during his imprisonment in Istanbul. 
I want to say more here, speaking personally. 
He was and remains willing to answer the questions put to him in the investigation. 
For almost two weeks, nothing at all happened. He was not interviewed. No attempts were made to investigate. 
That is why, at my request, State Secretary Walter Lindner today asked the Turkish Ambassador to come to us here in the Federal Foreign Office for talks an hour ago, in order to communicate this clear position face to face. 
The German Government as a whole, and myself personally, are doing our utmost to ensure that Deniz Yücel is released as soon as possible and that a solution is found which is good for Deniz Yücel, for freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, and for German-Turkish relations. 
Our relations are now facing one of their greatest tests of the present age. 
Gabriel in Italy: 
More courage for Europe 
the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano were waiting to meet him in Rome. 
Bild Gabriel mit Alfano… 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his Italian counterpart Alfano 
Gathered in this Renaissance palace, representatives of France, Italy, Germany and the Benelux states signed what came to be known as the Treaties of Rome, and thereby established the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. 
One issue in particular topped the agenda for the talks on Monday between Gabriel and his Italian interlocutors: 
Germany is one of Ukraine’s most important trading and investment partners. 
the challenges for community-wide European policy are tremendous. 
Gabriel und Alfano at the Italian Foreign Ministry 
The principal German exports to Ukraine are machinery, motor vehicles, chemical and pharmaceutical products, electrical goods, foodstuffs and animal feed. 
Ukraine’s main exports to Germany are textiles and garments, metals, chemical products and motor vehicles. 
The Italian Foreign Ministry is located in the Palazzo della Farnesina, the largest building in all of Italy. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with Prime Minister Gentiloni 
Both Foreign Ministers agreed that 
In these difficult times there are people who insist on fuelling confrontation, but there are also many people, in Germany and in Turkey, who are endeavouring to ensure that reason prevails in our relations. 
“Europeans must not abandon one another” 
Europe needs solidarity and must be defended with commitment. 
Germany and Egypt have long maintained close and diverse relations. 
The convening of Egypt’s newly elected parliament in January 2016 marked the end of a period of political transition. Prior to this, a new constitution had been adopted in January 2014 and Abdul Fattah al-Sisi had been elected President in May 2014. 
Launched in August 2011, Germany’s Transformation Partnership with Egypt has laid the groundwork for modernising Egyptian society and bringing about democratic change in the country. 
Joint Declaration of the German-Egyptian Steering Committee, 29 November 2012 (English) (PDF, 56 KB) 
President al-Sisi visited Germany from 2 to 4 June 2015, holding talks with, among others, Federal President Joachim Gauck and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and attending a meeting of the German-Egyptian Joint Economic Commission. 
in March 2015, in August 2015 and most recently in April 2016, to attend the 3rd Meeting of the German-Egyptian Joint Economic Commission. 
Federal Interior Minister Lothar de Maizière visited Cairo in March 2016 for talks on the German-Egyptian Security Cooperation Agreement. 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry visited Berlin from 11 to 13 January 2017. His visit included a meeting with Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
Johannes Singhammer, Vice-President of the German Bundestag, visited Egypt in February 2017, where he met with, among others, President al-Sisi, Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and members of the Egyptian House of Representatives. 
In 2015, bilateral trade grew by approximately 20 per cent compared with the previous year, to 5.2 billion euros. 
This growth is expected to continue in 2016, to a level of approx. 5.7 billion euros. 
The visit to Cairo by Federal Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Gabriel in April 2016, accompanied by a large business delegation, underscored Egypt’s importance for German trade and industry. 
Ministerial Decrees Nos. 911 and 43, for example, list products to which import restrictions apply and declare that products must in principle be imported by an Egyptian partner company. 
The difficult issue of currency control has improved somewhat since the Egyptian central bank floated the country’s currency on 3 November 2016. However, numerous restrictions on the transfer of funds remain in force. 
This move does, nonetheless, provide a sound basis for economic calculations, and the black market for currency trading has been practically closed down. 
Following the devaluation, the price of imports to Egypt has more than doubled (the value of the Egyptian pound has dropped sharply since last November, from 9 to approx. 17 pounds per euro). 
That said, Egypt in principle remains a desirable trading partner and – with certain reservations concerning the public administration’s efficiency – an attractive destination for investment, particularly following the currency devaluation. 
With its unique cultural monuments that testify to its 5000-year-old history, and with its good weather, Egypt is a prime destination for beach holidays and cultural tours. 
Recently, however, there has been a marked decline in the number of foreign tourists, following the crashes of a Russian charter jet over the Sinai peninsula in October 2015 and that of an Egypt Air plane that was inbound from Paris in May 2016. 
In the second half of 2016, there was again a slight increase in the number of tourists visiting the country. 
In addition, there are three other officially recognised German schools abroad (in Cairo, Alexandria and Hurghada) that are still being built up. 
These schools are attended by a total of some 4,500 students. 
The branches of the Goethe‑Institut in Cairo (opened in 1958) and Alexandria (1963) offer extensive language programmes and library facilities as well as organise numerous cultural events. 
In addition, they offer seminars and further training courses in the education and cultural spheres, focusing in particular on the social transformation process in the wake of the Arab Spring. 
There are approximately 900,000 students learning German as a foreign language at state schools in Egypt. 
German departments exist at Al-Azhar, Ain Shams, Helwan, Cairo, Menoufia, Minia, October 6 and MUST-Misr Universities, with a total of around 12,000 students enrolled in teacher’s training and supplementary programmes. 
In addition, the Goethe‑Institut provides assistance to the Egyptian Ministry of Education in training German-language teachers. 
The main focus of its activities is on archaeological excavations at pharaonic sites. It also oversaw the restoration of Islamic monuments in historic Cairo. 
Besides the DAAD, seven German research institutions are represented in Cairo: the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Orient Institut Beirut, the Technische Universität Berlin and the Technische Universität München, the Freie Universität Berlin, Philipps-Universität Marburg and the Central Agency for Schools Abroad. 
During the German-Egyptian Year of Science and Technology in 2007, Germany and Egypt concluded three co-funded cooperation agreements on the funding of additional scholarships. 
The bilateral German-Egyptian Research Fund was set up in 2008 to promote joint research projects. 
This series of events offers a platform for sharing experiences and raising awareness, as well as promoting cooperation between the political, business and scientific sectors and civil society. 
Germany also supports the German University in Cairo (GUC), a private Egyptian university under local law. 
It is funded entirely by private Egyptian investors and through tuition fees but also receives support from the Federal Government and partnered German universities (Ulm, Stuttgart and Tübingen) for its teaching activities. 
In October 2012, the Technische Universität Berlin (TUB) opened a campus in El Gouna on the Red Sea offering five master’s programmes: in Energy Engineering, Water Engineering, Urban Development, Business Engineering and IT for Energy. The DAAD supports the transnational education project by providing scholarships. 
There are currently a total of 19 binational master’s programmes, some of which are still being established, for example in Energy and Energy Efficiency (REMENA, Kassel and Cairo Universities), Integrated Urbanism & Sustainable Design (IUSD, Stuttgart and Ain Shams Universities), International Education Management (INEMA, PH Ludwigsburg and Helwan University) and German as a Foreign Language (Leipzig and Ain Shams Universities). 
New additions in 2013 were the study programme in Heritage Conservation and Site Management (BTU Cottbus, the German Archaeological Institute and Helwan University) and a master’s programme in Comparative & Middle East Politics and Society (University of Tübingen and the American University in Cairo). 
Since 2015, there is also a new master’s in Museum Studies (Würzburg and Helwan Universities). 
During the 2016/17 winter term, GUC, TUB El Gouna and Helwan University each began offering ten scholarships to Syrian refugees. 
Germany has increased its support considerably since 2014. 
German support focuses on the following areas: energy efficiency, sustainable economic development and good governance/decentralisation. 
In response to the situation in eastern Ukraine, Germany is also affording extensive assistance to provide shelter and care to internally displaced persons. 
“There is no reason why we today should have less courage,” Gabriel stated. 
Judiciary and human rights 
For many years now, Germany has supported Ukraine’s efforts to build a sound and stable state based on the rule of law along European lines. 
To this end, the Federal Government is funding legal advisory projects in Ukraine. 
“In tomorrow’s world even the voices of big countries like Germany or Italy will no longer be heard on their own.” 
“There is no reason why we today should have less courage” 
An important player in this regard is the German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (IRZ), which commenced work in the country back in 1991. 
Cooperation currently focuses on constitutional, administrative and criminal law, as well as judicial reform and fighting corruption. 
In addition, Germany is actively involved on a regular basis in multilateral projects such as those conducted by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). 
The focus here is on administrative and commercial law. 
Gabriel spoke privately with Prime Minister Paolo Gentilioni in this sixteenth century palace. 
They, too, focused on cooperation within the European Union. 
Finally, the Federal Foreign Office supports human rights projects in Ukraine, which are implemented by Ukrainian non-governmental organisations. 
After his talks with Angelino Alfano, Gabriel crossed the Tiber to the Palazzo Chigi, the official residence of the Italian Prime Minister. 
“Europeans must not abandon each other – be it with respect to youth unemployment or to migration,” Gabriel said at his joint press conference with Alfano. 
A German-Ukrainian Agreement on Cultural Cooperation was concluded in 1993. 
Gabriel’s inaugural visit to Rome was significant not only because of the special relationship between Germany and Italy. 
As part of the Schools: Partners for the Future (PASCH) initiative, some 40 Ukrainian schools (DSD and FIT schools) and the German school in Kyiv receive assistance in establishing and developing their German language teaching. 
The talks in Rome were significant not only because of the special relationship between Germany and Italy. 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) opened an office in Kyiv in 1998, and an agreement on academic cooperation was also concluded in the same year. 
60 years ago, treaties were signed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill in the heart of Rome, which came to form the foundation of the European Union. 
the future of the European Union. 
Here Foreign Ministers Sigmar Gabriel and Angelino Alfano intensely debated how the European Union could be taken forward. 
Today it contains over 300 large statues of the Buddha from the 15th to the 19th centuries, as well as unique murals from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
When the project began, there was an urgent need to take action, but a lack of expertise on the highly complicated conservation and restoration of the murals in the temple and colonnade. The aim of the project is thus to conserve the murals while training Lao artists in restoration work. 
He noted that back then it was much harder for politicians from the countries devastated by the war to argue for cooperation with neighbours who had so recently been mortal enemies. 
Gabriel stressed that the difficult economic situation in many southern European countries had to be tackled by the European partners in a spirit of solidarity, as did the challenges created by the migration of hundreds of thousands of people to Europe. 
Remembering the Treaties of Rome, signed 60 years ago, Gabriel called for greater optimism and resolve. 
He stressed that it was now more important than ever to campaign resolutely for European cooperation: 
Demand for German language teaching – both in and outside schools – remains strong, as does the interest in DAAD scholarships. 
The number of German learners is constant or on the increase. 
There are more than 160 university partnerships between the two countries. 
In addition, there are numerous school partnerships and town twinning arrangements. 
German-speaking Ukrainian and Ukrainian-born writers in particular are a prominent and integral part of the bilateral cultural landscape. 
German minority 
The most recent census (2001) put the number of German minority members living in Ukraine at approximately 33,000. Most of them are the descendants of German emigrants who settled in what was then the Russian Empire from the end of the 18th century onwards. They have established various groups and associations, and many are active members of Evangelical Lutheran congregations, some of which are served by clergy seconded from Germany. Since December 2004, all the organisations and associations of the German minority have been united under the umbrella of the Council of Germans in Ukraine. 
Germany and Ukraine enjoy a close political dialogue. 
Federal Chancellor Merkel last received President Poroshenko in Berlin on 31 January 2017 while 
Germany’s federal states, cities and municipalities, as well as universities and schools, private associations and individuals also feature prominently in bilateral relations. 
Ukraine still records a marked deficit in its trade with Germany, though this has been trending downwards since 2014. 
Since 2005, questions relating to bilateral economic relations have been discussed by the German-Ukrainian High-Level Working Group on Economic Issues. 
In the same year, the Goethe-Institut opened a branch in Kyiv, whose network now includes German Reading Rooms, language-learning and teaching-material centres and libraries offering inter-library loan services in all regions of the country. 
Upon leaving Vienna on Monday, Gabriel continued on south across the Alps ‑ 
Brexit, the rise of populism and controversies on subjects such as migration and financial policy ‑ 
In between antique sarcophagi and Renaissance tapestries, the ups and downs of Europe’s common history are very much visible in this monumental edifice from the 1930s. 
More than 9000 Ukrainians are currently studying at German universities, and around 1500 Ukrainian students are awarded DAAD grants and scholarships each year. 
In the year 2015 alone, Germany pledged 191 million euros for financial and technical cooperation, as well as for emergency and transitional aid. In 2016, it provided total contributions of 86.5 million euros. 
The Goethe-Institut also oversees three German-Ukrainian cultural associations in Odessa, Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. 
Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
The SADC Secretariat is in Gaborone, Botswana, and the current Executive Secretary is Tanzanian national Dr Stergomena Tax. 
Swaziland took over the year-long SADC chairmanship from Botswana in August 2016. 
It will pass to South Africa in August 2017. 
SADC’s most important decision-making institution is the Summit of Heads of State or Government.

German development cooperation with SADC 
The G7 and G20, as well as the EU, are committed to strengthening regional organisations such as SADC. 
Intensified cooperation with the African Union (AU) and other regional organisations in Africa aims to help promote political and economic cooperation, defuse tensions, integrate fragile states into communities founded on shared responsibility, create larger markets with freedom of movement for labour and capital, remove trade barriers and thus make states more attractive for domestic and foreign investors. 
In addition to its multilateral commitment via the EU, Germany has provided over 350 million euros in support for SADC since its creation in 1992.

and will travel on to Ukraine tomorrow. 
His trip will continue in Kyiv on Thursday and Friday. 
Meeting with counterparts 
The first stop on the trip was the Estonian capital Tallinn, 
where Gabriel met his counterpart Sven Mikser early in the morning. 
Ukraine country profile 
Working together for security – Foreign Minister Gabriel visits the Baltic states 
His agenda in Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius on Wednesday will include talks with his counterparts, meetings on cooperation with media partners and a visit to a NATO base. 
Following his first official visits to Austria and Italy, Foreign Minister Gabriel’s next trip is to eastern Europe. 
His visit is an expression of solidarity with the Baltic states. 
Germany stands resolutely shoulder to shoulder with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on security issues within the framework of its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel with Estonian Prime Minister Jüri Rates 
After the talks, Gabriel met Prime Minister Jüri Rates. The delegation then travelled on to Latvia, 
A large number of German “programme teachers” (teachers working under special central government and federal state programmes), academic teachers and language assistants are working at schools and universities in Ukraine. The Robert Bosch Stiftung also funds academic teachers in Ukraine. 
The Federal Government is assisting Ukraine’s transition to a market economy and its efforts to move closer to European structures. 
In the wake of Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in contravention of international law and in light of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine that has claimed large numbers of victims, Germany is seeking to reach a peaceful settlement of the crisis in close cooperation with its European and international partners, especially within the framework of what is known as the Normandy format (Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia). 
Germany strongly supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity and does not recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea. 
Under the German Bundestag’s International Parliamentary Scholarship (IPS) programme and the High Level Experts Programme of the Federal Foreign Office and the German Embassy in Kyiv, young Ukrainian professionals visit Berlin each year to complete an internship at the German Bundestag, Federal Foreign Office or other institutions. 
In 2015, Ukraine’s economy shrank by 10.6 per cent, mainly as a result of the continued fighting in the east of the country. There were signs that Ukraine’s economic situation was beginning to stabilise last year, however. 
Current estimates for the entire year 2016 forecast economic growth of 2.2 per cent, while GDP growth in the final quarter of 2016 was 4.7 per cent. 
If a lasting cessation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine is achieved and the country’s economic reform agenda – supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union and other international actors – is implemented, Ukraine has a good chance of recording continuous growth in the future (forecasts for 2017 predict growth of two to three per cent), though considerable risks still remain (including a recent temporary deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of falling prices for numerous export goods, Russian economic measures against Ukraine, political uncertainty, corruption, lack of legal certainty and risks within the country’s banking system, as well as recent bottlenecks in the supply of energy and raw materials caused by a blockade of transport routes). The Federal Government is supporting Ukraine’s economic development in a variety of ways, including the provision of an untied loan to the tune of 500 million euros. 
In addition to the services provided by the German Embassy, their interests are looked after by the Chamber of Commerce Abroad established in Kyiv in October 2016, the local representative of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
Acting on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the German Advisory Group advises the Ukrainian Government on questions of economic and social policy. 
Ukraine is among the countries engaged in close economic cooperation with Germany on the basis of intergovernmental agreements. 
Since 2002, Germany has been helping Ukraine to build a democratic state based on the rule of law and to establish market economy structures. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is visiting the Baltic states today (1 March) 
Estonia will take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from Malta in the second half of the year. Gabriel pledged Germany’s support on this and on security issues, 
where meetings between Gabriel and his Latvian counterpart Edgars Rinkēvičs and Latvian Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis are scheduled. 
Later in the day, Gabriel will hold talks in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius with Foreign Minister Linas Linkevičius and President Dalia Grybauskaitė. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel departed for the Baltic states late on Tuesday evening (28 February), and will visit four countries in three days. 
The talks with the Estonian Foreign Minister focused on the future of the European Union 
Their talks focused on the future of the European Union – a topic on which Germany and Estonia are cooperating very closely. 
There is also scope in another two programmes: one on peace, security and responsible governance in the SADC region and one aimed at strengthening regional-national cooperation. 
German development cooperation concentrates on the priorities set forth by SADC in its key development strategies, revised in 2015 – the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) and the Strategic Indicative Plan of the Organ on Defence, Politics and Security (SIPO). 
German development cooperation with Botswana 
Germany supports Botswana in the field of vocational training, as this is a cornerstone for the country’s sustainable economic development ensuring healthy economic diversification and opening up better job opportunities for young people. 
This project is also a pilot in attempts to gradually encourage better-off developing countries – Botswana is an upper middle income country – to fund German technical cooperation support (via GIZ IS) themselves, as 70% of the cost is met by Botswana (Government and Chamber of Mines). 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) is making available 2.1 million euros to finance 12 development workers (up to the end of 2017). 
Uruguay 
Uruguay and Germany have traditionally enjoyed very good relations. 
Federal President Gauck and Ms Schadt paid an official visit to Uruguay from 14 to 16 July 2016. 
There are currently some 10,000 Germans living in Uruguay, including citizens with dual nationality, along with some 40,000 ethnic Germans – 
an unusually large proportion of the overall population. 
Germany also supports Botswana via contributions to multilateral organisations active in the country, such as the EU, the World Bank, UNDP and the African Development Bank, and through its development cooperation with the Southern African Development Community (SADC). 
Germany is also seen as an important member of the European Union and an actor with growing international influence. 
The most important SADC activities in Botswana supported by Germany are a cross-border water resources management project and a programme for the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA). 
Cooperation on security 
Their talks focused on the future of the European Union – a topic on which Germany and Estonia are cooperating very closely. 
underlining its “commitment to common security”. 
Enhancing European coordination 
In 2017 the SES set up the “Weltdienst 30+” programme,

enabling it to include in its register of experts not only retired people but also younger volunteers still active in their careers. 
Gabriel and his Latvian counterpart Edgars Rinkēvičs were in agreement on the development of the Union. 
Europe must be more than simply a strong single market and a free trade zone, they said. 
“We will only be taken seriously in the world as Europeans if we make headway on political cooperation on our continent,” Gabriel underlined. 
Close friendship and cooperation 
At the end of the first day of his trip, Gabriel met his counterpart Linas Linkevičius in Lithuania. 
Once again, the topic of security played an important role in the talks. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel summed up by saying that “security in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania is also our own security”.

The future of the European Union was also the main point on the agenda in Riga, the second stop on the trip. 
European coordination needed to be enhanced in particular with regard to a common foreign and security policy and protecting the external borders. 
Germany and Lithuania are linked by close friendship and cooperation, he said. 
The Federal President, who was accompanied by a large delegation, paid tribute to the 160 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the 100th anniversary of the German-Uruguayan Chamber of Industry and Commerce. 
Since the second half of the nineteenth century, German immigrants have made an important contribution to the country’s development. 
German Mennonite communities emigrated to Uruguay after the Second World War. 
Leading figures in Uruguayan society are well informed about German affairs. 
Of Germany’s political foundations, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung have offices in Montevideo, from where they conduct mainly regional programmes. 
Other German foundations (the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, the Heinrich Böll Foundation and, since 2000, the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation) support various projects without having their own local offices. 
German imports of high-quality Uruguayan meat play a major role here. 
There are currently some 60 German companies operating in Uruguay, 
mainly in the industrial sector, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and the transport and logistics sector. 
German companies generally serve the Uruguayan market through local representatives/partners or through sales offices in third countries, either from their production facilities in Brazil and Argentina or from outside MERCOSUR. 
German companies, as well as German technology and funding, also feature prominently in the renewable energy sector. 
The German-Uruguayan Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Montevideo was founded in 1916 and currently has over 400 members, more than 50 of them domiciled abroad, some in Germany; 
it is affiliated to the regional chamber in Buenos Aires. 
The following bilateral economic agreements are in place: 
There is close cultural and academic exchange between Germany and Uruguay. 
The Ministries of Agriculture of the two countries are working closely together on agricultural research. 
Its German courses are very well attended and demand is constantly growing. 
There is a long tradition of cooperation between universities, research and cultural institutions. 
Cultural exchange is given substance by music and artistic events, measures to promote the German language (Netzwerk Deutsch) and by traditional events organised by the country’s German associations. 
Sports promotion is also an important element of bilateral exchange. 
In 2013, the German School Montevideo was awarded the Excellent German School Abroad quality seal by the Central Agency for Schools Abroad and the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
The school currently has some 1500 students (including kindergarten children). 
German is currently taught as an optional subject at two state schools in Uruguay under the Federal Foreign Office’s Schools: Partners for the Future initiative (PASCH). 
Cultural relations between Germany and Uruguay were institutionalised by a cultural agreement that has been in force since 8 May 1989. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel departed for the Baltic states late on Tuesday evening (28 February), and will visit four countries in three days. 
His agenda in Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius on Wednesday includes talks with his counterparts, meetings on cooperation with media partners and a visit to a NATO base. 
Accompanied by 6 Ministers and 70 business representatives, Uruguay’s President Tabaré Vázquez paid an official visit to Berlin and Hamburg from 7 to 11 February 2017. 
The main priority was to intensify business relations. 
Uruguay offered asylum to German‑speaking Jews from 1935 onwards. 
In 2015, Germany was Uruguay’s principal European trading partner in terms of both imports and exports and thus one of the country’s most important trading partners worldwide, after countries such as Brazil, China and Argentina. 
According to Germany Trade & Invest figures, total German direct investment in Uruguay stood at 341 million euros in 2014. 
According to figures from the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Germany imported goods worth 336 million euros from Uruguay in 2016, 
while Uruguay imported goods worth 320 million euros from Germany. 
A German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) lector has been teaching at the Universidad de la República’s (UdelaR) Faculty of Humanities and Education Science since 2013.

Thanks to its programme of events, the Goethe‑Institut in Montevideo, now in its 50th year, is an established and recognised feature of the Uruguayan capital’s cultural scene. 
Founded in 1857, it is the oldest German international school in Latin America, offering both the German university entrance examination (Abitur) and the Uruguayan equivalent. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visits NATO Iron Wolf barracks in Lithuania 
Another important aspect of the trip is cooperation with media partners in the Baltic. 
This cooperation began in the form of various projects in 2015, and Gabriel used this visit to be brought up to date on their state of implementation. 
Next stop: Ukraine 
Foreign Minister Gabriel arriving at Kyiv airport 
The visit took place at a special time: this year marks the 25th anniversary of Germany and Ukraine taking up diplomatic relations. 
The focus of Thursday’s agenda was on security. In the morning, Foreign Minister Gabriel first paid a visit to a NATO contingent in Lithuania that includes German soldiers. 
After winding up his visit to the Baltic states, Foreign Minister Gabriel on Thursday afternoon travelled to Kyiv. 
In Kyiv, Gabriel met with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin. He also held talks with President Poroshenko and the President of the Ukrainian Parliament. 
After conclusion of the talks, Gabriel is expected to arrive back in Berlin on Friday afternoon. 
Various projects are being funded, for example journalist seminars. The aim is to strengthen independent Russian media outlets in the Baltic states, so that local ethnic minorities can receive their information from professional sources. 
The report by the Commission of Inquiry shows how urgently these severe human rights abuses must end and how important it is that the perpetrators be brought to justice. 
Through bilateral initiatives, Germany is supporting all three countries in their efforts to counter disinformation campaigns. 
The focus of these meetings was the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Both sides used this opportunity to search for ways to implement the Minsk agreements. 
This is another reason why it is important that the negotiations in Geneva be continued and that talks on concrete issues begin as soon as possible.

Those who support the Syrian regime bear a particular responsibility in this regard.” 
Visits to the NATO contingent and to media partners 
Most of the criticism is directed at the Syrian regime and its allies. 
drawing attention to forgotten humanitarian crises 
However, armed opposition groups were also guilty of violations through their indiscriminate shelling of civilians. 
In its report, the Commission of Inquiry notes the severest violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, which it says amount to war crimes. 
Maldives 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the report on Aleppo by the UN Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (2 March) on the report published yesterday by the UN Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic : 
“The latest report by the UN Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic on the battle for Aleppo in autumn 2016 is harrowing. 
It documents the brutality and ruthlessness of the Syrian regime and its allies, which deliberately puts civilians at risk by conducting targeted air strikes on schools and hospitals. 
However, the armed opposition groups were also guilty of serious human rights abuses. 
Moreover, the situation of the people in Syria must finally significantly improve. 
On 2 March 2017, the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic published its report on the battle for Aleppo in autumn 2016. 
Exports to Germany amounted to 4.1 million euros in 2016 (2015: 4.6 million euros), 
key products being food and drink. 
Imports from Germany, primarily machinery, totalled 45.6 million euros in 2016 (2015: 40.83 million euros). 
A Tax Information Exchange Agreement between the two countries entered into force on 12 December 2011. 
Germany has terminated bilateral development cooperation with the Bahamas on account of the country’s high per capita income. 
However, the Bahamas is involved in regional German development cooperation projects with CARICOM. 
As a result of the economic crisis, German exports to Russia dropped by 26% in 2015 compared to the previous year to 21.8 billion euros. 
What are forgotten humanitarian crises?

The country had been a member of the Commonwealth since 1982, but left on 13 October 2016, 
Political parties were only able to establish themselves in Maldives from 2005 onwards, in the wake of a democratisation and reform process. 
In accordance with the constitution, the president is both head of state and head of government and is elected directly for a five-year term. 
Also enshrined in the constitution for the first time is the separation of powers, and thus the independence of the judiciary. 
The parliament (People’s Majlis) is unicameral 
and its members are elected directly. 
However, Wahhabism is playing an increasing role, not least owing to support from Saudi Arabia. 
The legal system also includes elements of British common law, especially with regard to commercial law. 
The Federal Republic of Germany has maintained diplomatic relations with Maldives since 1966. 
The German Ambassador in Colombo is simultaneously accredited in Malé, 
where Germany has an honorary consulate. 
Developing stable democratic structures and the rule of law continues to be a challenge for the young republic. 
Russia’s annexation of Crimea in contravention of international law and its actions in eastern Ukraine overshadow German-Russian relations as well as Russia’s relations with the European Union and other Western partners. 
In response to Russia’s actions, the EU has imposed incremental sanctions on the country (asset freezes and travel bans on individuals and companies as well as sectoral economic and financial sanctions). 
Germany and France in particular have, at the most senior level, pressed for observance of the September 2014 Minsk agreements. 
At a summit attended by Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine in Minsk on 12 February 2015, a package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements was adopted. 
As a result of the low price of oil, its insufficiently diverse economy and the effect of Western economic sanctions, Russia has faced an economic crisis in recent years to which it has responded with a policy of localisation and import substitutions. 
The renewed increase in oil prices since autumn 2016 has lessened Russia's economic downturn. 
Bilateral trade has fallen since 2012 from 80 billion euros to 47 billion euros from January to November 2016. 
Russia’s principal exports to Germany are raw materials, in particular oil and natural gas, as well as metal goods and petrochemical products. 
Germany’s main exports to Russia are mechanical engineering products, motor vehicles and vehicle parts, chemical products, food and agricultural produce. 
Despite the crisis, some 5200 companies with German capital investment have stayed in Russia and are preparing for the economy to pick up again. 
Many regions in Russia, for example the Republic of Tatarstan and the Kaluga Region, are actively seeking to attract foreign investment. 
Incentives are being offered, ranging from the creation of industrial parks and special economic zones to the provision of land, buildings, transport infrastructure and connections to customs and tax concessions and cutting red tape. 
Customs clearance, certification and administrative procedures often still prove difficult. 
There is a lively exchange between Germany and Russia in the cultural and education sectors. 
This led to a further intensification of exchange between the two countries at the level of civil society. 
The aim is to promote German-Russian youth exchange and foster direct dialogue between young people in the two countries through a host of events and encounters. 
As part of the Schools: Partners for the Future initiative (PASCH), more than 100 schools receive support to build and develop their German teaching. 
Here, there is close cooperation between the Central Agency for Schools Abroad and the Goethe-Institut. 
The Goethe-Institut organises a wide spectrum of cultural events and offers a comprehensive range of language courses in Russia, as well as boasting a wide network of partners in Russia’s provinces. 
There are currently more than 880 partnerships between higher education institutions in the two countries. 
In the past year alone, there were more than 15,000 Russians studying in Germany, nearly one in ten of them on a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) scholarship. 
Over 1700 German DAAD scholarship holders have gained experience at universities and research institutions in Russia. 
There are a number of lectors funded by the DAAD and the Robert Bosch Stiftung working at Russian universities. 
The German-Russian Institute of Advanced Technology was opened at the Kazan National Research Technological University in September 2014. 
At this institute, Russian engineering students are taught according to German standards. 
The first students graduated from the institute in summer 2016. 
The Federal Government strongly supports efforts to step up school and youth exchange with Russia. 
To this end, in 2006 it launched the Hamburg-based German-Russian Youth Exchange Foundation together with other partners. 
So far, nearly 100,000 young people from both countries have participated in the projects it has conducted, 
the annual highlight being the German-Russian Youth Parliament, which met most recently in November 2015 in Moscow. 
The Federal Government promotes efforts to preserve the cultural identity of the German minority in Russia (numbering approximately 400,000). 
The work includes language and education as well as social, community-support and other cultural projects. 
Important fundamental freedoms (in particular freedom of opinion, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press) and the independence of national institutions such as the Elections Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Human Rights Commission have been substantially curtailed. 
Consolidating democracy and the rule of law and ensuring respect for and protection of fundamental rights in Maldives are major concerns which the Federal Republic of Germany seeks to further both in bilateral dialogue with the country and along with the European Union. 
Germany also seeks to promote local civil society in Maldives through various projects. 
The assessment is conducted by ECHO, the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations Directorate-General of the European Commission. 
German visitors have played a major role in making tourism the key sector of the country’s economy. 
Jamaica 
Forgotten humanitarian crises are mainly drawn-out crises that generate great humanitarian need but that receive only scant media coverage. 
It means that there is almost no public awareness of these crises as they unfold. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to Ukraine 
Since Jamaica gained independence in 1962, relations between Germany and Jamaica have been friendly and untroubled. 
Jamaica sees Germany as an important international partner and as one of the most influential member states of the European Union. 
However, Jamaica remains a partner of Germany’s regional development cooperation. 
Jamaica’s largest international donor is the EU, whose budget is financed by the member states. 
While trade was relatively balanced in 2015, Jamaica's exports to Germany far exceeded what they imported from the country in 2016. 
With financial support from the Federal Foreign Office, the Jamaican-German Society, which was founded in 1966, offers German language courses leading to a diploma recognised by the Goethe-Institut. 
It also provides support to the German Embassy in organising cultural events. 
There is keen interest in cooperation with German universities and universities of applied sciences. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin 
Immediately following his arrival in Kyiv, Gabriel went to the Foreign Ministry, where he met with his counterpart Pavlo Klimkin. 
This contravenes democratic principles and the European values that the country has undertaken to uphold. 
President Ivanov should reconsider his decision and correct it in the interests of the people of his country. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Ukrainian President Poroshenko 
Today, as well, talks were dominated by the situation in eastern Ukraine and possible steps towards resolving the conflict, Gabriel said after the meeting. 
There must be immediate movement on this issue. 
The discussion with President Poroshenko that followed also centred on the situation in eastern Ukraine. 
Visit to the OSCE mission 
Meeting with civil society representatives 
On Friday morning, Gabriel met with representatives of civil society. 
The escalation of the political situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is very alarming. 
The political stagnation threatens to set the country further back on its path to integration with the European Union. 
President Ivanov is refusing to grant a mandate to the opposition leader to form a government, although the latter has gathered the necessary parliamentary majority behind him. 
Ukraine: country profile 
Germany supports the clear messages conveyed by the High Representative, my friend Federica Mogherini, to political decision-makers and representatives of civil society from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Skopje yesterday. 
On 2 March, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel flew to Kyiv to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine 
I call on all those in Skopje who hold political responsibility to act responsibly even in the currently heated political atmosphere, to moderate their statements, and to do everything they can not to damage relations between the ethnic groups. 
Talks on resolving the conflict, and on economic cooperation 
This has certainly played a significant role in the current escalation of the situation. 
Afterwards, Gabriel visited the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and paid tribute to its important work. 
This trip focused on the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
However, bilateral cooperation beyond the issue of eastern Ukraine was also discussed. 
The organisation is helping to contain the conflict in the affected area, and it is working to reduce tensions between the parties to the conflict. 
German direct investment in Jamaica is negligible, however there is indirect German participation in hotel projects involving substantial investments. 
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established in 1992 and has 15 member states – Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (since 1997), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa (since 1994), Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe – with a total population of just under 300 million. 
In its Federal Government Policy Guidelines for Africa, adopted in 2014, the Federal Government undertook to further strengthen regional integration in Africa. 
In supporting SADC’s integration agenda, German development cooperation also aims to advance the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
To this must be added Germany’s substantial bilateral development cooperation with eight of the fifteen SADC member states – Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. 
The 2015 intergovernmental negotiations largely confirmed the main focuses of cooperation with SADC stipulated in 2009: 
- regional economic integration 
- cross-border water management 
The programmes are implemented by the three implementing organisations GIZ, KfW and PTB, in some instances with co-financing from the EU and the British Government (DFID). 
The aim of the technical cooperation project “Strengthening employment-relevant vocational training” is to tackle one major obstacle to Botswana’s development – the lack of skilled workers – by promoting the establishment and consolidation of dual vocational training courses (approx. 380 trainees in 10 occupations). 
The BMZ also supports the project “Skilled Workers for Africa” implemented via the German Engineering Federation (VDMA); this is a cooperation project with Orapa Training Centre (operated by the semi-state-owned diamond firm Debswana) aimed at modernising the training of mechatronic technicians. 
Up to 16 volunteers are currently in Botswana under the “weltwärts” programme, working in schools and kindergartens, and with orphans, children in need of protection and children with disabilities. 
In addition, the Senior Expert Service (SES) regularly sends volunteers to Botswana – skilled workers and managers who have retired or are taking a sabbatical. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in the FYR of Macedonia 
Speaking on the margins of his visit to Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (3 March) on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 
We firmly support the country’s further integration with the European Union, and very much regret that the unresolved question on the country’s name has prevented faster progress on the path to such integration for years now. 
First joint visit 
Andreas Michaelis and Nicolas de Rivière after their meeting with the National Security Council 
In view of the world’s trouble spots, Europeans cannot afford to be disengaged. 
The Franco-German tandem is important for Europe 
Both Political Directors gave speeches on the future of Europe and the transatlantic partnership and afterwards engaged in discussions with experts. 
After having visited Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Foreign Minister Gabriel on Thursday (2 March) travelled on to Kyiv, where he met with officials to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine and the implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
Bild Gabriel Gespräch mit Klimkin… 
The visit took place at a special time, because Germany and Ukraine are marking 25 years of diplomatic relations. 
Gabriel has already visited Ukraine numerous times in his functions as Minister for the Environment and later for Economic Affairs. 
The two Ministers’ most recent meetings had been on the fringes of the Munich Security Conference and in the Normandy format. They had used these opportunities to discuss implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
Bild Gabriel mit Poroschenko… 
After negotiating a ceasefire following heavy fighting around Avdiivka in January, the members of the mission have, among other things, helped repair important power and water supply lines, as well as alleviate suffering during the cold winter months. 
This will be followed by talks with leaders of the parliamentary groups of the Verkhovna Rada. He is expected to arrive back in Berlin in the afternoon. 
Visit by Franco-German tandem to the United States 
The German-Russian youth exchange year began in June 2016 under the motto “70 Years After the End of the Second World War – Youth Exchange – Understanding – A Common Future”. 
The Russian Federation 
At the same time, the Federal Government has repeatedly made it clear that the door to a dialogue with Russia remains open and that it actively and emphatically supports efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
The relatively weak rouble and drops in wage costs are currently helping to make the Russian market more attractive. 
Many companies have remained in the hope of recouping the losses they made due to the crisis. In 2016, there were signs of a slight upturn in German-Russian trade relations, including German direct investment in Russia which increased to 2.2 billion US dollars in the first half of the year. 
German companies are concerned about the political climate in Russia, the country’s economic development and protectionist tendencies that continue despite Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization also given Russia’s localisation policy and that negatively influence foreign companies. 
Quite apart from this, doing business in Russia requires circumspection and careful consultation on account of the country’s many idiosyncrasies. 
Following the bilateral German-Russian Year of Education, Science and Innovation 2011/2012 and the Year of Germany in Russia/Year of Russia in Germany 2012/2013, crossover years of language and literature, featuring numerous events, were held in Germany and Russia in 2014 and 2015. 
Finally, a joint German-Russian youth exchange year was officially launched in June 2016. 
With some 1.5 million learners, 1.1 million of them school pupils, German occupies an undisputed second place in foreign language teaching in Russia, after English. 
In the keynote speech he gave at the Ural Federal University in Ekaterinburg in December 2014 and most recently at an event with students of the same university in August 2016, Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier emphasised that the two countries had built a good foundation for academic relations and called for efforts to further expand cooperation in this area. 
A Franco-German tandem visit to the United States: 
It was not only with regard to efforts to achieve peace in eastern Ukraine that Michaelis and de Rivière emphasised that the United States is “an important partner”, one with whom they seek continued close cooperation. 
Between January and November 2016, the decrease slowed considerably to only -0.8% compared to 2015. 
Pursuing continued close coordination 
Visit concludes with a discussion about the future of Europe 
Michaelis and de Rivière wound up their visit by participating in an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. 
The Political Directors of the German and French foreign ministries have conducted a joint trip to Washington. 
With their visit, they underscored the need for a strong Europe. 
German Foreign Minister Gabriel and French Foreign Minister Ayrault: a strong European Union for a bright future (press release of 1 March 2017) 
Michaelis emphasised that the time has come to take concerted action. 
This is the right answer, they stressed, at a time when the world order is being reshaped. 
With this in mind, Michaelis, de Rivière and the US side agreed to continue their exchange at the level of experts. 
the Political Directors of the German and French foreign ministries, Andreas Michaelis and Nicolas de Rivière, have made a joint trip to Washington, DC, for official talks. 
The first joint trip by the two Political Directors (from 28 February to 2 March) was not only a visible sign of the very close cooperation between France and Germany, for example on transatlantic issues. 
Their numerous talks with US government representatives and experts focused, among other things, on the stance vis-à-vis Russia, developments related to NATO and the relationship between the EU and the United States. 
In their talks at the Department of State, with the National Security Council and in the United States Senate, the two Political Directors stressed the special role of the Franco-German tandem for cooperation in Europe, in addition to making the case for a strong Europe.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the Syria negotiations: 
With German support: 
disarmament of rebels in Colombia begins 
On 24 November 2016, after more than 50 years, the Colombian Government and the FARC rebels agreed on a peace accord. 
Germany is actively engaged in promoting long‑term peace in Colombia. 
This connection stems from friends and family, many trips, and countless encounters and memories. 
So what can we do? 
On 24 November 2016, after more than 50 years, a peace accord was achieved between the Colombian Government and the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) rebels. 
Bilateral development cooperation (worth a total of approximately 255 million euros) was terminated in 2003, Jamaica having become a middle-income country in terms of per-capita earnings. 
With a share of around 20 percent, Germany is the biggest contributor. 
In 2016, German imports from Jamaica, primarily metals and beverages, were worth 1.02 billion euros ( 2015: 54.584 million euros) and German exports to Jamaica, first and foremost machinery, motor vehicles and parts, amounted to 52.18 million euros (2015: 53.225 million euros) (both figures from the Federal Statistical Office). 
In 2016, some 21,000 German tourists visited Jamaica (figures from the Jamaica Tourist Board) meaning Germany remains in fourth place among the countries of origin (United States 1.4 million, Canada 372,000, UK 106,470).

Should Turkish politicians be allowed to campaign in Germany? 
And mutual respect means moderation – 
including in a campaign and on both sides. 
German-Turkish friendship is stronger than the diplomatic tensions we are currently experiencing. 
Now the priority is to provide compensation for the victims, regulate land restitution and create economic prospects for the rural population and the urban poor. 
The friendship between Germany and Turkey is too close to allow lasting hatred and incomprehension to arise from differences of opinion on political issues. 
In view of the many trouble spots around the world (e.g. Syria, Ukraine, Yemen), it was also an opportunity to closely coordinate policy with the United States on other important political issues. 
“I remain a friend of the Turkish people, both in Germany and Turkey” 
Other challenges include tackling criminal violence, integrating former combatants into society and restructuring the security sector. 
Guest article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in “Bild am Sonntag” (5 March 2017) 
The demobilisation phase is under way 
The intention is for this first joint visit to initiate more close coordination on important foreign policy issues between France and Germany, on the one hand, and the United States, on the other hand. 
“Basta Ya!” 
– humanitarian aid efforts focus on the forgotten crisis in Colombia 
The joint visit – which they used, among other things, to underscore the need for a strong Europe – also demonstrated the close friendship between Germany and France. 
But we cannot allow the foundations of the friendship between our countries to be undermined. 
But I am very concerned that the close friendly relations between so many people in both countries could deteriorate. 
Ceasing our criticism of the developments in Turkey is certainly not an option. 
1 December 2016 marked the start of the six-month demobilisation phase. 
The aim is that the FARC rebels will first gather in designated disarmament zones and will then hand over their weapons under the observation of the United Nations.

While the door may not yet be wide open, it is more than just ajar. 
which is particularly vulnerable to the potential impact of climate change: 
The fact that the Syrian Government continues to block the supply of humanitarian aid to besieged opposition territories is and remains a scandal. 
It is estimated that in the course of the disarmament process, around 14,000 rifles and pistols as well as around 6000 other weapons such as mortars and grenades will be seized and destroyed. 
The UN mission will take responsibility for these tasks. 
Maldives has set itself the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2020. 
Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (3 March) on the conclusion of the latest round of the Syria peace talks in Geneva: 
Its observers are responsible for the registration, identification, storage and constant monitoring of the weapons and are developing an appropriate strategy for destroying explosive ammunition and arms. 
Under the peace accord, the demobilisation process should be concluded after 180 days, by around the end of May. 
Support from Germany 
UN observers are monitoring the weapons and developing a strategy for destroying explosive ammunition.

The public practice of other religions is not permitted. 
Neither religious freedom nor the prohibition of discrimination against other religions is enshrined in the constitution. 
While he was there, he pledged Germany’s financial support for the peace process, visited one of the disarmament zones in the conflict region in person and met with both parties to the accord. 
The promised support has now been implemented. 
The fact that it was impossible to achieve more is down to the obstinacy and delaying tactics of the Syrian regime. 
Germany is providing the United Nations with a total of 500,000 euros for the disarmament process in Colombia. 
The state education system comprises primary and secondary schools. 
As a neutral actor in the three-party mechanism, the UN mission has an important role to play in building confidence between the rebels and the Government and ensuring that both sides comply with the agreement.

Besides the public Maldives National University, the country has three private universities (Cyryx College, Mandhu College and Villa College).

Moscow and Tehran have a responsibility to exert their influence more strongly than to date in order to ensure that Damascus ceases to deliberately pass up the chance to engage in genuinely serious negotiations. 
The seriousness of purpose and willingness to engage in genuine negotiations exhibited by the Syrian opposition sends an important and positive signal, namely 
that it is an illusion to think that it is impossible to break the apparently compelling logic of violence. 
no breakthrough, but minimum objective reached 
A breakthrough has yet to be achieved. However, our minimum objective, keeping the door open to a political process, was reached. 
The project “Crónicas Desarmadas”, which the German Embassy in Bogotá is supporting, provides a special insight into the disarmament process. 
A specially created website features portraits of people from the disarmament zones and the surrounding areas. 
The stories told on the website convey a very real impression of the challenge that establishing long-term peace after such a long conflict presents. 
Our relations with Turkey are currently being put to a severe test. 
At a time when these relations seem to be dominated by what separates us, it may be difficult to underline what unites us. 
I feel a profound connection to this wonderful, yet sometimes difficult, country. 
Our experience of détente policy teaches us to adopt a firm position and to express it clearly. 
This position is the rule of law, freedom of opinion, the protection of human rights, and democratic order. 
Burying channels of communication is not a way to conduct politics! 
But we also have to stand up for Deniz Yücel. 
And even if criticism is necessary, we must not allow ourselves to be fooled by those who want to take their anger out on German-Turkish relations as a whole for all the wrong reasons. 
We are well advised not to use the difficult topics that stand between us as grounds for retaliation. 
Those who want to speak here do not have to agree with us, but they must respect our rules – 
I would like to thank Staffan de Mistura for his tireless and unceasing commitment and the level-headed way in which he conducted the negotiations in what is a truly difficult situation. 
Ensuring that the ceasefire, which has been repeatedly infringed by the Syrian air force in recent days, is observed is also vital.

Maldives gained independence from the United Kingdom on 26 July 1965. 
feeling itself unfairly treated by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and the Commonwealth Secretariat, both of which had been following political developments in Maldives with concern. 
In a referendum held on 18 August 2007, the people of Maldives opted for a presidential system modelled on the US constitution. 
The country’s new constitution, which was drawn up on this basis, entered into force in August 2008. 
The Maldivian legal system is based on Sharia law and follows the Shafi’i school of law within Sunni Islam. 
Maldives opened an embassy in Berlin in September 2016. 
The country had previously maintained relations with Germany via its mission to the European Union in Brussels. 
Particularly since late 2013, national and international observers have been complaining about increasing structural weaknesses in the Maldivian judicial apparatus, about the judiciary’s politicisation and lack of independence and about a generally inadequate division of competences between the country’s constitutional organs. 
Tourism is by far the countr’s largest economic sector. 
It contributes around 29 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for more than 60 percent of foreign exchange earnings and over 38 percent of revenue from taxes and duties. 
More than 106,000 German tourists visited Maldives in 2016, which means that Germans continue to constitute the second-largest group of foreign visitors (8.3 percent), behind the Chinese (25.2 percent) and ahead of the UK (7.9 percent). 
Every year, the island nation has a high-profile presence at ITB Berlin, the World’s Leading Travel Trade Show®. 
Maldives was ITB Berlin’s official partner country in March 2016. 
Bilateral trade was worth 55 million euros in 2015, with German exports to Maldives amounting to 31.8 million euros and Maldivian exports to Germany 23.2 million euros. 
Germany is working with Maldives on international climate policy, a major issue for the island nation, 
80 percent of its territory lies less than a metre above sea level. 
Until July 2015, as part of its International Climate Initiative, the Federal Environment Ministry supported this ambitious goal by funding a project to promote renewable energy which was implemented by experts from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). 
The state religion in Maldives is Islam, the promotion of which is a key government concern. 
Saudi Arabia, like Maldives a member state of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), provides substantial financial support for the country’s education sector by donating books, building schools, awarding grants and scholarships and funding the Maldives Islamic University. 
Saudi Arabia is currently building the largest mosque in Maldives, which will include a library and event halls. 
Maldives has a literacy rate of 98 percent. 
In 2015 and 2016, the Embassy in Colombo supported the “Katti Hivvaru” festival in Malé.

Website of the #nichtvergesser campaign 
Bärbel Kofler, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, is patron of the campaign. 
The Federal Foreign Office has launched the #nichtvergesser campaign. 
The campaign seeks to inform and calls on everyone to think about this topic. 
The #nichtvergesser campaign brings these forgotten humanitarian crises back to the public’s attention. 
The campaign seeks to inform and calls on everyone to think about this topic. 
What is the goal of the #nichtvergesser campaign? 
“The lack of media interest is a severe problem. 
Who is behind the #nichtvergesser campaign? 
Yet the fate of those who are suffering often gets very little media coverage. 
The public relations campaign is also directed at political decision-makers, for in addition to humanitarian aid, political commitment is absolutely essential for resolving the conflicts that are at the root of most crises. 
The campaign is designed to raise the political and public profile of this issue, which is necessary to bring forgotten crises back into the public eye. 
The Federal Foreign Office is jointly organising and implementing this campaign with a number of German humanitarian organisations: Johanniter Emergency Service, the International Department of Caritas Germany, Plan International, SOS Children’s Villages, Welthungerhilfe, Malteser International, Humedica, CARE Deutschland-Luxemburg e.V., Help – Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and arche noVa. 
Bärbel Kofler, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, is patron of the campaign. 
A particular priority is to inform young people such as pupils and university students about the issue of forgotten humanitarian crises. 
The campaign team develops material for youth groups and schools for this purpose. 
High-impact public events are designed to get a broad audience involved in the process. 
The crises in Yemen (civil war and food scarcity) and in Myanmar (persecution of ethnic minorities), as well as in Colombia (internal displacement due to the armed conflict between the army, rebels and paramilitary fighters) and in Western Sahara (refugees in Algeria) are notable examples of forgotten humanitarian crises. 
In the Forgotten Crisis Assessment, forgotten crises are assigned index values on an annual basis and according to standardised rules. 
Some of these regions have been affected by crises for several decades. 
Further topics on the agenda included the latest developments in the Western Balkans, relations between the EU and Egypt, and migration. 
Talks with the Egyptian Foreign Minister

Germany in favour of strengthening EU security and defence policy 
Following the joint session of the defence and foreign ministers, Gabriel said: 
at which he and the EU Foreign Ministers discussed the political developments and economic reforms in Egypt, as well as the country’s role in the region. 
Tensions have recently increased in the region, posing a threat to the positive achievements of the past years. 
Gabriel and his counterparts also discussed the state of play of the Middle East peace process. 
Federal Foreign Office condemns North Korean missile launches 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (6 March): 
We condemn this action by the regime in Pyongyang in the strongest and clearest possible terms. 
These tests are an irresponsible provocation and clearly infringe the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. 
but the missile and nuclear programme also poses a threat to security and stability beyond the region. 
The Federal Government stands united with all of its partners in its condemnation of these tests. 
Moreover, we will issue a clear reminder to the North Korean regime that such irresponsible playing with fire will lead to ever greater international isolation. 
“Once again, North Korea has tested a number of ballistic missiles. 
With its actions, the regime in North Korea is not only endangering our partners in the region – especially Japan and South Korea – 
As the Permanent Mission is not open to the general public, no special measures have been implemented to facilitate disabled access to the building. 
You are therefore advised to inform us in advance of visits by persons with limited mobility so that any necessary preparations can be made. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met his counterparts at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday (6 March). 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his European counterparts at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday (6 March). 
The ministers also discussed the outlook for an enhanced joint European security policy that takes the needs of all partners in Europe into account and strengthens Europe as an actor. 
As recently as last week, and “in view of growing internal and external threats”, Foreign Minister Gabriel and his French counterpart Ayrault called for the EU’s role as a foreign policy actor to be strengthened and for a joint EU defence policy. 
“I think we have achieved a first major step towards a stronger joint European defence and security policy.” 
Germany will support and further the strengthening of Europe, also in foreign, security and defence policy, he added. 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry also attended the meeting, 
Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, conducted in-depth talks with the countries of the Western Balkans last week, and reported to the Foreign Ministers on these meetings. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel has spoken by telephone with his Macedonian counterpart about the politically tense situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and underlined expectations with regard to a democratic solution. 
Their discussion included the question of how cooperation in a spirit of partnership along the migration routes can be expanded.

We will continue to engage in close dialogue as to further steps to be taken and will call for the pertinent sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations Security Council to be implemented even more rigorously. 
In view of the collision course that North Korea is on against the international community, a further tightening of UN sanctions continues to be on the table.” 
Europe needs the strong and clear voice of Spain 
Following the release of the last political prisoners on 22 August 2015 and the non-violent and non-repressive nature of the presidential elections on 11 October 2015 and the parliamentary elections on 11 September 2016 (regardless of the ODIHR election observation mission’s legitimate criticism of the preparation and conduct of the elections), there are new prospects for political and economic dialogue between Germany and Belarus. 
In addition, Minsk deserves credit for the part it has played in international efforts to reach a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis. 
The Minsk Forum, which since its establishment in 1997 has become the largest German-language platform for dialogue between Germany, the EU and Belarus, was held again in Minsk – for the first time after a five-year break – from 24 to 26 November 2016. 
He went on to say that he would like to see Spain, an important partner, play an even more active role in current issues on the future of Europe. 
In many areas the two countries hold common positions, such as their particular emphasis on the rule of law and their focus on shared values. 
“Spain’s amicable and close contact with Morocco benefits the whole of Europe,” Roth emphasised. 
Even during times of crisis 
Deputies from all parliamentary groups underlined how much Spain benefited from a common Europe. 
The colleagues at the Mission will be happy to assist you. 
We will introduce you to the team at the Permanent Mission in more detail on the following page.

The politico-military dimension: 
Forum for Security Co-operation 
Minister of State Roth talking to students from the Complutense University of Madrid 
Minister of State for Europe Roth at the Complutense University of Madrid 
General security policy issues such as arms control and confidence-building measures are discussed in the forum. 
Nothing less than Europe’s future was the focus of the lively discussion with students from the Complutense University of Madrid. 
He said that in this context particularly, young Europeans were called to get to know and understand their neighbours better through student exchanges, for example. 
Minister of State Roth emphasised that against the backdrop of anxiety, crisis and rising populism in large areas of Europe, cutting ourselves off and retreating into national shells was the wrong way to deal with globalisation.

Representatives explained that in many countries, persecution was routine and people were subjected to violence and imprisonment because of their sexual orientation. 
The German Minister of State also learned from representatives of the Fundación Secretariado Gitano during the last stage of his trip to Madrid that the number of Roma with little or no school education was much higher than average. 
Minister of State Roth felt that this was an exemplary contribution to protecting minorities in Europe, as he highlighted at the conclusion of the meeting. 
The Foundation supports the “gitanos” in Spain by means of its diverse social and housing projects as well as through numerous campaigns designed to challenge wide‑spread social stereotypes. 
In February 2017, the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Austria’s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, appointed Germany’s OSCE Ambassador Eberhard Pohl as Chair of the Informal Working Group that is promoting this dialogue.

Germany is accordingly Belarus’ fourth largest trading partner, behind Russia (51% of total foreign trade), Ukraine (7.4%) and China (4.4%). 
The #nichtvergesser campaign: 
Violent conflicts and an increasing number of natural disasters have led to a situation in which currently more than 128 million people in 33 countries around the world require humanitarian assistance to survive. 
Figure illustrating low media coverage of forgotten crises 
So-called “forgotten humanitarian crises” are mainly drawn-out crises that actually require a large humanitarian response, but that receive only little media coverage, as well as insufficient aid and donations. 
As a result, these regions receive practically no donations,” Verena Götze of Johanniter Emergency Service explains, who is responsible for coordinating the campaign on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. 
The aim of the #nichtvergesser campaign is therefore to draw more public attention to forgotten humanitarian crises and to promote humanitarian engagement, with a view to addressing them. 
The campaign’s strategy and instruments 
The initiators hope, by the summer of 2018, to have collected the signatures of 100,000 citizens and supporters who choose to speak out against forgotten crises. This petition will then be handed over to a high-profile figure, such as UN Secretary-General António Guterres, urging him to do more to address forgotten crises. 
The talks also centred on further developing exchange on the Maghreb countries. 
Spain’s economic development was one of the dominant issues during the meeting with the members of the European Affairs Committee. 
The traditional highlight of German cultural engagement in Belarus are the German Culture Weeks, co-organised each autumn by German cultural and educational organisations and their Belarusian partners as well as the German Embassy. They are invariably well received. 
Also something of a tradition is the participation of the German Embassy and the Goethe-Institut in the Minsk International Book Fair that is held each February. 
It brings forgotten, drawn-out humanitarian crises back to the public’s attention. 
We are paying particular attention to the link between the OSCE’s strategic policy documents and operative project work. 
Interest is so great that the term Energiewende has found its way into the vocabulary of many different world languages. 
This is a source of great pride for us. 
With the travelling exhibition on the Energiewende and this website, we want to explain to you what the energy transition is all about, what milestones have been achieved and what challenges remain. 
A key platform for dialogue in this area is the Security Committee, which meets in Vienna on a regular basis. 
Relations between Germany and Belarus have traditionally been close at the level of civil society. A large number of private German initiatives are providing humanitarian aid to help ease the suffering caused by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, the effects of which are still being felt nearly 30 years later. 
Numerous German non-governmental organisations are working for reconciliation with Belarus, which was particularly hard hit by both World Wars. 
The German Government is providing support to a wide range of civil society activities in this area, for example the Trostenets Memorial. 
The Minsk opening of a touring exhibition on Trostenets, jointly designed with Belarus, will take place on 13 March 2017 as a contribution to a shared European culture of remembrance. 
While there, he met his new opposite number, members of the European Affairs Committee of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate as well as civil society representatives. 
The Minister of State for Europe was in the Spanish capital Madrid on 2 and 3 March for a two‑day visit. 
During a two‑day visit to Madrid, Minister of State Roth met his new opposite number, members of the European Affairs Committee of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate as well as civil society representatives. 
He also held discussions with students from the Complutense University of Madrid. 
It was the first visit of the German Minister of State for Europe since the new Government was formed at the end of 2016. 
After his meeting with the Spanish Secretary of State for the European Union, Jorge Toledo Albiñana, Minister of State for Europe Roth declared, “Europe needs the strong and clear voice of Spain.” 
They said that the upswing, particularly the reduction in unemployment, now needed to reach all sections of the population. 
They said that the gay African migration initiative had set itself the goal of raising awareness and helping victims. 
J. Alberto Puertas 
Spain remains pro‑Europe 
Deputy Pablo Casado Blanco stressed that even during times of crisis, Spain had remained a pro‑European country, and pointed out that in Spain there was no major right‑wing populist party. 
The situation of homosexual African refugees was the focal point of a meeting with representatives of civil society organisations working to promote LGBTI rights. 
Around 700,000 Roma live in Spain. They can count on support from numerous municipalities. 
Despite this, around 60 percent of Roma in Spain still live below the poverty line. 
Of importance for relations between people in both countries are the 22 German-Belarusian town twinning arrangements, many of which are complemented by school partnerships. The Johannes Rau Centre for International Education and Exchange (IBB) – a joint German-Belarusian project – has been operating in Minsk since 1994. Its aim is to provide a place of encounter, reconciliation and dialogue. The centre is engaged in wide-ranging and civil-society-oriented intercultural education and exchange work in the political, economic, historical, media, ecumenical, environmental and social sectors with a view to helping promote democracy and the rule of law. 
We will mark 25 years of renewed diplomatic relations on 13 March. 
Hardly any other topic in German politics attracts as much international interest as energy policy. 
With the energy transition, Germany is pursuing an ambitious path to an energy policy which is more secure, affordable and sustainable. 
After all, the energy transition also means more international networking to secure more sustainable energy supplies. 
Belarusian exports to Germany were worth USD 1.09 billion (a decline of 34.3%) and Belarusian imports from Germany USD 1.39 billion (a 43.8% drop). 
In 2014, bilateral trade had been worth USD 4.08 billion, or 5.3% of the country’s total foreign trade. 
Trade between Germany and Belarus slumped sharply, to a mere USD 2.47 billion last year, thus accounting for 4.4% of Belarus’s total foreign trade. 
About us 
At the same time, we are seeing time and again that a number of questions and misunderstandings persist around the world. 
The exhibition and this website were devised by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in cooperation with the communications agency edelman.ergo on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Travelling exhibition "Energiewende - Germany's Energy Transition" 
On that day, a touring exhibition about the Trostenets extermination camp will open in Minsk as a joint project between the two countries. 
A major exhibition of works by Ernst Barlach and Käthe Kollwitz is scheduled to be shown in the National Art Museum in Minsk in the autumn of 2017. This will be the biggest German exhibition in Belarus since independence. 
In the area of economic affairs, this ranges from trade facilitation and transport to the fight against corruption. 
Topics such as water management, disaster risk reduction, waste management and climate change are core focuses in the area of the environment. 
This is in addition to issues relating to energy security as a cross-cutting topic in which the OSCE focuses on the protection of critical infrastructures in particular. 
Human rights and fundamental freedoms 
Moreover, current country-specific developments are often discussed in the Permanent Council. 
Regional issues 
Budget and personnel issues 
A further focus are the extrabudgetary projects with which Germany is supporting the OSCE’s work. 
Protocol and public relations 
The protocol/press team is responsible for our mission’s various public relations instruments and the team leader is also the mission’s spokesperson. 
Important channels include direct contact with journalists, as well as the mission’s website and our Twitter channel @OSCE_GER. 
The Ambassador is supported by a committed team from Germany’s Permanent Mission to the OSCE that covers the OSCE’s broad field of activity in various different units. 
The team at the Permanent Mission and its various fields of work 
Colonel Carsten Rogat, General Staff, is the Military Adviser to the mission. 
The Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC), which meets on Wednesdays, is one of the centrepieces of the OSCE alongside the Permanent Council. 
The FSC also promotes the exchange of information relating to military matters among the OSCE participating States. 
The structured dialogue on current and future challenges and risks to security in the OSCE area has been a particularly important part of this field for us since the OSCE Ministerial Council in Hamburg in December 2016. 
Cyber security is becoming increasingly important in addition. 
Germany has a keen interest in strengthening the OSCE’s ability to act in these areas. 
The Joint Consultative Group, which meets in the Hofburg, coordinates the implementation of the CFE Treaty. 
The Treaty on Open Skies establishes the framework for aerial observation conducted by a security alliance “from Vancouver to Vladivostok”. 
A broad range of topics is addressed in this dimension. 
Close dialogue with representatives from the private economy has been promoted especially since Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2016. 
Cultural and educational exchanges 
German-Polish relations are of eminent importance for both sides and since 1989 have developed a dynamism unparalleled in recent history. 
In the coalition agreement, the Federal Government has agreed to “further strengthen our partnership with Poland and develop the diverse relations with our neighbours.” 
In addition, thousands of German-Polish civil society events were held to mark the anniversary. 
Mutual high-level visits are very frequent. 
The Federal Chancellor’s most recent bilateral visit to Warsaw on 7 February 2017 received a great deal of attention in Poland. 
Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski paid his first visit to Berlin on 26 November 2015, a few days after taking office. 
Federal Minister Gabriel met for initial talks with his Polish counterpart in Brussels shortly after taking office and will travel to Warsaw on 8 March 2017 for his first official visit. 
Since 1991, Poland has been working together closely with Germany and France as part of the Weimar Triangle. 
Within this framework, trilateral talks are held regularly at different levels. 
The most recent meeting of the foreign ministers of the Weimar Triangle took place on 28 August 2016 in Weimar to mark the group’s 25th anniversary. 
Regional and cross-border cooperation, hundreds of town twinning arrangements and the partnerships between German federal states and Polish voivodeships also testify to the breadth and closeness of relations between the two countries. 
The two countries’ economies are closely interlinked. 
For more than two decades, Germany has been Poland’s most important trading partner by far. 
More than a quarter of all Polish exports go to Germany. 
The intense exchange between the two countries in the cultural and education sectors is fostered at the institutional level by cultural intermediaries like the Goethe-Institut, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German-Polish Youth Office, as well as by political and private foundations and a close-knit civil-society network. 
223 political meetings were held to mark the 2016 anniversary, including five Foreign Minister meetings, four meetings of the Heads of State, and three meetings of the Heads of Government. 
Video text: BM in Ukraine 
Our bilateral relations are extremely good. 
Unfortunately, the situation in eastern Ukraine always dominates our talks, of course: the Russian Federation’s annexation of Crimea in contravention of international law, the intervention in Ukraine, the military confrontations there. 
Likewise worthy of mention is the work of the three autonomous OSCE institutions: 
the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODHIR), the Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) and the High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM). 
Shared interests in many areas and the two countries’ trustful partnership in the European Union and NATO provide a sound basis for relations. 
German-Polish intergovernmental consultations are held on a regular basis. 
In 2016, Germany and Poland celebrated the 25th anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation. 
This is in addition to regular meetings of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel with Prime Minister Beata Szydło, mostly in the framework of the EU in Brussels. 
Poland’s Prime Minister Beata Szydło paid her first official visit to Berlin on 12 February 2016. 
Poland is also of considerable importance for German foreign trade. 
Poland’s main exports to Germany are motor vehicles, machinery, furniture, household appliances (white goods and television sets) and food. 
In terms of both the number of investors and the total amount invested, German companies rank first among foreign direct investors in Poland. 
Aggregate German direct investment in Poland since the country’s change of political system in 1989-1990 stands at approximately 30 billion euros. 
On top of this are the investments of less than 1 million euros by small and medium-sized companies, which do not appear in official statistics. 
A number of such investments have been made, especially in the border regions. 
Most German investments are greenfield investments, only a small portion being made through takeovers or in connection with the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. 
German companies are also investing increasingly in technologically advanced manufacturing and services and are expanding their research and development activities in Poland. 
In addition, hundreds of schools, universities and scientific societies are engaged in a wide range of activities in this area. 
The 2016 anniversary was marked by a wide range of events showcasing the quality and importance of this network. 
The work of the principal German intermediaries in Poland is based on the German-Polish cultural agreement of 14 July 1997, which entered into force on 4 January 1999. 
Nowhere in the world do so many people learn German as a foreign language as in Poland – well over two million at Polish schools alone. 
Offering measures to support the learning of German is one focus of German foreign cultural policy in Poland. 
There are 108 Polish schools partnered with schools in Germany. 
20 seconded teachers from Germany teach German in Poland alongside their Polish colleagues. 
Levels I and II of the German Language Certificate (DSD) of the Standing Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany are awarded at 98 partner schools there. 
In Warsaw, students at the Willy Brandt School, the German School and the German-Polish Binational School can take both the German university entrance examination and the Polish equivalent (Matura). 
The Federal Foreign Office supports projects in the realms of music, film, literature and the visual and performing arts as well as cultural, historical and civic education measures for young Germans and Poles. 
Since 1993, German and Polish historians have been working together at the German Historical Institute in Warsaw, mainly on topics relating to Germany and Poland’s shared history. 
The German-Polish Youth Office (GPYO), set up in 1991 by an intergovernmental agreement, promotes encounters between German and Polish youth and school groups as well as trilateral projects together with third countries. 
In the years since 1991, the GPYO has supported encounters between more than 2.5 million young people. 
The GPYO is co-funded by Germany and Poland. 
Between the late 1950s and 2015, the DAAD provided funding enabling more than 70,000 Polish and 27,000 German scientists and academics to pursue research in the partner country. 
Various German-language study programmes at Polish universities, the Viadrina European University, which was re-founded in Frankfurt/Oder in 1991, and the programmes offered by the Neisse University, the Universities of Rostock, Greifswald and Wismar, the International Graduate School Zittau and the Centre for Polish Studies at the Universities of Halle-Wittenberg and Jena all serve to intensify mutual academic and cultural exchange. 
In addition, the Max Planck Society, the German-Polish Science Foundation, the German Research Foundation, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation work together with Polish partner organisations. 
The German minority in Poland numbers between 300,000 and 350,000, according to its own estimate. 
However, the 2011 census put the number at 148,000, though this figure is questioned by the German minority because of the methods used in the census. 
Many members of the minority have German as well as Polish citizenship. 
The German minority is the largest of the country’s 13 recognised national or ethnic minorities. 
Most of the minority organisations belong to an umbrella organisation (the Association of German Social and Cultural Societies, VdG) based in Opole. 
The rights of the minorities are guaranteed in the Polish constitution and the German-Polish Treaty on Good Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation of 17 June 1991. 
In January 2005, a Minorities Act entered into force that also provides for the use of minority languages as second languages at local level and the putting up of bilingual place name signs. 
The German minority is increasingly making active use of this option in its main settlement area. 
The German minority is currently represented by a deputy in the Polish parliament. 
At regional level, it is a strong political force in Opole voivodeship and part of the regional government there. 
Its candidates have won several seats in regional elections and numerous seats in district elections as well as winning a municipal council election and several mayoral elections. 
Ambassador Eberhard Pohl heads up the Permanent Mission and represents Germany in the OSCE Permanent Council, which generally meets in the Vienna Hofburg each Thursday. 
Germany’s efforts in the FSC domain are overseen by a diplomat seconded from the Federal Foreign Office, as well as by an officer seconded from the Bundeswehr. 
CFE and Open Skies also fall within the remit of the politico-military dimension. 
Thirty-four states currently meet on a regular basis in a Consultative Commission and in working groups in order to translate this treaty into reality. 
Thanks to the decision reached by the 57 participating States at the Ministerial Council in Hamburg in 2016 to strengthen good governance and promote connectivity, the OSCE was able to inject fresh and strong momentum into this field. 
In so doing, Germany sets priorities that further its political agenda to promote human rights in the world. 
Key areas here include the crisis in and around Ukraine, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the crisis in Georgia, as well as the process to resolve the Transdniestria issue in the 5+2 format. 
General legal issues and matters relating to the OSCE’s legal personality are likewise part of the team’s remit. 
We can look back on 25 years of joint relations and are also bound by our support for the reform process. 
I think we would all be much happier if we could channel all our energy into doing what people in Ukraine, regardless of where they live, expect: helping to build a flourishing country with prosperity, social security, better environmental conditions, better health protection and everything that Ukrainian policymakers have undertaken to achieve – and what should really be the focus of our joint efforts. 
Interview by Foreign Minister Gabriel with the “Gazeta Wyborcza” newspaper 
Embargoed until 10.00 a.m. (CET) on 8 March 2017 
You visited Tallinn before Warsaw. 
Why? 
Is Poland no longer important for Germany? 
That is certainly not the case. 
By the way, I have lost count of how many times I have been in Poland. 
Poland is not only a close neighbour for me, but also one of the most important partners in Europe. 
I am proud of what we have achieved and put in place since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
The West has rebuked Russia for infringing international law in Ukraine, where the conflict has claimed thousands of victims. 
At the same time, Germany is constructing a second Nord Stream gas pipeline. 
Isn’t that something of a contradiction? 
Europe needs all its strength for the recalibration of the world that we are currently experiencing. 
Why do you not react when fundamental European values are violated? 
We would welcome an open, honest and constructive dialogue between the Polish Government and the European Commission. 
Interview by Foreign Minister Gabriel with the Polish newspaper “Gazeta Wyborcza”, published to coincide with his visit to Warsaw on 8 March 2017 
Since then, it is no longer politicians who make decisions about the gas supply, but European companies. 
Politicians are responsible for enforcing the right regulations. 
We are doing this in Germany, 
and also with respect to Russia. 
So far, all German Foreign Ministers visited Poland very shortly after taking office. 
German-Polish relations have never been as good and close as they are today. 
Poles can rightly be proud to have such a vibrant civil society. 
Aren’t you concerned that your resistance is weakening NATO? 
Are you taking objections raised by Poland into account in this matter? 
We therefore take the concerns that have been raised in Poland very seriously. 
“The roots of the friendship between Germany and Poland are incredibly strong” 
One reason why I recently visited all three Baltic states was because the larger EU Member States, particularly Poland and Germany, need to show the smaller members that they are important. 
Apart from that, it is important to come to Warsaw before I visit Russia. 
I first started visiting your country during the 1980s, when Poland was still under martial law. We wanted to have contact with Solidarność and we regularly met people in the Catholic Intellectuals Club in Warsaw. 
And I visited Poland several times last year in my capacity as German Minister for Economic Affairs. 
But more importantly, 
the roots of the friendship between Germany and Poland are incredibly strong. And these roots unite us and give us a firm foundation, no matter how turbulent the situation might be above ground. 
That moved me deeply. And it also convinced me 
that people in Poland and Germany do not need political symbols to proclaim the value of their relations. 
We are working hand in hand to become even closer. 
This is also important as regards cohesion in the European Union. 
The EU has launched a rule of law dialogue, but is limiting it to an exchange of correspondence with Warsaw. 
I admit that we are concerned about some of the developments. 
After all, Europe is not merely an economic union, but rather a community in which the same rights, values and democratic principles should prevail. 
We also recognise that there is a spirited debate in Polish politics and society. 
Are you considering such ideas? 
I want to work well and in a spirit of mutual trust with my counterpart Witold Waszczykowski. 
Before you became Foreign Minister, you advocated lifting the sanctions on Russia that were imposed following the annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. 
Unfortunately, the situation remains as complicated as ever. 
Regrettably, there can be no talk of significant implementation. 
The Crimea sanctions have nothing to do with that – they were imposed because of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. 
Gas pipelines do not only transport Russian gas to Germany, but also to Poland, of course. 
Other major German-Polish institutions like the Foundation for Polish-German Cooperation and the German-Polish Youth Office were also celebrating their 25th anniversary that year. 
However, the question that we must all ask ourselves is how can we prevent gas from being used as a political instrument against Europe. 
This has been clearly communicated to Russia as a prerequisite. 
Moreover, we must join up the European gas network more strongly so that outages of an original source can be replaced by another source at any time. 
However, we ask people to understand that we want to stand by the liberalisation of the gas supply undertaken in Europe years ago. 
The country now ranks eighth among Germany’s trading partners. 
Under the Trump administration, the US is threatening to scale back its commitment to NATO if Europeans do not increase their financial contribution. 
You recently said that achieving the two-percent target for defence expenditure was unrealistic. 
In 2014, we reached a firm agreement in NATO to aim to move towards the two-percent guideline for defence expenditure within a decade. 
The branches of the Goethe-Institut in Warsaw and Cracow, with additional reading rooms and partner libraries, and German-Polish cultural societies in major Polish cities are active in providing information and organising cultural programmes and language courses. 
We stand by that, and this is what we are doing. 
Germany is taking a leading role in all of the reassurance measures in eastern Europe adopted by the alliance. 
Our work in these areas needs to be just as decisive. 
The members of the German minority live mainly in Upper Silesia (more than 80 percent of them in the voivodeships Opole and Silesia). 
The aim of my first visit is to show how important Poland is for us and that we can trust each other. 
I am aware of the dark chapters of our two countries’ history, of Germany’s guilt and of the time needed to heal the major wounds, without ever forgetting the past. 
This includes listening to each other and conducting an honest dialogue where our positions diverge – that is part of a good friendship. 
Have you changed your opinion in your new role? 
Our position remains that 
if truly good and tangible progress is made in implementing the Minsk agreements through Moscow’s active participation, then we should think about gradually easing the sanctions that were imposed in connection with Russia’s actions in eastern Ukraine. 
I do not know anyone who would demand or even consider lifting the sanctions that were imposed against Russia because of Crimea. 
as European values, not relations between Warsaw and Berlin, are involved. 
However, I believe that Brussels is the right place for the rule of law dialogue, 
A year ago, your predecessor Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he did not even want to think about the idea of imposing sanctions against Poland for violating the rule of law. 
High points in the celebrations were the joint opening of the German-Polish Forum by the two countries’ Foreign Ministers on 19 April 2016 in Warsaw, mutual visits by the two countries’ Presidents (Polish President Andrzej Duda visiting Berlin on 16 June and Federal President Joachim Gauck visiting Warsaw on 17 June) and the German-Polish intergovernmental consultations on 22 June in Berlin. 
The principal German exports to Poland are chemical products, petroleum, machinery, electronic goods, motor vehicles and vehicle parts. 
In this regard, it is important that we safeguard both the transit pipeline through Ukraine, as well as Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland’s interest in the Yamal pipeline. 
The year marking the 25th anniversary of our Treaty on Good Neighbourliness was an excellent example, with over 200 political meetings and thousands of events organised by members of the public from our two countries. 
The aim of my first visit to Warsaw as Foreign Minister is to tap into this trust while I am here. 
The Polish Government has undermined the Constitutional Tribunal and taken over state media. It is planning to amend local electoral law and it is attacking the Supreme Court. 
Particularly in view of our shared history, I am grateful that we are now more closely united as friends than perhaps we have ever been. 
Security, however, is about more than taking stock of military equipment; above all, it is about security policy dialogue, conflict prevention, work to stabilise fragile states, development policy and humanitarian aid. 
BM Statement TUR 
I expressly welcome the fact that my Turkish colleague travelled to us here in Berlin for our meeting. 
And, with this in mind, it was good that we also met for face-to-face talks here today. 
I personally have, for many years and decades, always been most interested in Turkey and also in the people from Turkey who live here, and I always found the fact that there is a long-standing and great friendship between our peoples to be remarkable. 
Turkish people in Germany in particular have become important bridge-builders in Turkey, and I believe that, for all of the difficulties that we have today, we must call to mind the great successes of this friendship and cooperation in the efforts to rebuild our country. 
Recalling these good relations is important because they are currently so strained. Moreover, this also demonstrates that this is not normality – normality is better than the current state of affairs, and returning to this better normality is a desire that both I and my Turkish counterpart share. 
While our meeting today was good, honest and friendly, it was also tough and not without controversy. 
This is the freest country ever to have existed on German soil. 
Of course, the Turkish side also pointed out that it too wished to be treated with respect. I believe that both sides bear responsibility for this, and there are simply red lines that must not be crossed, and this includes comparisons with Nazi Germany. 
I believe that – no matter how we view Turkey’s position or how the Turkish side interprets our position, no matter how great the differences may be – there is no alternative to talks, because this is the only way for us to stand a chance, step by step, to return to normalised and indeed friendly relations between Turks and Germans. 
We must call to mind the cultural, artistic and economic successes that Turkish people have achieved in Germany and which Germans have achieved in Turkey. 
We are one of the freest countries in the world, and I believe that accusations of the sort that we heard in recent days must not be allowed to be repeated. 
We are therefore emphatically committed not only to his release, but also that of the other imprisoned journalists. 
the rules of law and decency. 
This also applies to political campaigning. 
I am sure that the Turkish side sees this in exactly the same way and understands that we are committed to the principles of the rule of law and respect. 
A fair, honest and open partnership and also friendship between our two countries must be our objective. 
Turkey has been a major destination for German tourists for many years. It has lost some of its attraction owing to concerns about security in Turkey, however. 
I myself travel to the country on a regular basis and was there as a tourist last year. 
And I know that many people have good relations with one another and do not want this to be harmed by politics. 
People from Turkey have played an incredible part in building up our country’s prosperity. 
We have been the beneficiaries of riches in the area of culture and sport, as well as in the economy. 
And this is how we also want to see ourselves. 
They should be citizens of our country enjoying equal rights wherever this is not yet the case. 
That isn’t important. 
I am sure that we will achieve this. 
I strongly advocated taking care not to weigh up mistakes or different topics against each other, but to look at matters on a case-by-case basis – this applies especially to the imprisonment of the German-Turkish (Turkish-German) Deniz Yüksel. 
I made it clear once again that we believe that the Turkish judiciary must respect the principles of a fair trial under the rule of law and that we consider being held on remand for an indefinite period to be wrong and unreasonable. 
However, above all, we wish to be granted the consular access to him that the Turkish Prime Minister pledged to the German Chancellor a few days ago. 
It is clear that those who want to speak here will always encounter a country that is committed to the freedom of expression. However, it is also important in Germany to abide by the rules – 
We agreed that we intend to continue our dialogue as quickly as possible. 
Only talks such as those we held today can help to normalise relations step by step. 
namely that we actually have solid foundations. 
I believe that, in spite of our political differences, we must never allow political conflicts to be imported from Turkey to Germany. 
Much of what we enjoy today would have been unthinkable without the help of Turkish employees, businesspeople and companies. 
That means that they are part of our country. 
However, above all, we want to show that we have great respect for their help and their work to rebuild this country. We want to tell them this: 
Perhaps not the country that you come from; perhaps not the country where you believe that your cultural roots lie. 
They should know that we will do our utmost to prevent conflicts that occasionally exist between countries or in other countries from driving Germans and Turks in Germany apart. 
Allow me to come back to what I said at the beginning of my remarks, 
People from both of our countries are acquainted with each other. What is more, the ITB Berlin opens today. 
However, we in this country want to live well and peacefully and that we settle our disputes in a democratic way, that we do not treat anyone in a disrespectful manner, and that they can always count on the friendship of the Germans. They should know that we are glad to have them here and that they should stay and help to develop this country. 
Federal Foreign Office condemns attack in Kabul 
“We condemn the attack on the military hospital in Kabul in the clearest and strongest possible terms. 
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families of the victims. 
The terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility. 
It is cowardly and callous to target defenceless individuals in a hospital. 
We stand side by side with the people of Kabul at this difficult time and continue to support Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism. 
“No alternative to talks”: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel meets Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu for talks early on Wednesday morning (8 March). 
Difficult topics were on the agenda, including the constitutional referendum in Turkey and appearances by Turkish politicians in Germany prior to this, as well as the imprisonment of journalist Deniz Yücel. 
Growing tensions in German-Turkish relations had recently been the subject of a great deal of discussion, Gabriel continued. 
He said that both Ministers agreed that 
neither side had an interest in inflicting long-term damage on German-Turkish relations but that, 
on the contrary, it was their common desire to return to a better phase in relations. 
“There is no alternative to talks”, Gabriel concluded. 
“This is the only way for us to stand a chance to return to more friendly relations.” 
Following his talks, Gabriel emphasised that 
We have discussed the growing tensions between Turkey and Germany, and also, unfortunately, within the Turkish community in Germany, on a number of occasions in recent days. 
At our meeting, we have, of course, talked about all manner of difficult and, for the most part, also controversial topics, and about the different opinions on the referendum as well as the imprisonment of Turkish and also of a German journalist and about open consular questions. We have also repeatedly discussed the issue that is the appearance of Turkish politicians here in Germany in the context of the campaign for the referendum. 
He said that Germany was one of the world’s freest countries, also with respect to the freedom of the press and the freedom of opinion. 
”It is clear that those who want to speak here will always encounter a country that is committed to the freedom of expression”, Gabriel emphasised. 
Helping Deniz Yücel 
“We want to live well and peacefully in this country” – Gabriel giving a statement to the press following the talks 
This attack on defenceless hospital patients, on the sick and the injured, as well as on the staff that help these people, demonstrates the barbarity of this terrorist group. 
In this connection, Gabriel reiterated that the Federal Government was emphatically committed to the release of Deniz Yücel, a journalist at the “Die Welt” newspaper who has been held on remand since last Monday. 
Moreover, he said that it was important for Germany to be granted consular access to Yücel swiftly, as had been pledged to Federal Chancellor Merkel. 
“The people have become bridge-builders”, he said – firm foundations for re-establishing good relations with each other. 
In closing his remarks, the Minister sent a message to all people with Turkish or dual citizenship in Germany: 
“This is your home country. 
We want to live well and peacefully with each other in this country.” 
an open and honest dialogue is needed 
Gabriel with his Turkish counterpart Çavuşoğlu: returning to a better phase in relations 
After talks with his Turkish counterpart, the Foreign Minister said that their meeting “was good, honest and friendly”, but also “tough and not without controversy”. 
Çavuşoğlu had himself spoken in Hamburg on the previous evening. 
The Minister had difficult issues in his in-tray on Wednesday (8 March), including the constitutional referendum, appearances by Turkish politicians in Germany and the journalist Deniz Yücel. 
Freedom of expression and the rule of law 
comparisons between present-day Germany and the National Socialist past such as those made in the context of debates surrounding the appearance of Turkish politicians in Germany would not be tolerated. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on tour: first official visits to Warsaw and Moscow 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Poland on Wednesday (8 March), and continued on to Russia. 
This was the first time Gabriel had visited either country as foreign minister. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Poland on Wednesday (8 March) for talks with his Polish counterpart Witold Waszczykowski. 
He thereafter continued eastwards to Russia. 
This was Gabriel’s first visit there as foreign minister. 
On the occasion of International Women's Day on 8 March, the Federal Foreign Office sends a clear message for women's rights. 
In Warsaw on his first official visit, Foreign Minister Gabriel spoke to his Polish counterpart Witold Waszczykowski about German-Polish relations. 
Foreign policy needs strong women! 
Around the globe, the Federal Foreign Office is engaged in promoting the rights of women and girls. 
A central place in the German Government’s human rights policy is reserved for the protection of women and the improvement of their human rights situation. 
“The roots of the friendship between Germany and Poland are incredibly strong. And these roots unite us and give us a firm foundation, no matter how turbulent the situation might be above ground.” 
“We now need to pool all our resources in order to be in a strong position during the next ten years. 
Europe needs all its strength for the recalibration of the world that we are currently experiencing.” 
On 8 March, the United Nations Day for Women's Rights and International Peace, female diplomats in Berlin and throughout the world sent a clear message.

Full interview given by Foreign Minister Gabriel to the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met with his Polish counterpart in Warsaw on Wednesday (8 March). 
In the Federal Foreign Office's Protocol Courtyard, where state visitors and ambassadors normally drive up, female colleagues came together and created a human chain in the form of the symbol for women. 
State Secretary Lindner with Federal Foreign Office employees 
“Women change the world for the better,” State Secretary Lindner declared, speaking on International Women's Day. 
The work of the Federal Foreign Office, too, thrives on the dedication and competence of qualified and highly motivated women. 
Efficient and committed 
“With this in mind, it was good that we met for face-to-face talks today”, he said. 
This would only be possible if both countries engaged in an open and honest dialogue with one another. 
At the same time, he added, the rules must be abided by – “the rules of law and decency”. 
Gabriel said that Germany and Turkey were united by a remarkable friendship, particularly at the people-to-people level. 
“In spite of any differences we may have, we must not allow conflicts to be imported from Turkey.” He said that people of Turkish origin had made a major contribution to prosperity in our common country in the area of culture, sport and the economy. 
Women's rights and Germany's engagement 
Despite all the difficulties we have today, 
At our meeting, we, of course, talked about all manner of difficult and, for the most part, also controversial topics, and about the different opinions on the referendum as well as the imprisonment of Turkish and also of a German journalist and about open consular questions. We also repeatedly discussed the issue that is the appearance of Turkish politicians here in Germany in the context of the campaign for the referendum. 
We agreed that neither side has an interest in inflicting long-term damage on German-Turkish relations and that we will only be able to master the tests that we currently face by engaging in a sober and respectful dialogue with one other. 
our meeting today was good, honest and friendly as well as open, it was also tough and not without controversy. 
I reiterated most clearly that comparisons with the Nazi period and railing against democracy and the rule of law will not be tolerated in Germany. 
I made it clear once again that we believe that the Turkish judiciary must respect the principles of a fair trial under the rule of law and that we consider being held on remand for an indefinite period to be wrong and unreasonable. 
We are therefore emphatically committed to his release and the release of the other imprisoned journalists. 
The Turkish Prime Minister made this pledge to the German Chancellor a few days ago. 
It is clear that those who want to speak here will always encounter a country that is committed to freedom of expression. 
However it is also important in Germany to abide by the rules, namely 
the rules of law and in equal measure the rules of decency, even during an election campaign. 
We agreed that we intend to continue our dialogue as quickly as possible. 
Only talks such as those we held today can help step by step to bring us back to better relations, to a fair, honest and open partnership. 
I myself travel to the country on a regular basis and was there as a tourist last year. 
I know that many people have good relations with one another and do not want this to be harmed by politics. 
At the end of my remarks, I would like to send a message to those from Turkey with dual citizenship and those with Turkish citizenship in Germany. 
Regardless of our political differences, we must never allow political conflicts to be imported from Turkey to Germany. 
People from Turkey have played an incredible part in building up our country’s prosperity. 
This means that 
Above all, we want to show that we have great respect for their help and their work to rebuild this country. 
We want to tell them this: 
Perhaps not the country that you come from; perhaps not the country where you believe that your cultural roots lie - that does not need to be the case. 
The Federal Republic of Germany established diplomatic relations with independent Tajikistan in 1992. 
However, it is our wish that we in this country live well and peacefully together, that we settle our disputes in a democratic way. 
Germany has supported the inner-Tajik peace and democratisation process from the start and remains actively committed to encouraging dialogue amongst the various groups in the country as well as promoting the rule of law and respect for human rights. 
For years, Germany and Tajikistan have been cooperating in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime. 
Tajikistan is a particularly important partner in view of its 1300 km-long border with Afghanistan. 
Tajikistan’s President Rahmon visited Germany in December 2011 and met Federal Chancellor Merkel. 
The visit to Dushanbe on 1 April 2016 by Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was also there in his capacity as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, gave fresh momentum to bilateral relations. 
In 2016, German exports to Tajikistan were worth only 39.1 million euros, with electrical and mechanical engineering goods and vehicle parts accounting for a large portion of the total. 
In the same period, Tajik exports to Germany amounted to 1.3 million euros and comprised mainly agricultural products like raw cotton and foodstuffs. 
These developments in 2016 should be seen in the context of an overall decline in Tajikistan’s imports and exports compared with the previous year. 
As part of bilateral development cooperation, Germany is helping to build up sustainable economic structures in Tajikistan. 
successful foreign policy is only possible with strong women. 
“My thanks go to all women who with efficiency, commitment and great passion help shape German foreign policy: whether local employees, secretaries, couriers, records officers, visa office managers, assistant desk officers, desk officers, heads of division, directors, directors-general, heads of our missions abroad or partners,” State Secretary Lindner said. 
As an employer, the Federal Foreign Office pursues an active gender equality policy. 
Tajikistan has been a partner country for German development cooperation since 2003. 
Kreml... 
As part of technical cooperation, around 40 German experts seconded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the International Centre for Migration and Development (CIM) are currently working in Tajikistan. 
“Poland is not only a close neighbour for me, but also one of the most important partners in Europe,” Foreign Minister Gabriel told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. 
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), Welthungerhilfe (formerly German Agro Action) and Caritas also have offices there. 
In Warsaw: first official visit to a key partner 
The talks also focused on the shape and future of the EU and the security-policy situation in Europe. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel has recently spoken out in favour of strengthening Europe and for further steps to be taken towards a stronger common EU defence and security policy. 
Close relations between Germany and Poland – of interest also for the future of the EU 
Gabriel also stressed the importance of close cooperation between Germany and Poland with regard to cohesion within the EU: 
He is also scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov, whom he previously spoke with during the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn (16‑17 February). 
The two Foreign Ministers plan to give a joint press conference. 
At the intergovernmental negotiations in Berlin in December 2016, Germany pledged Tajikistan around 33.5 million euros for the period 2016-2017. 
In addition, the Federal Government has pledged up to 10.8 million euros from the special Energy and Climate Fund (ECF) as part of a special initiative implementing additional measures on climate change adaptation and forest and biodiversity conservation. 
There is particular appreciation for the activities of Welthungerhilfe, which was already engaged in humanitarian relief projects in the country during the civil war. 
The Federal Government currently supports projects in the following sectors: sustainable economic development, health, renewable energy, basic education, the environment, legal reform and disaster risk reduction. 
The organisation is still conducting food security, rural development and disaster risk reduction projects in rural areas. 
German cultural activities in Tajikistan focus on promoting the German language and on cooperation in the area of schools and higher education. 
A language learning centre supported by the Goethe-Institut has been operating in Dushanbe since February 2010. 
Two teachers seconded from Germany work at grammar schools in Dushanbe and Khujand, and a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) lector is working at Tajik State Pedagogical University in Dushanbe. In addition, a lecturer funded by the Robert Bosch Stiftung is working at the Russian-Tajik Slavonic University. 
Every year, some 60 to 70 scholarships are awarded by the DAAD, the Goethe-Institut and the Educational Exchange Service. 
A seconded specialist advises selected schools which offer more intensive German lessons. 
Most of the original population of around 39,000 ethnic Germans in Tajikistan have emigrated. The number of those currently living in the country is estimated at less than 500. 
For many years now, the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) has been engaged in excavation work in Tajikistan in cooperation with the Archaeological Museum in Dushanbe. 
The cities of Dushanbe and Reutlingen have been twinned since 1990. 
The city of Reutlingen has repeatedly donated medicines and vaccines to help fight epidemics and also supports hospitals and a school in Dushanbe. 
"I have just held talks with my Turkish counterpart. 
In the last few days, there has been talk time and again of growing tensions between Turkey and Germany, and also, unfortunately, within the Turkish community in Germany, and so it is good that we met today to talk in person. 
No matter how you view Turkey's position or how the Turkish side interprets our position, no matter how great the differences and disputes may be, I believe there is no alternative to talks. 
Only through talks will we step by step be able to return to normalised and, in fact, to what are very much friendly relations between Germans and Turks. 
I wish to say this at the beginning of my remarks. 
I personally have been very interested in Turkey for many years and decades now, also in the people from Turkey who live here. 
I always felt that a remarkably great and mature friendship has emerged between these two nations, between the people. 
Turkish people in Germany in particular have become important bridge-builders in Turkey. 
we must call to mind the great successes of this friendship and cooperation in the efforts to rebuild our country. We must call to mind the cultural, artistic and economic successes that Turkish people have achieved in Germany and also what Germans have achieved in Turkey. 
Recalling these good relations is important because they are currently so strained. 
Returning to this better normality is a desire that both my Turkish colleague and myself share. 
Of course, the Turkish side also pointed out that it too wished to be treated with respect. 
But I believe that both sides bear responsibility here. 
There are simply red lines that must not be crossed and this includes comparisons with Nazi Germany. 
Above all else, we want to be granted consular access now. 
I am sure that the Turkish side sees this in exactly the same way and understands that we are committed to the principles of the rule of law and respect. 
they are part of our country and this is how we want to see ourselves. 
That we do not treat anyone in a disrespectful manner and that they can always count on the friendship of the Germans. 
They should know that we are glad to have them here and that they should stay and help to develop this country with us. 
We will do our utmost to prevent conflicts that occasionally exist between countries or in other countries from driving Germans and Turkish people in Germany apart. 
After his talks with the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (8 March): 
Normality is better than the current state of affairs. 
Moreover, this also demonstrates that this is not normality. 
This is the freest country ever to have existed on German soil. We are one of the freest and most democratic countries in the world and I believe that accusations of the sort that we heard in recent days must not be allowed to be repeated. 
Secondly, I strongly advocated taking care not to weigh up mistakes or different topics against each other, but to look at matters on a case-by-case basis – this applies especially to the imprisonment of the German-Turkish (Turkish-German) journalist Deniz Yücel. 
Friendship between the two countries must be our objective and I would like to come back to what I said at the beginning of my remarks, 
People from both our countries are acquainted with each other. Today the ITB Berlin opens here. Turkey has been a major tourist destination for many years.

Christine Weil and Sabine Stöhr serve as Deputy Permanent Representatives while Colonel Carsten Rogat, General Staff, is the Military Adviser. 
Teaser 1: 
The OSCE has launched a considerable range of activities in recent years as part of its response to what are known as transnational threats and challenges. 
Policy areas that enjoy a particularly high level of visibility include counter-terrorism, police-related activities and matters concerning border management and security. These three topics have been addressed in dedicated units of the OSCE Secretariat for some time and have been part of the Transnational Threats Department’s (TNTD) remit since 2012. 
With its multidimensional security concept and field missions in 15 OSCE participating States and considering the fact that Central Asian OSCE participating States share borders with Afghanistan, the OSCE plays an important role in efforts to get to grips with transnational threats and challenges. 
In the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (the CFE Treaty), the currently 29 active States Parties have pledged to keep specific categories of major military equipment within national ceilings and to accept mutual inspections. 
The economy and the environment 
The second dimension of the OSCE focuses on policy issues in the fields of the economy and the environment. 
The most important conferences in the annual cycle are the Economic and Environmental Forum and its two preparatory meetings, as well as the Implementation Meeting regarding the obligations in the second dimension. 
In addition, the participating States engage in dialogue on current issues and challenges in the area of the economy and the environment at regular meetings of the Second Committee. 
The third dimension of the OSCE, the human dimension, is a core component of the OSCE’s comprehensive security concept and focuses on respect for and the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 
This dimension takes in the full spectrum of political and civil, as well as economic, social and cultural human rights, from the freedom of opinion and the freedom of assembly to the freedom of belief and religion, and from protection against torture to gender equality issues, which are discussed in the OSCE, against the backdrop of tolerance and non-discrimination. 
The participating States discuss the extent to which human rights obligations are being complied with in different countries as well as common challenges currently faced and possible common solutions and obligations that are required at regular committee meetings, in-depth conferences and the annual two-week-long Human Dimension Implementation Meeting. 
Links with other dimensions of the OSCE emerge particularly with respect to overarching issues. 
A noteworthy characteristic in comparison to other OSCE areas is the intensive exchange with representatives from civil society that is promoted at the conferences. 
Germany regularly supports their work above and beyond its general contributions to the OSCE. 
The regional team has a particular focus on conflicts in the OSCE area in which the organisation plays an important role as a mediator and/or observer. 
At the same time, the team is supporting the work of the 17 OSCE field missions in the Western Balkans, the Southern Caucasus, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
This team at the Permanent Mission deals with all aspects of OSCE management and administration, including personnel matters, as well as – crucially – budgetary issues (the entire OSCE budget and the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine). 
Preparing and hosting events by our mission in Vienna, protocol for high-ranking visitors from the Federal Government and other German governmental authorities, e.g. for attending OSCE conferences in Vienna, as well as looking after visitor groups, are further fields of work. 
There is little trade between the two countries. 
Germany has maintained diplomatic relations with Laos since 1958. Following the founding of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in 1975, both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic opened embassies in Vientiane. 
In the years after the revolution, Laos was a priority country of the former GDR’s development cooperation, 
which the Federal Republic of Germany has successfully continued since 1990. 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith at the ASEM Summit in Ulan Bator on 14 July 2016. 
Development cooperation 
Besides bilateral development cooperation, the Federal Government provides funding to support measures being conducted by the European Union and various United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 
Tourism is also important as a source of foreign currency, with 32,000 German tourists visiting the country in 2015.

Gabriel concluded his trip yesterday (9 March) with meetings with Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov and President Putin in Moscow. 
The talks with Putin and Lavrov covered a wide range of topics in addition to bilateral relations. These included the situation in Libya, eastern Ukraine and Syria, as well as the security-policy situation in Europe and relations between Europe and Russia. 
Gabriel called for disarmament in Europe: 
“We are concerned that we are moving towards a new arms race.” 
Cultural relations 
Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Niebel and Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle paid official visits to Laos in February 2012 and November 2012 respectively, the latter to attend the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit. 
A delegation of the German Bundestag’s Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the ASEAN States visited Laos in July 2015. 
Laos is a priority country of German development cooperation. German engagement there focuses on two areas: 
rural development in the country’s poor mountainous regions (with special attention being paid to forest preservation and 
support for the integration of the Lao economy into the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), in particular by providing macroeconomic advice and improving human resources (vocational training) as well as by promoting small and medium-sized enterprises. 
Since 2010, the priority areas have been extended to include climate and environmental protection elements. 
At the intergovernmental negotiations on development cooperation held on 9 and 10 November 2016, 45.8 million euros was pledged for projects conducted in these priority areas under the two-year programme 2016-17. 
Germany has spent a total of more than 7 million euros on the clearance of bombs, mines and other unexploded ordinance of which many are left over from the heavy fighting and bombing during the Indochina wars. 
In addition, Germany supports the Mekong River Commission (MRC), a regional organisation of which Laos, Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia are members and whose headquarters is in Vientiane, as well as promoting the country’s development through German and international non-governmental organisations and microprojects implemented by the German Embassy there. 
Owing to the country’s small population and relatively low purchasing power, Germany’s economic relations with Laos have not yet developed to any great degree. 
In 2015, bilateral trade was worth 115 million euros. (German imports from Laos totalling 74 million euros and German exports to Laos 41 million euros), 
A bilateral investment protection and promotion accord has been in place since 1996 (published in the Federal Law Gazette 1998 II, p. 1466). 
German and German-Lao companies are active in Laos in the renewable energy, service, textile production, building and mining sectors. 
Mercedes Benz and BMW have local dealerships there. 
There are a total of some 500 German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) alumni in Laos. 
Seven cooperation arrangements between German universities and statutory bodies and Lao partners also contribute to cultural exchange. 
Worthy of mention here is the highly successful master’s programme in environmental engineering and management introduced at NUoL in 2006 in cooperation with the University of Siegen. 
In January 2015, a new DAAD-funded project was launched with the University of Siegen and the TU Dresden as partners. The aim is to set up a master’s programme in water management at the NUoL. 
For a number of years now, the Goethe-Institut in Bangkok has supported the Vientianale International Film Festival, and in November 2015 it organised a dance workshop in Vientiane as part of its programme work. 
Further cooperation programmes are planned. 
Since 2011, funding from Germany’s Cultural Preservation Programme has been used to finance a project to conserve and restore the extremely vulnerable murals at the Wat Sisaket Temple in Vientiane. 
Detailed documentations of existing structures, examinations of damage and its causes, trial measures and the drawing up of sample grids culminated in late 2013 in a comprehensive conservation and restoration concept, which has been implemented since summer 2014. 
Germany has also supported a variety of projects, from the restoration of Buddhist temples and palm leaf manuscripts to the recording of classical Lao music. 
A former residential palace of the country’s former royal family in Luang Prabang, once the royal city in northern Laos, was partially renovated in 2015. This was the venue for an event held to mark the 20th anniversary of the granting of UNESCO World Heritage status in December 2015. 
This was the venue for an event held to mark the 20th anniversary of the granting of UNESCO World Heritage status in December 2015. The event was co-organised by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg and attended by its Director General Hartmut Dorgerloh. 
With regard to eastern Ukraine, Gabriel reported that both sides agreed on the aim of strengthening the OSCE Monitoring Mission. 
Interview with the Russian news agency Interfax 
The OSCE observers ought to be put in a position to monitor the conflict zones around the clock. 
Meetings with President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov in Moscow 
He also met with Foreign Minister Lavrov, whom he had previously spoken to at the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn (16‑17 February). 
In 2016, Germany and Guyana celebrated 50 years of friendly relations. 
The Federal Republic of Germany has contributed to Guyana’s economic recovery through debt cancellation. 
In development cooperation, Germany funds resource management and tropical forest preservation projects in Guyana. 
Through agreements between Germany and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Guyana is also indirectly involved in cooperation on sustainable economic development, the promotion of renewable energy and climate change adaptation. 
Other cooperation and trade accords exist within the framework of the agreements between the European Union and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) states as well as between the EU and CARIFORUM (CARICOM member states plus the Dominican Republic). 
Cologne Cathedral, for example, had a major impact on the development of architecture. 
What we have been saying for a number of days goes for the appearance of Turkish politicians in Germany. 
Some of the manuscripts are therefore in an extremely poor state. 
Another example is Syria. 
However, the ruins alone are incredibly impressive. 
The Great Colonnade for example, as well as the thermal baths and, of course, the Temple of Bel. 
In this photo, you can see IS, so-called Islamic State, blowing something up in Palmyra. 
And this not only happened here, but also elsewhere. 
They thus destroyed one of the world’s most important cultural objects. 
Or, to take another example, 
Artists from all sorts of places gather here each day and give performances, some of which have survived for centuries. 
The only question is how long this will be preserved for in real life. 
And these are only three examples of the important cultural sites around the world. 
This would only be enough to build a mere three kilometres of motorway. 
restoring and conserving historical buildings and setting up a digital cultural archive, such as in Syria. 
Federal Foreign Office condemns attack in Damascus 
We condemn the attack on a Shia shrine in Damascus in the strongest possible terms. 
This tragic event is further proof that Syria urgently needs a political solution, so that sectarian violence is deprived of a breeding ground. 
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families and friends of the victims. 
We also extend our condolences to the Government of Iraq and to the many Iraqis who have lost relatives in this attack. 
This heinous attack has apparently injured several dozen people and killed numerous more who were at the Damascus shrine to practice their religion in peace. 
At this virtual museum, you can watch what happens on the Djemaa El-Fna square via the Internet. 
And the fourth focus is 
The Federal Foreign Office has contributed 70 million euros since 1981. 
Such attacks show how cowardly and inhumane acts of terrorism can be. 
We will continue our consultations next week in Berlin. 
Do you think that this is an important contribution to achieving international understanding, or do you see this a bit differently? 
Feel free to have your say in the comments section below. 
Children are dying right before the eyes of the global public. 
You can tell us how important you think cultural preservation is. 
If comprehensive international relief measures are not taken quickly, millions of people in the affected regions are at risk of starvation. 
These are all places that have had a seminal impact on our lives. 
And collieries such as those in Essen shaped the lives of millions of people who lived and continue to live in the Ruhr region today. 
In short, Germany would not be the country that it is today without these places. 
However, it goes without saying that such impressive and influential places are not only to be found here in Germany. We have been and continue to be influenced by other cultures as well. 
Did you know that our culture’s origins also lie in this country? 
Syria plays a major role in all three major world religions, and long before Christianity, Judaism and Islam existed, it was the “cradle of civilisation”. 
Maybe some of you have already heard of Palmyra, an oasis city that was a trading centre in ancient times in particular. 
Traders from all parts of the world came here to sell their goods. A wild mixture of different languages was spoken on the city’s streets, and the palm gardens around both springs were extremely famous and popular. 
Today, only ruins remain of the city, which was destroyed by the Romans in around the third century AD. 
And this brings us to the problem, namely their destruction. 
The Djemaa El Fna square in Marrakech is famous around the world. 
Acrobats, magicians and storytellers, for example, gather a ring of spectators around them and just start performing. 
A ring like this is known as a halqa. 
This is a great thing, but it costs a lot of money, of course – money that must first be raised. 
We could go on with the temple city of Angkor in Cambodia, a golden letter from Myanmar and the Beth-El synagogue in Sao Paulo in Brazil. 
All of these are things that have shaped a country, a culture and, in some cases, even civilisation as a whole. 
It goes without saying that this costs money, of course. 
All of this can only be considered a first step. 
In total, the Federal Foreign Office has supported 2750 projects in 144 countries around the world – so quite a few. 
preserving German cultural heritage abroad, such as the conservation of German author Stefan Zweig’s house in Petrópolis, Brazil, which has been converted into a cultural meeting place using funds from the Federal Foreign Office’s Cultural Preservation Programme. 
Let’s talk about this topic, and thank you for watching! 
There’s the Wartburg in Thuringia where Martin Luther is thought to have translated the New Testament of the Bible from a tiny room. 
Many people wouldn’t have been able to read the Bible were it not for Martin Luther. 
A total of 400,000 manuscripts were salvaged in car boots, donkey carts and boats. They were stored in metal boxes and brought to safety. 
And this is precisely why it is important to preserve these cultural sites. 
The main focuses here are: 
Where do they see opportunities and risks in connection with the EU? 
training and assisting personnel in the region – the Malian librarian who saved these many manuscripts received financial support from the Federal Foreign Office, for example. 
We are ready to take a leading role in preventing this. 
“Europe is worth caring for” – foreign policy workshop with the public, focusing on the future of Europe 
We now need quick concerted action by the international donor community. 
A dialogue with Foreign Minister Gabriel 
Foreign Minister Gabriel talking to a participant 
“Nowhere in the world can people live as freely and with as much democracy as in Europe,” Foreign Minister Gabriel emphasised. 
Video – Foreign Minister Gabriel in Warsaw and Moscow 
Of course Germany will have to further step up its support as well. 
Poland is a close neighbour and an important partner for Germany. 
At the joint press conference, Gabriel called for support for the EU. 
“We should never forget that it is a great gift to be able to live in today’s Europe. 
And it is our joint task to keep this Europe together.” 
Enthusiasm for Europe 
“What kind of Europe do we want?” 
Gabriel also held in-depth talks with representatives of civil society at the German Ambassador’s residence. 
– a dialogue with members of the public 
When he was young, Foreign Minister Gabriel said, people were enthusiastic about the idea of a united Europe. 
Today, Gabriel went on to say, he has the impression that this fundamental aspect of the European project has been forgotten. 
Many things that were revolutionary at the time are today taken for granted. 
National narratives about Europe diverge greatly, and prejudices are becoming ingrained. 
Germany, for example, often sees itself as a net contributor that invests more in EU institutions than it benefits from them, while countries in southern Europe complain about austerity measures. 
Gabriel: We must speak with one European voice 
Gabriel: We must speak together, with one European voice 
“nowhere in the world can people live as freely and with as much democracy as in Europe.” 
Another aspect, he explained, is that the world is changing. 
While the populations of Asia, Africa and Latin America are growing, Europe’s population is shrinking. 
Europe must adopt its own position on influential countries such as Russia, China and the United States. 
With regard to the security situation in Europe, Gabriel underlined the joint responsibility for peace and stability. 
Both spoke frankly during their joint press conference: 
“I am concerned that we are facing the threat of a new arms race once again.” 
Even large countries like Germany will in future only play a part through their role in a strong European Union. 
It is this Union that we must work to improve, Gabriel said. 
Europe has brought peace, at least to Western Europe. 
In the coming years, the key question will be whether Europe can also make good on its promise to promote prosperity, particularly in southern Europe. 
What should tomorrow’s Europe look like? 
And I for one will do everything I can to ensure that the idea of the West of universal human rights, freedom and democracy does not become posthumous.” 
The workshop is part of a series of events titled “What kind of Europe do we want?” 
On arrival in Warsaw, the first stop on his visits to Poland and Russia, Foreign Minister Gabriel was given a football shirt for his daughter Thea, who was born at the weekend. 
“I see the West as a political, rather than a geographical, demarcation. 
During his talks with his Polish counterpart Waszczykowski, difficult topics were also addressed. 
Nowhere else in the world can people live in as much freedom, democracy and security as they can in Europe. 
His two-hour meeting with President Putin focused on bilateral relations, the security situation in Europe, and eastern Ukraine. 
Afterwards, he met his Russian counterpart Lavrov. 
Gabriel disputed Lavrov’s diagnosis that the world had entered a post-Western age. 
IS had occupied Palmyra for a long time and blown up the Temple of Bel, for example, because it stood for foreign knights and because they were out to steal the infidels’ identity. 
It is a bit like a fairytale from The Arabian Nights, only that all of this exists in reality. 
Even now, ever few artists are coming and some of their skills are simply not being passed on as they are no longer handed down to the next generation – and this is the reason why there is a virtual museum. 
This sounds like a lot, but isn’t really when compared with something like motorway construction. 
collecting, archiving and digitising various oral and physical sources, such as for the virtual museum in Morocco. 
See the infobox below for more information about this and further projects in the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s policy aims to get involved and to preserve and sometimes even save cultural objects, thereby helping people in a tangible way. 
So what’s your opinion about this? 
The next stop was Moscow, where Gabriel visited the Kremlin. 
The two key promises that the EU makes are peace and prosperity. 
In a phone call with the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Foreign Minister Gabriel pushes for concerted action to combat hunger and pledges to provide 15 million euros in emergency aid 
Following a phone call with UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O'Brien, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (12 March): 
Today I discussed the measures required to combat the dramatic famines in the Horn of Africa, the Lake Chad region and in South Sudan with UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O'Brien. 
According to reports from the hunger areas, the situation there is desperate. 
I assured UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O'Brien that Germany will double its support for the suffering people in the Horn of Africa by providing an additional 15 million euros in emergency funding. 
We are confident that other donors, too, will extend their assistance, which is so badly needed in the regions affected by the famine. 
Without the massive and sustained commitment of the international community it will not be possible to bring help to those who need it in time. 
With this in mind I will hold talks with representatives of major international relief organisations and donor countries next week. 
I therefore assured the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator that we are ready to take additional measures in order to do our part in ending the hunger crisis. 
The country conducted another missile test on 12 February 2017. 
“German Government condemns North Korean missile test” (press release of 12 February 2017) 
The UN Security Council adopts Resolution 2321 (30 November 2016) 
Exports of coal and iron are only permitted for the “livelihood purposes” of the population of North Korea. 
The press statement released afterwards condemned the North Korean Government’s conduct as “a grave violation” of Security Council resolutions. 
The most important forum for these efforts were the six-party talks that started in 2003 between North and South Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. 
North Korea’s nuclear programme and repeated missile and nuclear tests pose a serious threat to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and call the global nuclear non-proliferation regime into question. 
The international community remains concerned about North Korea’s missile programme and nuclear activities. 
On Friday (10 March), Foreign Minister Gabriel met with 130 workshop participants for a discussion on European policy and the future of the European Union. 
What worries Germans about Europe? 
On Friday (10 March), 130 participants in a foreign policy workshop with the public had the chance to address these questions about the future of Europe directly to Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. 
European cooperation was the 20th century’s greatest project for civilisation, and it has helped to overcome animosities and conflicts in Europe. 
This is why the Foreign Minister chose to engage directly with citizens. The foreign policy workshop with the public brought together 130 participants between the ages of 17 and 77 for a discussion about the future of Europe. 
Participants first had the opportunity to pose questions to Sigmar Gabriel. 
Afterwards, they split into small groups to talk about European values, Europe’s role in the world and Germany’s role in the EU, as well as European and national identities. 
Ahead of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, Federal Foreign Office representatives have since October 2016 been attending public events throughout Germany, from Flensburg to Rosenheim, at which they meet with interested members of the general public to discuss Germany’s policy on Europe and the future of the European Union. 
In contrast to the experiences and resentment that characterised the post-war years, people were suddenly presented with an alternative, an entirely new prospect: living together in Europe in peace. 
They spent their summer holidays abroad and got to know people in other countries. 
This crisis must be overcome, Gabriel insisted, saying that 
The Minister stressed that “our children and grand-children will only be heard in the world if Europe speaks with one voice.” 
North Korea’s leadership tested a Pukguksong-2 medium-range ballistic missile on 12 February 2017. 
On behalf of the German Government, Foreign Minister Gabriel condemned North Korea’s latest missile test in the strongest possible terms: 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the death of Horst Ehmke 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (13 March) on the death of Horst Ehmke: 
I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of Horst Ehmke. 
What was highly controversial at the time is now almost seen as a cliché – 
détente was the right policy as regards overcoming the division of Europe. 
He deserves heartfelt gratitude and great recognition for this. 
More information on the election of the Federal President 
I will remember Horst Ehmke as a great social democrat, a gifted speaker and a brave and open-minded thinker. 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will take his oath of office before the assembled Members of the German Bundestag and the Bundesrat on 22 March. 
In addition, Germany provides assistance in the region through micro-projects. 
Guyana hopes to be able to exploit its recently discovered oil and gas fields soon, but has committed itself to a new direction on energy at home (with the aim of meeting its own energy needs in full as soon as possible through water, solar and biomass power). 
The Federal Convention is convened by the President of the German Bundestag and meets not later than thirty days before the term of office of the current Federal President expires. 
A long and full life came to an end last night. 
The Federal Convention consists of the Members of the Bundestag and an equal number of members elected by the parliaments of the Länder. 
Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, to whom I would like to convey my sincere sympathy. 
I will remain a fan of his political detective novels, which include many of his experiences in politics. 
Electing the Federal President is the sole task of the Federal Convention. 
He leaves behind an important foreign policy legacy. 
German Ostpolitik would have been inconceivable without his constant work alongside Willy Brandt and Egon Bahr. 
Our views on conducting talks and dialogue across all political, ideological and heavily fortified borders paved the way to a free and united Europe. 
Horst Ehmke played a crucial role in setting and achieving this course. 
We will remember him for this work. 
At an important moment in history for Germany and Europe, he recognised the sign of the times and was a firm advocate of social and political opening on the part of German social democracy. 
The Federal President must be a German national, be entitled to vote in Bundestag elections and have attained the age of forty. 
Re-election for a consecutive term is permitted only once (Article 54 of the Basic Law). 
Nor may the Federal President hold any other salaried office, or engage in any trade or profession, 
Federal Convention elects the Federal President 
Over the entire course of his life, Horst Ehmke rendered invaluable services to our country and to German social democracy as a deeply committed member of the German Bundestag, a Federal Minister and a long-standing member of the SPD Executive Committee. 
Horst Ehmke stands for an SPD in tune with the times, a party that resolutely takes on the challenges of the present on the basis of firmly held values and courageously sets the course for the future. 
Congo 
Politics 
Brazzaville is twinned with Dresden. 
Several members of the German Bundestag visited the Republic of the Congo in November 2015 and February 2016. 
Economic relations between Germany and the Republic of the Congo are not very intensive. 
There are only a few German investors active in the Republic of the Congo, although interest has recently been growing. 
A German-African Business Association delegation visited the country in September 2014. 
Germany provides follow-up support for former scholarship holders from the country and advises students who want to study in Germany. 
Overview 
On the following pages, you will find an overview of our most important tasks. 
Between 12 and 15 people usually work at the Permanent Mission. 
The German Embassy was closed in 1997 as a result of the civil war. 
The Republic of the Congo is not a partner of German bilateral development cooperation. 
Among the German businesses operating there is the German insurance group Allianz, as well as companies active in the infrastructure sector and the timber industry. 
Germany imports crude oil and timber from the Republic of the Congo and exports machinery, motor vehicles, iron goods and household goods and chemical products to the country. 
Cultural cooperation between Germany and the Republic of the Congo is limited in scope. 
German is an optional subject at three grammar schools in Brazzaville, but is not taught at University level. 
The only UNESCO natural World Heritage site in the Republic of the Congo, the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the far north of the country, receives financial support from KfW as part of the Sangha Trinational conservation project. 
It was reopened in 2013 as a micro-mission, with an Ambassador but no support staff, on the premises of the French Embassy. 
The Federal Foreign Office on the situation in Myanmar 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson commented today (13 March) on the situation in Myanmar: 
The refugee movements sparked by these conflicts are also disquieting. 
The term of office of Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will begin on 19 March, when the tenure of his predecessor, former Federal President Joachim Gauck, ends. 
The Federal President is elected by the Federal Convention without debate. 
Independent observers must also be permitted to report objectively on the situation. 
The Government of Myanmar faces great challenges, 
Over the past years Myanmar has undergone a remarkable and encouraging process of reform. 
The European Union and the German Government will continue to offer their support to the Government of Myanmar as it pursues these goals. 
The reports on the situation in Rakhine and on the fighting in north-eastern Myanmar give us cause for concern. 
It is now a matter of urgency that humanitarian agencies be granted access to get aid to the people in the region – both in Rakhine and in the areas affected by hostilities in Kachin and Shan. 
We are working to obtain full clarification and hope that the efforts of the Myanmar Government, drawing on the Rakhine development plan and the recommendations of the Advisory Commission chaired by Kofi Annan, will bring about a lasting improvement to the situation. 
The Government in Yangon has a historic chance to lead the country further towards democracy, peace and prosperity, taking all the people of Myanmar with it on this journey. 
as shown by the latest UN reports on the incidents in Rakhine. 
During Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2016, the number of staff increased to over 30 at times. 
The staff also include colleagues from the joint administration who provide administrative services to all three German missions in Vienna. 
Permanent Mission staff mainly comprise Federal Foreign Office employees and staff from the Federal Ministry of Defence who are seconded to the Federal Foreign Office for the duration of their posting to the OSCE Permanent Mission. 
How is the Permanent Mission structured and what does it do? 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on six years of civil war in Syria 
These protests developed into the most horrendous conflict of our time. 
More than 600,000 people are to this day denied access to humanitarian assistance, people are being starved and driven out - just as we have seen over the last few days in Al Waer near Homs. 
European integration and the European Union 
That is why I pledged one million euros of support for the IIIM to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
The transatlantic partnership 
Germany promotes binding rules and effective multilateral institutions that facilitate orderly and close cooperation in an increasingly interconnected world. 
Half of the Syrian population has fled, more than 400,000 people have lost their lives as a result of the conflict and the country has been reduced to ruins. 
The most recent attempt to achieve a ceasefire has only had a very limited impact. 
Even six years on, the conflicting parties, first and foremost the Syrian regime, still believe they will secure a military victory. 
We cannot sit idly by as human rights and international humanitarian law are repeatedly disregarded in Syria, as civilian infrastructure is attacked from the air and there are widespread allegations that people are being tortured by Islamist terror groups and in prisons run by the Syrian regime. 
We have to lay the groundwork now so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. 
The IIIM is to systematically prepare evidence for the gravest crimes committed in Syria for proceedings in national and international courts and thus make an essential contribution to investigating these crimes and bringing those responsible to justice. 
Germany’s foreign policy is value-oriented and interest-led.

Alongside European integration, the transatlantic partnership is the most important pillar of German foreign policy. 
Transatlantic relations are based on historical experiences and shared values such as democracy, freedom and the rule of law. 
Bild: Dt. BW-Soldaten … 
German foreign policy is committed to peace and security around the world. 
Endeavours in the fields of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation of weapons and armaments are an important component of German peace policy. 
Germany’s work in the fields of crisis prevention, stabilisation, post-conflict peacebuilding and humanitarian aid is also part of its peace and security policy. 
Germany is now one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid worldwide and a pioneer in civil crisis prevention, mediation and stabilisation.

We cannot sit idly by as human rights are disregarded and international humanitarian law is repeatedly violated in Syria, as civilian infrastructure is attacked from the air and there are widespread allegations that people are being tortured by Islamist terror groups and in prisons run by the Syrian regime. 
They must never feel they are beyond the reach of the law. 
That is why I pledged one million euros of support to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in Syria. 
Especially now after six years of war, we will do our utmost to ensure that can finally happen.” 
“Six years ago today, peaceful protests began in Syria to bring about civil liberties, a more just society and an end to tyranny. 
Put briefly, Germany regards multilateralism as the most important principle for international order, and will remain committed to this principle in the future.

The three pillars of foreign policy 
Bild: Dt. Sprache… 
Together with our partners in the UN General Assembly, we in December 2016 called into being the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in Syria. 
The central pillar of German foreign policy is flanked by two other pillars. 
Cultural relations and education policy forms the third pillar of German foreign policy. 
The Federal Government is working nationally and internationally to ensure criminal investigation and prosecution of the gravest crimes under international law.

The German Government’s foreign policy is based on a range of constants and fundamental principles, 
The numerous foreign policy challenges in a constantly changing world can only be addressed by a strong Europe and by working with our European partners. 
A stronger Europe is therefore the most important response to the challenges of globalisation.

The US is Germany’s closest ally outside Europe. 
These relations are rooted in common interests and objectives, as well as the two countries’ long-standing close social, political and economic ties. 
Following the the UK’s decision to leave the EU, Germany remains committed to a good relationship with the UK in a spirit of partnership. 
Commitment to peace and security 
German Bundeswehr soldiers at Camp Gastor in Gao, Mali 
On the sixth anniversary of the start of protests against the Assad regime in Syria and to highlight German support to the tune of one million euros for the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in Syria, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (14 March) in Berlin: 
Only if earnest negotiations are conducted and the difficult questions concerning the country’s political future are tackled by all parties with the necessary will to reach a compromise can we end the horror experienced by the Syrian people. 
In the first instance, peace policy means diplomatic efforts to reach political settlements to crises and conflicts such as those in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. 
Germany also takes on security responsibility, including military action when absolutely necessary, for example in combating so-called Islamic State (IS) and stabilising Afghanistan and Mali. 
Confidently promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights is thus an important component of German peace and security policy. 
Germany’s foreign policy priorities 
European integration and the European Union (EU) are the cornerstones of German foreign policy and set its course. 
German foreign policy aims to ensure that globalisation is fair and sustainable. 
Global justice is a key prerequisite for international peace and security. 
German foreign policy therefore also addresses topics such as displacement and migration, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, energy and resource security, climate protection, environmental and water issues, the spread of digital technology, internet freedom, cyber security and urbanisation. 
As Germany is more interconnected with the world than almost any other country, a resilient, rules-based international order is in its own fundamental foreign policy interests. 
Its instruments include academic exchange, international German schools and the promotion of German as a foreign language. 
By fostering intercultural dialogue, this policy creates a solid foundation for international relations and global trust in Germany – a particularly important function for a country that has such close international ties. 
On 12 February 2017, the 16th Federal Convention elected Frank-Walter Steinmeier to become the 12th President of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier received 931 of the 1253 votes cast during the first round and accepted his election. 
The President of the Bundestag is responsible for all preparatory, implementation and follow-up measures related to the Convention. 
More detailed information on the Convention is available here from the German Bundestag website. 
The details of the election are governed by the Presidential Election Act, which is based on Article 54 (7) of the Basic Law. 
With a 2014 ruling, the Federal Constitutional Court further specified the tasks and powers of the Federal Convention (Federal Constitutional Court ruling of 10 June 2014, 2 BvE 2/09, 2 BvE 2/10). 
The term of office is five years. 
The Federal President may not be a member of the government or of a legislative body of the Federation or of a Land (Article 55 (1) of the Basic Law). 
or belong to the management or supervisory board of any enterprise conducted for profit (Article 55 (2) of the Basic Law). 
On assuming office, the Federal President takes an oath before the assembled Members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat (Article 56 of the Basic Law). 
Humanitarian assistance for Iraq - how Germany is helping the people in Mosul 
The humanitarian situation is very serious for many people in Iraq, despite it usually being overshadowed by the crisis in Syria. 
The huge efforts of the international community have so far prevented a humanitarian disaster in Mosul. 
Germany is one of the largest donors of aid to the people in need in Iraq. 
In 2016 alone, the Federal Foreign Office invested more than 119 million euros in humanitarian aid projects. 
The main focuses of Germany’s engagement are the provision of drinking water and mine clearance. 
Shirkat refugee camp in northern Iraq 
Rebuild and Relief International 
In total, almost a third of the Iraqi population – eleven million people – require humanitarian aid, including more than three million internally displaced persons. 
Half of those in need in the country are children and young people, two million of whom have not been able to attend school for some years. 
Since October 2016, Iraqi security forces in Mosul have been fighting against the terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS). 
The goal is the complete liberation of the city and its residents from the terrorists. 
However, the ongoing fighting in the region around Mosul is making it difficult to reach those in need. 
Mr Schmitz-Schwarzkopf, 
Adelheid, 
Flanking the liberation of Mosul with humanitarian support 
Thank you very much for your invitation! 
And so I want to take a leaf from what Egon Bahr himself said in Tutzing: 
“I won’t give a rival speech”! 
A contribution to a better future – aid supplies for Shirkat refugee camp 
To date more than 220,000 people have fled from the fighting to neighbouring regions and cities. 
A large number of the refugees have been accommodated in holding camps, while nearly 400,000 people are receiving emergency humanitarian assistance in Mosul itself. 
However, one million people are currently cut off from assistance due to the security situation in the region. 
As early as July 2016, the United Nations issued an appeal for help in order to be able to prepare for the measures that would be needed in the course of the liberation of Mosul. 
International donor pledges met 97 percent of these requirements – and Germany made an important contribution to this success. 
Germany, one of the largest donors 
The restoration of the drinking water supply is improving the health situation and is helping to prevent hygiene-related diseases. 
German humanitarian aid 
Humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance 
Mines Advisory Group 
Since 2014, Germany, as one of the largest donors of aid for the displaced persons and refugees in Iraq, has provided more than 273 million euros for humanitarian projects, more than 119 million euros of this in 2016 alone. 
Egon Bahr certainly did not give a rival speech. 
As the emergency humanitarian situation in central and north-western Iraq still exists, the Federal Government will continue its engagement in 2017. 
The Federal Foreign Office is cooperating with numerous partners in this area. 
It replaced it with a policy founded on the understanding that 
it would be impossible to achieve détente in inner-German relations and, moreover, East-West relations through power politics, 
These include the humanitarian organisations of the United Nations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and German non-governmental organisations. 
The most urgent priorities are weatherproofing temporary accommodation for internally displaced persons, providing healthcare for those in need and supplying drinking water and waste water treatment. 
Priorities: drinking water and mine clearance 
– in the minds of Willy Brandt and Egon Bahr, who had worked on these ideas for months. 
On the outskirts of Bashira 1.5 tons of explosives were found and defused – some of the ammunition was hidden under a road. 
The revolutionary had become a matter of course. 
“rapprochement through change”. 
So this was not an appeal along the lines of 
“change yourself and then we can become closer to one another”, 
The German aid organisation Rebuild and Relief International (RRI) is an important partner in this context, working to build 30 new drinking water wells in Anbar province. 
The poor quality of the drinking water that has been available until now causes diseases and epidemics and is life-threatening, especially for babies and small children. 
The wells built by RRI will significantly improve the quality of the drinking water available and tackle the acute water shortage in the region. 
A second focus of German assistance for the region is the removal of explosive agents of warfare – humanitarian mine clearance. 
With financial support from the Federal Foreign Office, the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) is clearing anti-personnel mines in northern Iraq. 
MAG is also cooperating with teachers and other local multipliers to raise public awareness of the dangers posed by mines. 
that is, Europe, the transatlantic partnership, work to support the cause of peace and security around the world, the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and commitment to fair and sustainable globalisation and a rules-based international order. 
A stronger Europe is the most important response to the challenges of globalisation 
Also as regards shaping globalisation and a new international order, Germany will only remain capable of effective action in a European framework in light of the shifting global balance of power. 
The German Government is thus committed to closer European cooperation, especially on the EU’s common foreign and security policy, as well as to joint efforts to safeguard Europe’s external borders, foster internal security and strengthen economic policy. 
The US is one of Germany’s most important partners 
At all times, German foreign policy is committed to a close transatlantic relationship in a spirit of partnership and mutual trust, as well as to a an open dialogue and respectful cooperation with the US, especially when there are differences of viewpoint or opinion. 
German foreign policy promotes the strengthening of human rights worldwide 
but also because this is in its foreign policy interests. 
Peace, security, stability and sustainable development can only prevail in the long term where democratic and rule of law principles apply and human rights are respected. 
Global justice is a prerequisite for international peace and security 
German foreign policy thus works to enhance long-standing and essential institutions and structures such as the EU, NATO, the UN, the OSCE and the G7, as well as new elements of order, partnerships and international formats, for example the G20, the agreement between the E3+3 countries and Iran on the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme and the Normandy format aimed at resolving the Ukraine crisis. 
German is taught at language schools all over the world, such as here at the Goethe-Institut in Kyiv 
As the world's leading exporter, Germany has a particular interest in an effective external economic policy that helps companies to tap into international markets and to improve the conditions for doing business.

Strengthening the EU’s cohesion and close cooperation with all EU member states are thus long-term priorities for Germany. 
Germany primarily defines its peace and security policy in multilateral terms, that is, within the framework of international institutions and structures such as the EU, NATO, the United Nations, the OSCE, the G7 and the G20. 
Once it was made public, this break with tradition was the subject of heated criticism. 
Egon Bahr would probably have heard very little of this at first 
as he went on holiday right after giving his speech. 
While there, he received a message from Willy Brandt: 
“You’ve not been in touch at all, you rascal. 
The Federal Foreign Office is also engaged in addressing severe and escalating crises, such as in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Ukraine. 
Such things are wholly unimaginable these days. 
Firstly, Willy Brandt would have known him well enough. 
At any rate, the shock waves that this speech caused back then were incredible. 
I myself didn’t take much notice of the speech – I was just four years old at the time. 
After all, I grew up right on the inner-German border. 
And he also influenced coming generations of politicians with his understanding of politics. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Egon Bahr’s Tutzing speech 
Calling to mind the Tutzing speech in these weeks and months is something quite special. 
Egon Bahr recalled that the actual break with tradition took place long before the Tutzing speech 
I therefore wish to try at least to look at today’s world through the eyes of Egon Bahr. 
Simple historical parallels are off limits in all this, of course. 
The complexities of a divided Germany that Brandt and Bahr had to deal with are, fortunately, a thing of the past today – also thanks in large part to the policy of change, which was informed by rapprochement and not by confrontation. 
Secondly, he unflinchingly drew the political consequences from this. 
In some cases, or so it seems to me, these seem to be calibrated to wishful thinking and not to reflecting reality. 
As Germans and Europeans, we must acknowledge that tectonic shifts and a 
recalibration of the world as we know it are under way. 
This is what I mean by the wishful thinking that we must cast off. 
What do I mean when I speak of a recalibration of the world? 
These shifts are visible throughout the world. 
Asia, Latin America and Africa are growing while Europe is shrinking. 
Today, we must acknowledge that Asian countries are not only trading partners, but have long since become competitors – 
Another area is the role played by Russia. 
Germany provides aid to many countries, including to Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia and Myanmar. 
In 2016, the Federal Foreign Office provided funds totalling some 18 million euros for humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance, including victim assistance, in 13 countries. 
An additional 15 million euros were spent on mine and IED clearance in Iraq, as part of stabilisation measures. 
With total expenditure of 33 million euros, Germany is one of the largest donors in this domain. 
We mustn’t simply sweep this under the carpet. 
It was entirely clear what their own political position was. 
This is no different today. 
This applies to the conflict in Ukraine, of course, and also to the conflicts in Syria, Libya and in other parts of the world. 
Allow me to quote Egon Bahr here as well: 
“Russia is immovable.” 
Russia, Turkey and North Africa are all our neighbours. 
And in all of this, we must take care not to make wishful thinking the primacy of politics. 
We are deeply concerned about the welfare of two seconded United Nations experts and their Congolese colleagues who went missing on Sunday (12 March) in the Kasai region. 
The terrible conflict in Syria has been raging for six years. 
One million euros for the investigation and prosecution of crimes in the conflict in Syria 
Again and again, we hear reports of the gravest violations of international law by Islamist terrorist groups and by the Assad regime. 
Working with the OSCE 
“The perpetrators must never feel they are beyond the reach of the law,” declared Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as he pledged one million euros to support United Nations measures to investigate and prosecute these crimes. 
Human Rights Council... 
The United Nations Human Rights Council 
Germany is assuming an active and proactive role in international organisations. 
We are promoting the deployment of German staff in international organisations. 
Most horrendous conflict of our time 
What started out on 15 March 2011 with peaceful protests against a repressive government has developed into the most horrendous conflict of our time, claiming over 400,000 lives to date. 
Half of the Syrian population has fled, and hundreds of thousands, under siege and cut off from humanitarian assistance, are being starved. 
Civilian infrastructure is being subjected to repeated aerial attacks. 
There are widespread accusations of torture. 
Bring the perpetrators to justice 
also within the OSCE, of course. 
The groundwork had to be laid now, he continued, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. 
Gabriel and Guterres 
Egon Bahr also helps us to comprehend the shifts that we are currently observing in the US. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and UN Secretary-General Guterres (file photo) 
That sounds like an up-to-the-minute assessment. 
In light of this American approach, which is nothing new but which is now more clearly coming to the fore, invoking the past and reaffirming our common values is not enough. 
While this is important, we need a new European approach that can show us the way forward for our transatlantic relations. 
Germany will provide one million euros to support its work. 
Long-standing commitment to investigation 
As early as 2014, Germany co-sponsored a UN resolution which would have referred the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. 
Federal Foreign Office on the disappearance of United Nations experts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
This incident again highlights the great dangers to which United Nations personnel are exposed in conflict zones. 
We call on the Congolese Government to work with the UN MONUSCO Mission and do everything in its power to determine the whereabouts of the experts without delay and ensure their safety. 
Germany supports the efforts of the international community to promote peaceful development in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
The experts were travelling under the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1533 (2004). 
Under this resolution, a group of experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo is charged with monitoring implementation of the sanctions regime imposed by the UN Security Council. 
It failed because of the veto by Russia and China. 
There is already also an Independent International Commission on Inquiry on Syria in the UN Human Rights Council, of which Germany is currently a member. 
So this latest pledge is the continuation of a long-standing German commitment to investigating and prosecuting violations of international law. 
Return to negotiations 
After six years of war, Foreign Minister Gabriel called for earnest negotiations and for a willingness on all sides to compromise, in order to end the horror being experienced by the Syrian people: 
“Despite all the setbacks, we need to continue our work to ensure the negotiations in Geneva to bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict in Syria are continued.”

Foreign Minister Gabriel’s statement in full 
Germany’s humanitarian aid in Syria 
While the Federal Foreign Office and the Permanent Mission stand ready to help you with your application, 
it is the OSCE alone which will take the final decision. 
“We cannot sit idly by as human rights are disregarded and international humanitarian law is repeatedly violated in Syria,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said in Berlin on the anniversary of the start of the protests. 
To this end, Gabriel has pledged financial support to UN Secretary-General Guterres for the new International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in Syria. 
Furthermore, there is the possibility of a secondment to the OSCE or its field missions (“seconded positions”). 
It is not possible to submit a direct application to the OSCE for those positions. 
Instead, each OSCE participating state can nominate candidates; that state will then also be responsible for their payment. 
In Germany, the Center for International Peace Operations (Zentrum für Internationale Friedenseinsätze, ZIF), in coordination with the Federal Foreign Office, is responsible for nominating and seconding staff. 
The Center also offers preparatory courses. 
If you are interested in election monitoring, please also contact ZIF.

It is a great honour for me as Egon Bahr is someone with whom I not only shared historical ties, but also a mutual friendship. 
We just heard this impressive speech. 
He was, of course, referring to Willy Brandt, the then mayor in another Berlin city hall somewhat further west, who had spoken before him in Tutzing. 
It was much more than that, of course! 
He sketched out a bold and radical new start, 
This was Egon Bahr wearing both the master builder and architect’s hats. 
The new policy cast off the ideological ballast of the post-war era. 
but rather through pragmatic rapprochement – 
without abandoning the long-term aim of a reunified Germany and overcoming the division of Europe. 
“When I dictated the words ‘change through rapprochement’”, said Egon Bahr, “I didn’t have the impression that I was being brave”. 
much would change when we became closer to one another. 
This is perhaps the most important lesson at a time in which we are currently witnessing how those who call loudest for others to change get the most headlines and the biggest applause – 
yet without displaying the willingness to engage with others. 
“Aggression in carpet slippers” was the slant that East Berlin put on it, 
while the CDU decried it as “change through ingratiation”. 
Meanwhile, Herbert Wehner railed that the proposals were “total rubbish” (“ba(h)rer Unsinn – a play on Egon Bahr’s name) and a folly! 
We have to talk about the Tutzing issue. 
But I was its beneficiary later on. 
We had actually grown to accept the division of Germany. 
Keeping the bigger picture in mind and yet taking concrete steps in the here and now is a particular skill. 
Of course, other new challenges have taken their place today. 
He didn’t make wishful thinking, but rather reality the plank of his policy. 
In view of this state of affairs, the need for humanitarian assistance is great. 
Specially trained mine detection dogs have been deployed for this task. 
As a result, more than 1100 square kilometres have once again been made inhabitable for the local people. 
We took advantage of the minor cross-border traffic, but we didn’t believe that this frontier would disappear one day. 
Other honours 
Firstly, he was not afraid to look reality squarely in the eye. 
China has long been on track to become an exporter of technology. 
On the contrary, we must address this openly. 
And, at the same time, we must – without any illusions like Egon Bahr – seek scope for cooperation. 
It was entirely indisputable that they belonged to the Western Alliance and 
that they considered freedom, democracy and human rights to be universal values. 
It was also clear that those with whom they conducted negotiations had entirely different perceptions regarding how people should coexist. 
Incidentally, this applies to all neighbours that we have. 
in the Arctic, at the North Pole, the polar bears. 
We should also be mindful that only change through rapprochement is possible here – and that rapprochement through change is not a winning formula. 
And I see no other option than to try to seek scope for cooperation with these neighbours. 
As well as the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Silver Laurel Leaf, the Federal President awards the following honours: 
In the course of the project, which has been in place since March 2016, more than 2000 mines and explosive munitions remnants have been discovered and defused to date. 
And he certainly more than acquitted himself on that score! 
the Zelter Badge (for a choral society centenary), 
the PRO MUSICA Badge (for a music society centenary). 
and not about 
“change through rapprochement” 
And secondly, Egon Bahr would have wanted his speech to be publicised, of course. 
But the thoughts that he articulated in Tutzing had a profound impact on us all, of course. 
Egon Bahr combined a most pragmatic political approach with a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve for our country in the long term not only in his Tutzing speech, but also throughout his long political career. 
Moreover, we must acknowledge that these shifts do not necessarily entail Europe emerging from these global developments as a winner.

Egon Bahr’s insight regarding Moscow was always particularly sharp – he precisely gauged the former Soviet Union’s interests. 
That was the hallmark of Bahr and Brandt’s policy.

I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we need precisely this mentality in Europe today – 
and sounding out possible improvements. 
Above all, we need to change the narrative about Europe, particularly in our country. 
You see before you today a very happy, optimistic European. 
As Economic Affairs Minister, he visited Ukraine in 2014 to discuss economic aid for the country. 
Germany wishes to support Ukraine’s efforts to develop its economy, Gabriel emphasised, and stands what it has pledged. 
This is a false narrative about Germany’s role in Europe. 
And I think that we must make a start here in Germany before talking about instruments for changing these narratives. 
Simply telling the truth – 
that we are the great winners of European integration. 
Not only politically, through reunification, 
Text Video Statement BM 
I am an optimistic European at other times, too, but after yesterday’s election result we are all, I think, also extremely happy, because we have seen more than 80% of voters in the Netherlands turning out against the enemies of Europe and against the enemies of Islam. 
They kept a cool head – a clear, pro-European signal at a time when many expected something different. 
And, incidentally, only if the others are rich enough to afford our goods will there be jobs in our country. 
And quite well at that, I’ll admit. 
Even a strong Germany wouldn’t be heard in this world. 
The Europe that we are talking about now is the Europe of our children and grandchildren. 
They will curse us if we fail to continue to develop what was established under much more difficult circumstances following the Second World War. 
And it must have been pretty damn difficult after the Second World War. 
These countries must have shown a great amount of understanding as the Germans had pillaged, burned and murdered their way through their countries only shortly beforehand. 
That must have been incredibly difficult. 
So the difficulties were much greater then than they are now. 
It is for this reason that I believe that we Germans bear a particular responsibility because we know that this project will be of great importance especially for our children and grandchildren. 
There is no region in the world in which people can live with as much freedom, democracy and security as they can in Europe. 
This is, I believe, the changed narrative that we must relate especially in our country. 
And, by the way, I believe that we must not succumb too often to the temptations coming to us variously from Washington, Moscow and Beijing – 
Yes, Germany has a responsibility and is an anchor of stability for many other countries. 
And we want to take this responsibility. 
However, Germany is not the answer to everything at the end of the day. 
For example, when we no longer talk about disarmament, but about an arms race. 
And not only here, but also in Russia, of course. 
Building up a military power at the heart of Europe – that’s not how I interpret Bahr’s legacy at any rate. 
And, thirdly, always having the courage to develop visions about the peaceful coexistence of our peoples here on this continent 
Egon Bahr shows us many ways to approach the challenges of today. 
“The Wall”, he said, “is a sign of weakness”, “a sign of fear”. 
Egon Bahr comes to our aid here too. 
He was not only a brilliant analyst of international policy, 
but he also – and this never ceases to impress me – didn’t allow himself “to be paralysed by reality”. 
assessing the developments in the world without any fear 
If we Europeans intend to continue to play an influential role in a changing world, then we must change ourselves and develop a strong Europe ready to shoulder responsibility. 
And so almost every member state has developed its own narrative, which have, at their core, always remained national narratives. 
but in real terms in daily life in our economy. 
And the second story that we must tell, and there are many young people in the audience here today, is that this is actually about them, about the next generations. 
When they’re our age, they will only have a voice in this world if it is a common European voice. 
And these were precisely the countries to invite us back to the fold of civilised peoples. 
We know that this is the greatest project of the 20th century promoting Western civilised values and that this continues to be the case in the 21st century. 
However, Egon Bahr would tell us to stand up to this and not just to take it on the chin. 
And, by the way, I’m not so sure that those who currently expect Germany to double its military spending in eight years will still be happy about that in a few years from now. 
The Tutzing speech and many other speeches by Egon Bahr offer us guidance in quite different ways. 
Firstly, there is the mantra of change through rapprochement – 
reaching out to the other side and not always waiting for them to change. 
Secondly, the conviction that this rapprochement will lead to success – 
when this will come to pass is uncertain, but we are confident that it will happen. 
Rather, we should, fearlessly and boldly, stand up for our liberal, open and democratic societies. 
“Since otherwise”, as Egon Bahr proclaimed in his great Tutzing speech, “we would have to wait for a miracle, and that is no policy at all.” 
All of this, ladies and gentlemen, are the “recalibrations” that we Europeans must deal with. 
consistently drawing the political conclusions, even when they were “outrageously uncomfortable”, as he put it in his speech in Tutzing. 
This is simply not the case. 
You can’t become a European or world champion in the export market without being a country that sells more goods than it buys. 
Only when ours is a European voice will we have a say over decisions, and only then will we be part of the international community. 
I at any rate cannot imagine that the populations of these countries applauded their politicians all that much for doing that. 
but rather it is made up of many small countries that are equal partners, as well as many medium-sized and, admittedly, the relatively large country that is Germany. 
After all, the EU consists of all of the countries that it is made up of. 
If it were up to me, this would be 28 member states; we will now be 27, however.

Human Rights Commissioner on the situation in the Philippines 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (16 March) on the situation in the Philippines: 
100 years of the DGIR: 
Nearly 8000 people have already been killed since President Duterte began his “war on drugs”. 
The German Society of International Law (DGIR) celebrates its centenary this year. 
In his address, Foreign Minister Gabriel explained why international law is irreplaceable, for Germany and the world. 
The centenary of the German Society of International Law – Foreign Minister Gabriel in Berlin 
Since then, the DGIR has made an important contribution to the acceptance of binding and fair rules governing the coexistence of states around the world in all legal spheres. 
US jurist Thomas Buergenthal and Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel 
As long as Senator de Lima has not been convicted, she must be able to exercise her mandate. 
The Department of Justice, which she herself headed between 2010 and 2015, recently filed illegal drugs trafficking charges against her. As a result, she has been in custody since 24 February 2017. 
In particular, the Philippines must ensure her safety in detention. 
In this regard, I welcome the clear statement made by EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in Manila. 
100 years ago, the Great War raged throughout Europe. The order that had ensured peace on the continent was in tatters. And yet, undeterred by those oppressive times, German jurists took a step that rang with optimism: 
She underscored that trade incentives are not to be taken for granted, but that the EU also ties these to the observance of human rights standards. 
On 7 March 2017, the Philippine House of Representatives passed a bill to reimpose the death penalty and passed it on to the Philippine Senate for approval. 
I call on the Government of the Philippines to withdraw the conditions it has set and that to date have prevented Ms Callamard from conducting a country visit. 
Furthermore, Philippine Senator Leila de Lima has been in custody since 24 February. 
This future includes trade with the EU. 
I am deeply worried by this, because ever since it signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Philippines has been considered a close partner of those who, like the Federal Government, reject this inhumane punishment under all circumstances. 
International law for peace and justice 
Senator de Lima strongly criticised President Duterte’s “war on drugs” from the outset. I call on the President to put aside personal enmity and to instead focus on the future of the country. 
I demand that she be given the opportunity for a speedy and fair trial. 
She is among the strongest critics of the “war on drugs” and the thousands of killings that have been committed in this connection, along with the suspension of key aspects of the rule of law in the Philippines.

International law 
Germany’s commitment to international law remains strong 
they founded the German Society of International Law (DGIR) in 1917. 
At a special event in the Federal Foreign Office, Foreign Minister Gabriel congratulated the DGIR and thanked the international jurists for their dedication and hard work. 
He made particular mention of the Society’s members who served as judges on international courts and tribunals. 
This situation is highly regrettable, particularly in view of the close cooperation between Germany and the Philippines in the United Nations, for example in the fight against human trafficking, as well as on poverty reduction and international climate policy. 
Against this background, I see an urgent need for a visit by Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
Ties with Germany’s southern neighbour Austria are based not only on shared language and culture but also on a centuries-long and chequered shared history. 
The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation encompassed both Austrians and Germans and for several centuries the Holy Roman Emperors came from the House of Habsburg.

Clear and accepted rules are more vital than ever if we want to settle conflicts peacefully and make globalisation fairer. 
Numerous German companies have registered offices and production facilities in Austria. 
As neighbours, Germany and Austria maintain especially close political relations based on mutual trust. 
This is particularly true of their cooperation in the European Union, where both countries are calling for a fair distribution of the refugees among EU member states to resolve the refugee crisis. 
Differing views on the ways and means and occasional differences of opinion are quickly resolved. 
Because of the many similar political, economic and social challenges Germany and Austria face, interest in developments in the partner country is particularly keen. 
German cultural and academic exchange with Austria is probably more intense and wide-ranging than with any other country. 
Many German conductors, orchestras, musicians, singers, directors, artistic directors and actors work in Austria, and the same applies to Austrians in Germany. 
Vacancies for academic positions are often advertised across the border. 
Numerous German-Austrian film and TV co-productions, some of which have won awards, testify to the excellent cooperation in this area, too. 
The conclusion of the substantial restoration work was celebrated with a grand opening on 15 March.

German publishing houses hold shares in Austrian media companies, there are co-productions in radio, television and film and there is cooperation through the TV channels 3sat and arte. 
Owing to extensive media coverage of the partner country, there is much common ground and overlapping in public debate of political, economic, cultural and social issues. 
This tourist attraction in Ethiopia has now been reopened and can again be visited by Ethiopians and international guests. 
A temple for the Sabaean god Almaqah

The Great Temple of Yeha was dedicated to the Sabaean god Almaqah. 
They had a vision – academics and practitioners would be able, through their concerted efforts, to advance international law in a spirit of international understanding. 
The Great Temple was severely damaged, and large parts of it were destroyed, during a massive fire that occurred presumably during the middle of the first millennium BC. 
“Strengthening international law is a fundamental tenet of German foreign policy”, Gabriel stated. 
with berries 
It also serves as a pilot project for other cultural preservation projects in the region. 
The project is being co-implemented by the German Archaeological Institute and Friedrich Schiller University Jena. 
Or, as he himself put it in his inimitably pointed way in a note to Willy Brandt, 
he could, as Bahr wrote to Brandt prior to his speech in Tutzing, chime in with Brandt’s speech and say “controversial things” if “you were not able to say them yourself”. 
elaborating on the conceptional basis of the later “new Ostpolitik” of Willy Brandt’s SPD government. 
In 1963, the last year of Konrad Adenauer’s chancellorship, this was nothing short of revolutionary thinking. 
but rather had to do with the conviction that 
I wasn’t aware that you would have the speech published by the press office...” 
Bahr and Brandt, on the other hand, more than anyone else among Social Democrats, always held firm to the idea of a reunified Germany. 
Many people of my generation already took a different view. 
This is a combination that is still much in demand today, especially in such a complex and confusing state of global affairs. 
Egon Bahr’s piercing glance can help us enormously in our efforts to understand what is happening in our volatile world right now. 
If we genuinely want to understand the changes in the world, then we must first readjust our own measuring instruments. 
not only in economic terms, but also coupled with the, to my mind, entirely understandable desire to help shape our globalised world politically. 
We must acknowledge today that Russia yearns for a “post-western age”, that it is pursuing its foreign policy interests more aggressively and that it is restricting the freedom of dissenters on the domestic stage. 
And yet, from their firm position, they sounded out scope for cooperation where stable solutions were possible only with Moscow and not against Moscow. 
And we Europeans only have one genuinely unproblematic neighbour – 
“Consideration”, or so Egon Bahr wrote about the US, “has a limited term of application for tactical reasons. 
Consideration with regard to NATO is limited for reasons of practicality. 
Consideration with regard to the UN is only an issue when this organisation can be turned into an instrument for implementing American objectives. 
Consideration for Europe appears to be the least of Washington’s worries”. 
For decades, the dominant interpretation of Europe, especially shortly before election campaigns, also in this country, has been that Germany is the packhorse of the European Union and that we are net contributors. 
Cars, machine tools, steel and electrical engineering products are not manufactured in the low-wage sector, but relatively expensively, thank goodness. 
We therefore depend on Europe’s future development in all areas –politically, economically and culturally, as well for the preservation of peace and prosperity. 
When I hear about the many problems surrounding how to explain and make Europe a reality, then I sometimes wonder how difficult it must have been for the French, Danes, Belgians, Luxembourgers, Dutch and Italians to invite us Germans of all people to the table not long after the War and to build up a common Europe. 
voices that always mean us when we’re talking about Europe and which tell us that we should take the lead. 
Europe doesn’t consist of a single country with the others in tow, 
And we are discussing issues in Europe that Egon Bahr would have been aghast about. 
There is no justification whatsoever for the things that are happening in the region of the Baltic states. 
I think the opposite is the case. 
– and to pursue these visions. 
Landscape surrounding the village of Yeha 
The “Great Temple”, as it is called by locals in the small village of Yeha, was erected in the seventh century BC in the northern highlands of Ethiopia. 
The project includes a training component, for which experts work closely with the local population. 
A key focus of these activities is protecting and keeping alive local cultural identity. 
The German Government seeks to further increase the German presence in terms of quantity and quality - 
The OSCE offers jobs in the OSCE Secretariat in Vienna, with the autonomous OSCE institutions in Warsaw (Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights/ODIHR), The Hague (High Commissioner on National Minorities/HCNM) and Vienna (Representative on Freedom of the Media/ROFM), as well as with the numerous OSCE field operations such as the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine. 
Further information from the Federal Foreign Office 
At the end of 2016, 51 German nationals were working in the OSCE structures, 16 of them in field operations (not counting the SMM) and 35 in the Secretariat and institutions. 
At the beginning of March 2017, 27 out of 716 SMM monitoring staff were Germans. 
Fighting for a stronger Europe! 
It’s your birthday, Europe! 
a 2700-year-old temple reconstructed with help from Germany 
Together with Ethiopian colleagues, German archaeologists are protecting the local cultural heritage.

It was built by people who had resettled there from Sheba in present-day Yemen, in the style of southern Arabian temples. The remains of the temple are still standing and are 14 metres tall. It is the most important pre-Christian sacred building in East Africa. 
To preserve this piece of cultural heritage, the Sana’a office of the Orient Department of the German Archaeological Institute, together with the Ethiopian conservation authority, has been conducting substantial restoration work since 2009. 
Entrance to the Great Temple of Yeha, with newer graves in the foreground 
The sacred building is still visible for miles around today. 
The holy site was not only of religious significance, but also symbolised the power of the Dʿmt kingdom, which developed already early during the first millennium BC in the Ethiopian highlands. 
It was only thanks to a church being built inside the structure during the 6th century that the temple was not completely destroyed. 
The project is an outstanding example of successful German-Ethiopian cooperation in the domain of cultural preservation and with a view to developing this region for sustainable tourism. 
The restoration work received financial support from the German Archaeological Institute. 
A twelve-year, long-term project of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) supports academic research into the archaeology and history of the region surrounding Yeha. 
The UK will provide notification of its desire to leave the European Union in a few days’ time. 
This is a wakeup call. 
In addition to maintaining national export controls, the Federal Government has long endeavoured to coordinate and harmonize strict export controls under the aegis of the European Union and at international level. 
This is the actual significance of this anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. 
German chemical weapons material in Genoa 
In addition to maintaining national export controls with respect to war weapons, other armaments and dual-use goods, for which the Political Principles Adopted by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment of 19 January 2000 are the decisive policy guidelines, the Federal Government has long endeavoured to harmonize strict export controls under the aegis of the European Union and at international level. 
In particular, the Council Common Position of 8 December 2008 lays down the following eight criteria for assessing export licence applications: 
Respect for the international obligations and commitments of EU member states (e.g. sanctions, etc.); 
This is why the EU and its member states actively approach other countries (“outreach”) to campaign for export controls and, if necessary, help these countries to develop or improve their own export control systems. 
In this context, one priority is to advocate high standards for controls on transfers of small arms and light weapons, and to offer advice and support if needed. 
EU outreach activities 
The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (WA) entered into force on 1 November 1996. 
At present 41 states are members. 
These include all EU states (except Cyprus), plus Argentina, Australia, Canada, Croatia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the USA. 
The goal of the Wassenaar Arrangement is to prevent destabilising accumulations of arms by establishing effective and reliable national export controls and to improve transparency in the export of conventional weapons and dual-use goods by agreeing on reporting duties. 
It was built not with local sandstone, but with smooth blocks of snow-white limestone that had to be laboriously transported to the site from quarries near Wuqro located some 80 kilometres to the east. 
Following substantial restoration work and the grand reopening, this important historic monument can again be visited by tourists. 
And this was perhaps not all that apparent to him when he was giving the speech. 
Also because he, much earlier and more radically than others, tore down the facade of authoritarian states. 
This thought should also encourage us not to take the power game of self-styled strongmen at face value. 
Ernst Reichel, Germany’s Ambassador to Ukraine, today presented three high-resolution thermal imaging cameras to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. 
Until guns fall silent and heavy weapons are withdrawn from the line of contact, we will not make any headway in the political process, and those affected by the conflict will continue to suffer.” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel gave the following statement today (20 March) on the presentation of three thermal imaging cameras to the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine: 
These cameras will provide important around-the-clock situational awareness from the line of contact, and they will show us if efforts to implement the agreed ceasefire and troop withdrawal are finally moving forward. 
Nevertheless, the monitors still face numerous challenges and obstacles on a daily basis. 
These cameras, which are worth 172,000 euros, are part of the support that Germany is providing to the mission in the form of equipment, specialist personnel and training. 
Currently, some 721 international monitors are working in Ukraine. More than 600 of these are being employed in eastern Ukraine. 
Germany has seconded 32 monitors to the mission. 
Against this background, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Thursday (16 March) met with UN Special Envoy for Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. 
“in view of the devastating humanitarian situation in Yemen, the parties to the conflict must urgently return to the negotiating table.” 
Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, before the conflict broke out 
Severe famine looms 
Due to the conflict, seven out of ten Yemenites currently rely on humanitarian aid to survive. 
This has created the threat of severe famine. 
not much time to avert catastrophe 
“There is not much time to avert this catastrophe. 
Gabriel demanded that, 
I hope that the parties to the conflict know what is at stake,” the German Foreign Minister warned. 
High-level representatives of the parties to the conflict are scheduled to meet this week in Berlin. 
They want to search for ways to revive the stalled peace process. 
Support for Cheikh Ahmed 
Foreign Minister Gabriel meets with UN Special Envoy Cheikh Ahmed 
No European country, not even Germany, can do this on their own any more. 
The Mauritanian diplomat had previously led the UN’s ebola emergency response mission. 
We must close ranks in order to do this. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel commented on the meeting as follows: 
“We support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Cheikh Ahmed, who is engaged in talks with the parties to the conflict with a view to finding a solution to the conflict in Yemen.” 
Germany is the third-largest donor 
In 2016 alone, the Federal Federal Foreign Office made available more than 32 million euros to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population. 
More than one third of this aid went to the United Nations’ Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund, which channels resources to the aid projects of local NGOs. 
Fighting for Europe also means standing up for what we have accomplished. 
Dismantling our integration will not help us. 
Germany’s humanitarian aid in Yemen 
There has again been an increase in fighting along the western coast of Yemen since the beginning of the year. 
We will need to further deepen economic and monetary union to achieve this – 
Parties to the conflict scheduled to meet in Berlin 
The historic task that we now face is to create a better and stronger Europe. 
The situation of the civilian population is dire, and millions of people face starvation. 
The meeting is also intended to develop trust among the parties, so that compromises can be reached more easily at a later time. 
Support for the talks is being provided by the Federal Foreign Office, and they are being hosted by the Berghof Foundation, an organisation that promotes peace around the world. 
The meeting is part of a series of multi-party dialogues, and it has been closely coordinated with the UN Special Envoy. 
Germany is Austria’s most important economic partner by far, with bilateral trade worth95 billion euros a year. 
Austria is one of the most popular tourist destinations among Germans, who account for approx. 12 million visitors and 50 million overnight stays annually. 
The deep-rooted mutual understanding is reflected in the numerous political contacts between the two countries. 
The Austrian state broadcaster ORF often shows the same evening programmes as German TV stations. 
The admission of foreign, particularly German, students at Austrian universities remains a latent problem. 
In January 2007, the European Commission instigated a treaty violation procedure against Austria due to the quota system for those applying to study medicine and dentistry that Austria introduced in 2006 (75 percent of university places for Austrian citizens, 20 percent from other EU countries and 5 percent from other non-EU countries). This procedure has since been suspended. 
Austria maintains that without a quota for Austrian citizens a national shortage of practitioners looms because foreign students do not remain in Austria to practise. 
All in all, some 29,000 Germans are studying at Austrian universities and some 7900 Austrians at German universities. 
Most examination and degree certificates are mutually recognised (German-Austrian Agreement on the Recognition of Equivalencies in Higher Education of 13 June 2002, Agreement on Equivalencies in Vocational Training of 1990, EU recognition directives). 
Cheikh Ahmed was appointed Special Envoy for Yemen by the UN Secretary-General in 2015. 
We must invest together in the European Union and make the most important project for peace and prosperity of our age fit for the future. 
Mexico 
Alexander von Humboldt’s report on his trip to Mexico back in 1803 and 1804 heralded the start of Germany’s fascination with Mexico, undiminished to this day. 
Conversely, Germany has also traditionally been held in high regard in Mexico. 
Bilateral relations are very sound. 
The first meeting of the German-Mexican Binational Commission was held in 2015. The topics discussed were politics, sustainable development, the environment and climate change, science, research and innovation, business and energy as well as culture and education. 
Firstly, in European foreign and security policy. 
The aim of the commission is to steadily strengthen bilateral relations. 
The next meeting is scheduled to be held in Mexico in 2017. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel comments on presentation of three cameras to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine 
“I am pleased that, today, we were able to hand over several thermal imaging cameras to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. 
Only if the sides to the conflict finally guarantee the safety of the OSCE monitors and give them access to the conflict area can they monitor observance of the ceasefire in the long term. 
From 11 to 12 April 2016, Mexican President Peña Nieto came to Germany on a state visit, during which 13 agreements were signed on a range of topics including energy, climate and fighting corruption. 
This urgently needed special equipment will hopefully make the difficult work of the monitors easier. 
Mr Gabriel, how long will the Federal Government continue to let itself be insulted by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan? 
Germany is regarded as an important partner in Europe, of whom strong economic, political and cultural engagement in Mexico is expected, as well as close cooperation at multilateral level. 
Not everyone, I believe, has this privilege. 
There are also frequent high-level visits in both directions. In particular, business delegations from the German federal states are creating ever closer ties between the two countries. 
There are town twinning arrangements between Berlin and Mexico City and a partnership agreement between the federal states of Bavaria and Jalisco. 
A partnership has also been established between Rhineland-Palatinate and Aguascalientes. 
But I do believe we needn’t respond in kind to every provocation. 
Economic relations between Germany and Mexico show considerable momentum. In particular, Germany’s already substantial – and still growing – investment in Mexico features prominently in bilateral economic relations. 
But not reacting actually strengthens Erdoğan. 
He can then say, “here’s humiliated Turkey, and there is the arrogant West.” 
Our partnership with the USA and NATO are the cornerstones of the transatlantic community. 
However, the European Union must be able to cope with crises and conflicts in its neighbourhood by itself. 
Initial steps have been taken and further measures must follow. 
We must not bolster that friend-foe image. 
Borders have lost much of their significance within Europe. 
So are the entry restrictions that were imposed by the Dutch Government a mistake? 
To claim there is any similarity between the Netherlands, of all countries, and a fascist state, is entirely absurd. 
Anyone who holds Schengen dear must also value the protection of our external borders. 
In 2016, bilateral trade was worth some 17.83 billion US dollars. 
Europe must raise its game with respect to domestic security. 
Bilateral trade focuses mainly on the automotive sector as well as the chemical, pharmaceutical and electronics industries. 
Do you think it is right that Austria, too, is forbidding such political rallies? 
Germany is Mexico’s principal trading partner in the European Union. 
The fight against terrorism is a common effort. 
be it in Brussels, Paris, Berlin or elsewhere. 
More than 1900 companies with German participation are registered with the Mexican Economics Ministry, most of them in the automotive and automotive suppliers industry, as well as in the pharmaceutical, chemical and logistics sectors. 
Maybe my Austrian colleague’s intention is to do nothing less than what the Turkish President is doing with Europe, namely to exploit the difficult topic of relations between Europe and Turkey for the purpose of making political capital in his country. 
Turkey is Europe’s neighbour. 
German development cooperation with Mexico aims to help the country implement its ambitious development strategies in the following priority areas: sustainable energy (renewables/energy efficiency), environmental policy and the conservation of natural resources (urban and industrial environment protection and preserving biodiversity) and strengthening its influence as a regional player. 
However, too many people in Europe feel that they no longer benefit from a common Europe, but have been left behind. 
By directly supporting the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID) and through triangular cooperation arrangements, German development cooperation is helping Mexico to strengthen its role as a development partner for third countries in the region. 
We have to appreciate and take steps to counter this. 
For me, fighting for Europe therefore means strengthening the single market and taking the social dimension of the European project seriously. 
We need new conditions for growth and prosperity. 
We will need to continue to have relations with Turkey after the referendum, and vice versa. 
This includes European investments in digital infrastructure, as well as in education and research. 
We want to stand together in order to send a message from Rome that 
Erdoğan recently upped the ante: 
Germany is prepared to do just that. 
We won’t respond with rude comments, but we will draw clear distinctions. 
This date is a major crossroads for the most successful project for freedom, peace and prosperity that the world has ever known. 
This gives us cause for celebration. 
In view of the situation, the current level of aid is to be maintained in 2017. 
The financial crisis and our efforts to deal with the refugee movements have ruthlessly exposed the weaknesses of the European integration project. 
We have permitted Turkish citizens to cast their vote on the constitutional referendum on our territory, yet we have also made very clear that we can and will take all measures that may become necessary if Ankara does not respect German rule of law. 
What exactly does that mean? 
On Thursday (16 March), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met in Berlin with UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, expressing support for his efforts to bring peace to Yemen. 
However, because of sustained fighting and the fact that the infrastructure has been completely destroyed, and because considerable bureaucratic hurdles are hampering aid efforts, the urgently needed transport of food aid is being obstructed. 
Germany is the third-largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid to Yemen. 
They are all out to dismantle or even destroy Europe. 
In this world stricken by crises in which so many certainties have fallen by the wayside, the countries of Europe can only successfully defend their interests and values when they speak with one voice. 
Together, we are so much more and so much stronger than the sum of all of our individual nations. 
We must stand up for this both on the international and domestic stage. 
We overcame the sovereign debt crisis together. 
We are working to ensure that everyone in the eurozone is able to look ahead with confidence, that there is a return to growth across the board and that new prospects are generated with more jobs. 
Our work goes beyond this, however. 
Erdoğan has already done so. 
I’ve informed my Turkish partners accordingly. 
It is true that Europe must finally come of age. 
Section 90a is one such limit. 
Secondly, we need protection of Europe’s external borders that is genuinely worthy of the name. 
That is an amazing achievement – 
People in Europe should not have to live in fear – 
Freedom and security are two sides of the same coin. 
Anyone who violates the criminal code should know that they will not be permitted to proclaim their political views in our country. 
If we manage to deploy our resources better and, at the same time, if everyone is willing to tackle the necessary reforms to preserve their competitiveness, then we will not be net contributors and net recipients, but all net beneficiaries of Europe. 
Why do you permit Erdoğan’s envoys to come to Germany to campaign for doing away with Turkish democracy? 
After 60 years of Europe, we are standing at a crossroads once again, however. 
We must reach an understanding on what Europe means to us, where we want to go with the Union and what we are prepared to do to achieve this. 
This does not mean, however, that I consider the changes to the constitution to be without danger. 
What is your greatest concern? 
For me, it is clear that the path of European integration is both the right and the only path to take. 
This 60th anniversary must therefore stand as a beacon of hope and as a call to fight for Europe. 
We must not remain silent when voices clamour for an end to European integration. 
Fighting for Europe means defending our common, i.e. our European, values. 
We want to make the EU, which has brought us decades of freedom and stability, fit for the future. 
The rule of law and democracy, solidarity with one another and diversity among our member states are the building blocks of the European project. 
It is time to do away with the perception that we are not responsible for our own security. 
but strong external borders are equally important. 
While a number of measures have got off the ground, we must do more. 
This is a European task that applies to us all, and not to only those of us who are most affected. 
Despite bitter memories of their suffering under the German occupation during the Second World War, many Greeks feel an affinity with Germany and German culture. 
The economic crisis in Greece has again led to an increase in the number of Greeks coming to Germany. 
Many Greeks – including a number of prominent politicians, scientists and academics – also remember with gratitude that they were able to find refuge and support in Germany during the colonels’ dictatorship (1967-1974). 
In addition, a large number of Greek engineers and physicians received their training in Germany. Moreover, many Greek academics, and even leading figures in the country’s social and political life, have a good command of German. 
The economic crisis together with the refugee problem have had a strong impact on bilateral relations. 
Germany is seen here as a crucial actor in Europe, without whose support it will not be possible to master the challenges in Greece. 
Federal President Joachim Gauck paid an official visit to Athens from 5 to 7 March 2014. 
Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos held talks with Federal President Gauck and Federal Chancellor Merkel in Berlin on 18 January 2016. 
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras paid his first official visit to Berlin on 24 April 2015. 
He is frequently in touch by telephone with Federal Chancellor Merkel, who last visited Athens on 11 April 2014. 
The two countries’ heads of government and ministers also meet regularly at EU level. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Athens in January 2014, October 2015 and December 2016. 
Federal Economic Affairs Minister Gabriel visited Greece from 30 June to 1 July 2016 with a 40-member delegation comprising representatives of businesses and associations and members of the German Bundestag. 
The two Foreign Ministers signed the German-Greek Action Plan for bilateral cooperation in Athens in December 2016. 
Germany is supporting the reform process in Greece also in a European context via the European Commission’s Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS). 
Cooperation between the two countries’ municipalities and regions is being stepped up as part of the German-Greek Assembly (DGV). 
Since 2012, more than 300 contacts have developed between municipalities on both sides and a series of joint conferences have been held to strengthen knowledge-sharing partnerships. 
The next meeting is scheduled to take place in Sindelfingen in the autumn of 2017. 
In addition, during the visit to Germany by Greek President Karolos Papoulias on 12 September 2014, the two governments announced the establishment of a German-Greek Youth Office as a joint goal. 
The Youth Office is intended to promote youth exchanges between the two countries as well as foster mutual understanding and reconciliation. 
The debt crisis and public opinion 
The sometimes fierce debates and controversies, conducted in both countries in the media and among the general public since 2010, about Greece’s debt crisis and the “proper” way to overcome it have since faded into the background as a result of the huge pressures put on Greece by the refugee crisis. The Greek side sees Germany as a particularly helpful partner here. 
The Federal Government is helping to strengthen the dialogue between the two sides through frequent visits and discussion forums. 
An important contribution is also being made here by Germany’s political foundations, which have been active again in Greece since 2012. 
Our greatest concern is for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. 
Some CSU party members are demanding that German soldiers be withdrawn from Incirlik. 
It is helpful to remember that Turkey was not even excluded from NATO when it was a military dictatorship during the 1980s. 
So much for NATO’s much-professed community of values. 
At that time, Turkey would not have been a suitable member for the community of values. 
However, back then, as well, we did not want to lose Turkey to the old Soviet Union. 
We believed that the military dictatorship would come to an end. 
And that is what happened. 
The problems this would lead to are much more severe and would certainly have greater consequences for our children and grandchildren than the insults we are talking about today. 
Erdoğan is being quite tough in his attempts to use Turkish leverage on Germany. 
Let me give you one example from my home town of Goslar: 
A couple of years ago, I noticed that many apartments in an old working-class district were being bought by Turkish families that, for the most part, had been living in single-family homes in a newly-built district. 
I asked them, “Why are you moving from your single-family home to an apartment?” 
Here, we again have a community.” 
There are reasons, after all, why Erdoğan has such an easy time campaigning in Germany. 
German companies are active in Greece mainly in the retail sector, the pharmaceutical industry and in infrastructure projects. 
German companies are among the principal foreign investors in the country. 
Deutsche Telekom has a 40 percent stake in the partially state-owned Greek telecommunications company OTE. 
In addition to companies including Siemens, Bayer and Hochtief that have been operating in Greece for many years, retail companies such Lidl and Media-Saturn have an established presence in the country. 
A subsidiary of airport operator Fraport is set to operate and develop 14 regional airports that have so far been run by the government. 
A concession agreement to this effect was signed in December 2015. 
We have not managed to offer dual citizenship to people who have worked here for the past 30 or 40 years. 
I once met a 63-year-old father who pointed to his son and said: 
“You’ve given German citizenship to this young man, who has not yet done a thing for the country. 
I’m not even allowed to vote in the mayoral election of the town in which I’ve lived for decades.” 
Your first wife was Turkish. How much has this influenced your relationship to Turkey? 
I am very much a friend of Turkey. 
The 121 German companies operating in Greece employ a total workforce of approximately 29,000 and account for a turnover of some 7.3 billion euros (German Federal Bank figures for 2014, as of April 2016). 
Close cultural ties have existed between Greece and Germany since the time of the Greek struggle against Ottoman rule, which was supported by the philhellenes in Germany. 
Numerous German scientists, scholars and administrators went to Greece during the reign of King Otto von Wittelsbach (1833-1862), especially from Bavaria. 
The Turkish have strong emotions in both directions, that is, they are capable of great friendship and of great rejection. 
The pioneering research carried out by German archaeologists, the work done by German engineers to help develop the country and a general affinity for the German legal system forged strong ties in the academic sector that survived the two World Wars. 
This likeable and difficult country is close to my heart. 
Around 40,000 Greeks have received all or part of their vocational training in Germany. 
We have millions of people here in Germany with Turkish roots. 
They are great people. 
There are branches of the Goethe Institute in Athens and Thessaloniki, enriching cultural life in both metropolitan regions. 
They long ago stopped being so-called guest workers, and they have become citizens of our country. 
The German School in Athens, which looks back on an over 110-year tradition, has a German and a Greek section (with 1,060 students) and enjoys an excellent reputation. 
We must not let the electoral campaign in Turkey divide us. 
The same is true of the German School in Thessaloniki, which dates back even further. 
In addition, several private schools in Greece are helping to promote the German language. 
Now more than ever we need to show that we support the Turkish citizens who are here in Germany. 
We must tell them: 
“We are grateful to you, because you helped build up our country.” 
Have you ever felt that Turkey should be part of the European Union? 
Founded in 1874, the Athens branch of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) supervises important excavations in Olympia, at the Kerameikos Cemetery in Athens, in Kalapodi, on the island of Samos, in Tiryns (Peloponnese) and in Aegina. 
I discussed this with Erdoğan several times. He was still Prime Minister at that point. 
It maintains an extensive library and archive of photos. 
Even if Turkey were to meet all of the requirements. 
The EU was itself first in need of fundamental reforms, I insisted. 
The German Studies departments at the Universities of Athens and Thessaloniki is being supported with the secondment of three lectors. 
And what did Erdoğan say to that? 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has also operated a dedicated Information Centre in Athens since 2004. 
So far, more than 2,500 Greeks, mainly master’s and PhD students, have received DAAD scholarships and over 300 Humboldt research scholarships have been awarded. 
In the 2015-2016 winter semester, there were approximately 7,000 Greeks studying in Germany, excluding participants in the Erasmus programme, 3,800 of them resident and 3,200 non-resident students. 
The EU made a big mistake back then. 
In this situation, the EU should have opened the negotiating chapter on the judiciary and fundamental rights. 
Today, after the Brexit vote, the situation is entirely different. 
We are well-advised to establish a “special relationship” with the United Kingdom after it leaves the European Union. 
This will be an important learning process for the EU. 
Maybe some of those experiences can serve as a blueprint for other countries. 
In any case, EU membership for Turkey is today more out of reach than ever before. 
To put it plainly, I still have the right to choose who may insult me. 
What has been said over the past few weeks is so off the wall and absurd that it’s even hard to continue listening. 
it takes a lot of self-composure. 
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks have, after spending many years working or studying in Germany, returned home with positive experiences of their stay here. 
There are currently more than 300,000 people of Greek origin living in Germany, who are well integrated into German society. 
Worthy of note are the close contacts between the two countries’ legal experts, attributable to the fact that Greece adopted the German civil law code after gaining its independence in the 19th century and as many Greeks active in the legal profession studied in Germany. 
Political relations between Germany and Greece were for many years characterised by substantial agreement on international issues (such as the role of the United Nations, Middle East policy and the reconstruction of Afghanistan) and on fundamental issues relating to the European Union. 
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias paid his first official visit to Berlin on 10 February 2015 and returned for talks with Foreign Minister Steinmeier in January 2016. 
This Action Plan laid the groundwork for a further intensification of cooperation in the fields of politics, business, technology, academia, education, culture and civil society. Numerous cooperative projects have met with success for some time, including a joint German-Greek research programme, cooperation in vocational training and support with funding small and medium-sized companies. 
In the summer of 2016, Federal Minister Gabriel agreed two cooperative projects on renewable energies and to promote the export market, which have now got off the ground. 
German experts are currently providing assistance to the Greek Government within the framework of the European refugee policy, especially with regard to asylum procedures, coordinating aid to refugees and combating migrant smuggling. 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appointed Parliamentary State Secretary Hans-Joachim Fuchtel as DGV coordinator. 
The German occupation of Greece during the Second World War and the crimes committed by the Wehrmacht and SS during this period are still firmly etched in the memory of many Greeks and are also on the agenda of the governing SYRIZA/ANEL coalition. 
Many victims’ communities have invited German representatives to attend commemorative ceremonies and other events in recent years. 
Some 50 German-Greek societies in Germany are members of the umbrella organisation the Association of German-Greek Societies. 
With a bilateral trade volume of more than 6.6 billion euros, Germany was Greece’s most important trading partner in 2015. 
Major infrastructure projects such as the Athens Metro and the new Athens International Airport have been completed with the help of German companies. 
In 2014, the German-Greek Future Fund was set up to promote joint efforts to come to terms with this shared past and provide targeted help to victims’ communities that suffered most from the atrocities committed during the German occupation of the country in the Second World War. 
One in ten Greeks have lived in Germany for an extended period at some point in their lives. 
The branches of the Goethe-Institut in Greece hold more language examinations than anywhere else in the world. 
Sixty years ago, on 25 March 1957, the founding members of the European Union signed the Treaties of Rome. 
The European integration project is under greater attack today than at any time in the past, from within and from without, by populists who claim to have simple solutions and by autocrats who loathe our values. 
not in order to set ourselves apart from the others, but because we are more closely linked than ever before thanks to our common currency. 
Amidst the crises in our neighbourhood and the refugee flows, we can see how important effective protection of our borders is. 
Unfortunately, the Turkish side did not at all help to de-escalate the situation. 
Drawing a parallel between the Nazis and the Dutch social democrats unfortunately proves that, in politics, a race to the bottom is always possible. 
This is very short-sighted. 
Regardless of whether we like or don’t like what Mr Erdoğan is doing, 
Germany’s restraint has not had a great impact – Erdoğan has accused the Federal Government of using Nazi practices. 
Unfortunately, authoritarian individuals tend to interpret restraint as weakness. Maybe they even feel it confirms their actions. 
I can understand everyone who says: “Why don’t you put your foot down?” 
But in the end, such accusations are so ludicrous that we need not take them seriously. 
Reacting in kind only aids Erdoğan’s campaign effort. 
He claimed that the Federal Chancellor is attacking Turkey in the same way the Dutch police used dogs and horses to attack Turkish demonstrators. 
But my advice is to remain calm – even if it is difficult to do. 
This primarily concerns Turkish politicians holding rallies in connection with the constitutional referendum. 
Section 90a of our criminal code penalises anyone who insults or expresses contempt of Germany’s constitutional order. 
I told them that, if these developments continue, then we could be faced with a new situation. 
It is permissible to express criticism – even sharp criticism – of Germany, and certainly also about German politics. 
But there are limits, and these are imposed by our own laws, including by the criminal code. 
It is not only Turkey that deserves respect, but also Germany. 
Despite all the unfortunately justified criticism that is being made, no one, not even the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, is saying that Turkey’s referendum will effectively bury its democracy. 
There are presidential systems in other countries, too, where the Head of State can him or herself fire ministers and may issue laws by decree. One example is France. 
It is all the proposed constitutional changes, taken together, that worry us. 
If Turkey is truly a country under the rule of law, as Mr Erdoğan maintains, then I wonder how he can know and may claim, prior to any trial, that Deniz Yücel, a correspondent for Die Welt newspaper, is a terrorist and a spy. 
And others are even calling for our Ambassador to be withdrawn. 
We need Turkey for the Counter-ISIL Coalition, we need Turkey for Syria, and we must prevent Turkey from becoming an obstacle to efforts to stabilise Libya. 
Again and again, there will be a difficult and tense relationship between values and interests. 
President Erdoğan is exploiting the fact that many people in Germany with Turkish roots do not feel they have been truly recognised and accepted in our country. 
Their answer was: “We’ve done everything we could, but we simply did not blend in with the community. 
When you see Turkish flags at election rallies in Germany, is the first thought you have that we Germans made mistakes? 
But me, after 40 years of paying taxes and social security contributions, I don’t get that. 
You’re right. 
I told him that I believed the current state of the EU would make any enlargement extremely difficult. 
He said he was not absolutely insisting on membership for Turkey. What he wanted was for Turkey to be brought in line with European standards, so that his country would be modernised. 
Erdoğan succeeded, also by using the prospects of EU accession, in silencing the voice of Turkey’s military in Turkish politics. 
Ms Merkel, who was in a government coalition with the FDP at the time, along with the conservative parties in Austria and France, prevented this from happening. 
The former EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Günther Verheugen, is accusing Ms Merkel of sharing responsibility for the EU and Turkey drifting apart, because she did not pursue the accession negotiations in good faith. 
“We needn’t respond in kind to every provocation” 
We must do better in this area, through improved cooperation and better communication. 
Fourthly, we must be far more mindful of the fact that part of the European project's allure always was to do with the promise of prosperity. 
The single market brought prosperity to most of us, and over a long period of time. 
we Europeans are getting our act together and standing up for Europe and that we want to do a better job! 
We will succeed if we do not allow ourselves to be guided by our fears and if we revitalise the European spirit with courage and self-confidence and if we take everyone on board and challenge certain national sensitivities. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on German-Turkish relations and on the future of Europe. 
Published in the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper (20 March 2017). 
The Australia Group is the international export control regime for certain chemicals and biological agents, as well as dual-use goods and technologies, that can be used to produce biological or chemical weapons. 
I have enjoyed a long-standing and close affiliation with Turkey 
I am therefore all the more annoyed by the unspeakable accusations and absurd comparisons that we have heard from Ankara in recent weeks. 
The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war prompted ten Western states, including Germany, to start coordinating their national export controls for dual-use chemicals which could be used for the production of weapons of mass destruction in 1985. They also agreed to exchange information about procurement methods and to discuss options to curb the proliferation of such arms. 
The Federation is helping to conduct the referendum in Germany. 
In 1992, goods and technologies that could be used for the manufacture of biological weapons were added to the group’s remit. 
Annual plenary meetings are held under Australia’s chairmanship, with additional meetings convened as required. 
How is this in line with criticism of this plebiscite? 
The Group currently includes all EU member states, as well as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the USA (giving a total of 41 states plus the EU Commission). 
Why should we have an interest in denying those with Turkish roots in our country their right to vote in this decision of historic importance? 
And allow me to say something about German domestic policy, 
The sixth DGV meeting was held in Nafplio at the beginning of November 2016. 
I would welcome a greater level of respect for the achievements of those of Turkish origin living in Germany. 
The participating states have agreed to make the export of sensitive items contained in the Australia Group’s lists subject to national licences. 
I don’t think much of threats. 
Trust is the most important currency in foreign policy. 
I set great store by honesty and credibility, however. 
All other participating states are informed of export applications that have been denied by one of their number, and are obliged not to supply the same goods to the same recipient until they have consulted the state that denied the original application (no undercut). 
This is why we haven’t held back in our criticism of domestic developments in Turkey. 
“Die Welt” journalist Deniz Yücel is still being held on remand in Turkey. 
How do you rate the prospects for a solution in this case? 
We are working at all levels to help Deniz Yücel. 
Why is a Europe with different speeds of integration a successful model for the future? 
More information can be found on the Australia Group website. 
Currently 35 countries are parties to the Missile Technology Control Regime: 
The German Government attaches particular importance to the MTCR’s dialogue with non-member states, which seeks to encourage them to apply regime principles. 
There must be no “first-” or “second-class” Europe. 
The EU is and remains our common project. 
In addition, so-called Technical Outreach Meetings are held, at which the main features of the regime are explained to representatives of non-member states, and recent changes to the MTCR Annex are talked through by technical experts. 
Our Dutch partners were not in an easy position, considering they were in the final days of an intense national election campaign. 
This liberal country suffered greatly under the murderous actions of the Nazis. 
In order to enhance the efficacy of the MTCR as an international export control regime, Germany and its EU partners are together seeking the inclusion in the MTCR of all new EU member states which have not yet joined the regime (Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). 
Once again, however, it was not possible to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion at the latest MTCR annual meeting. 
The executives of political parties may still have a right to do this, but statesmen don’t. 
It’s true, this statement is completely disrespectful and inappropriate. 
Export controls in the nuclear field are based on the work of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and of the Zangger Committee, efforts that have been built on and implemented by EU rules and national legislation. 
Article 3 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) prohibits the provision of special fissionable material and of equipment and material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon state unless this material is subject to the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Today, we by no means want to push Turkey towards Russia. 
The Zangger Committee is however now less important than the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). 
The NSG, which currently has 48 member states, is an integral part of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
Since 1976, its guidelines have regulated the export of nuclear goods and nuclear-related goods, which are set out in two separate lists. The guidelines are implemented by the participating states in accordance with their laws and regulations. 
And I know how much affection they feel particularly for us Germans. 
I’ve always had reservations. But I was part of a minority in the SPD that held this view. 
I myself thought that Ms Merkel’s concept of a privileged partnership was misguided, because it would make the Turkish side feel like second-class Europeans. 
Germany played a key role in both the genesis of this Regulation and the weaving of the current fine mesh of its net. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel talks to the Spiegel news magazine (interview published on 18 March 2017). 
If we respond to provocations in a very severe way, then that only helps the Turkish President, because he needs a bogeyman for his campaign: 
The exchange of information concerning denials and other sensitive information is subject to confidentiality arrangements between the members of the Group. 
The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was established in 1987 by the governments of the then G7 states as an export control instrument to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons-usable missile technology. 
On Monday (20 March), Foreign Minister Gabriel opened the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue.

Minister Gabriel opens the BETD 2017 
Energy efficiency, renewables, phasing out of nuclear power - much is in flux in the energy sector right now, as Foreign Minister Gabriel underscored as he opened the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue. 
Not just in industrialised countries, but also in emerging economies and developing countries, renewables are becoming increasingly important. 
This is an important shift because 
We cannot combat climate change with fences and isolation, but rather with international cooperation, as Gabriel emphasised in the run-up.

Germany’s arms export policy thus also dovetails with the country’s foreign and security policy, which has the aim of preserving peace. 
To this extent, its arms export policy also promotes conflict prevention. 
European Union export controls 
EU Common Position on the export of military technology and equipment 
The Council Common Position of 8 December 2008 concerning the control of exports of military technology and equipment to non-EU states created a legally binding framework for arms exports by EU countries. 
It builds on the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports adopted by the Council on 8 June 1998, which had merely been politically binding, and which in turn was based on the Common Criteria for granting export licences agreed at the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils in 1991 and 1992. 
Respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law; 
Internal situation in the country of final destination, as a function of the existence of tensions or armed conflicts; 
Preservation of regional peace, security and stability; 
National security of the EU member states; 
Behaviour of the buyer country with regard to the international community, as regards in particular its attitude to terrorism and its compliance with international commitments on non-proliferation; 
Existence of a risk that the military technology or equipment will be diverted within the buyer country (e.g. to a terrorist organization) or re-exported to undesirable destinations; 
Compatibility of the exports of the military technology or equipment with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country. 
In addition, the Common Position retained the system established under the Code of Conduct whereby member states inform each other of cases in which applications for export licences have been refused (“denials”). 
If a member state wants to grant an export licence for a transaction that is “essentially identical” to one previously denied by another EU state, it is obliged to first consult that member state. 
This consultation mechanism increases the transparency of arms export controls among all EU member states, advances their further harmonisation and promotes the creation of a level playing field with respect to competition. 
EU Common Position on the control of exports of military technology and equipment 
Council Regulation of 5 May 2009 on the control of dual-use items 
This Regulation governs the export, transfer, brokering and transit of so-called dual-use goods, which can be used for both civil and military purposes. 
It is directly binding on all EU member states and thus contributes greatly to standardised, coherent controls in the EU. 
In particular, the Regulation helps EU member states to ensure that they comply with their international obligations with respect to non-proliferation, which derive above all from the international export control regimes described below. 
EU Dual-Use Regulation 
Outreach activities 
Export controls can only attain maximum effect if as many countries as possible apply comparable regulations and procedures and cooperate as closely as possible with the aim of implementing effective export controls worldwide. 
The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control has already been tasked repeatedly by the EU with organising outreach activities. 
Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) 
To this end, common lists of weapons have been drawn up, which are regularly updated and adapted to take account of the latest developments in military technology. 
In Germany these lists are incorporated into the national export control legislation. 
The member states carry out their own export controls in accordance with the agreed criteria and best practice guidelines drawn up by the WA, and inform each other as required about approvals and denials. 
Particularly strict guidelines are in force for small arms and MANPADS and for certain dual-use goods. 
More information can be found on the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) website. 
Export controls in the area of chemical and biological weapons-related goods and technologies (The Australia Group) 
Export controls in the area of missile technology 
Like the other export control regimes, the MTCR is not based on an international treaty, but purely on a political understanding among the participating governments. 
In the MTCR Guidelines, members pledge to control the transfer of equipment and technology included in technical lists (found in the Annex to the Guidelines, and divided into “Category I” and “Category II” items), which could in the recipient state be used for delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction – e.g. ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles/drones. 
There is a strong presumption that transfers of Category I items (complete rocket systems capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at least 300 km, as well as their major complete subsystems) will be denied. In other words, a transfer will only be approved on rare occasions where the possibility of misuse is basically ruled out. 
All other participants are to be notified of transfers that are refused (denials). If a state is asked to approve the delivery of the same items to the same recipient, it must first consult with the state that issued the denial. 
A Point of Contact has been established at the French Foreign Ministry to coordinate export control policy among the participating governments. This task includes notifying partners of denials. 
This dialogue is conducted by the rotating MTCR Chair at outreach meetings. 
The German Government will continue its efforts to develop the necessary consensus to enable these states to join the regime. 
Export controls in the nuclear field 
With this provision in mind, the Zangger Committee, established by 15 states at the beginning of the 1970s, has since 1974 maintained a list of nuclear materials and goods which can only be exported if the recipient state applies such IAEA safeguards. 
The guidelines contain conditions under which goods may be supplied. These and the lists of goods are constantly updated. 
For example, it is stated that transfers to non-nuclear-weapon states should only be made if the recipient state applies IAEA full-scope safeguards, i.e. safeguards covering all movements of fissionable material, and ensures adequate physical protection for the goods transferred. 
The aim is to stop the goods from being used for military purposes and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
Like the other export control regimes, the NSG is based not on an international treaty but on a political understanding and voluntary commitments made by the participating governments. 
The NSG chair rotates annually. 
Germany held it in 2008/2009. 
New investment opportunities are also emerging. 
This is the only way to avoid conflict over resources and underpin peace, stability and development in the long term. 
Input for the German G20 Presidency 
Guests from more than 90 countries attend the BETD 
This year marks the Third Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue. 
It is being hosted by the Federal Government together with the German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE), the German Solar Industry Association (BSW-Solar), the consultancy firm eclareon and the German Energy Agency (dena). 
We are a strong democracy and can take controversial discussions. 
This year, ministers, high-level delegations as well as guests from business and civil society from more than 90 countries are attending the conference. 
Energy policy 
and greatly value the country and its people. 
As part of its International Climate Initiative (IKI), the Federal Environment Ministry is funding bilateral and multi-country projects with the Mexican Government, including the German-Mexican Climate Change Alliance. 
We may be tolerant, but we’re not stupid. 
I at any rate don’t believe in a general prohibition on campaign appearances as some people are calling for, probably for political reasons. 
This referendum will set Turkey’s future course for many years to come. 
What options does Europe have in terms of bringing its influence to bear on Ankara? 
It’s easy to lose trust, but not easy to regain it. 
The dialogue between Germany and Mexico on development and environmental policy is conducted in a spirit of partnership thanks to the very good relations between the two countries. 
Anyone who puts critics behind bars and infringes the principles of the rule of law evidently doesn’t want to be part of our European community of shared values. 
However, we weren’t always honest with our partner in the past either. 
He’s one of our own. 
Europe seems more divided than at almost any time in the past. 
Europe has never moved at the same pace. In fact, it is incapable of doing so. 
The euro and Schengen are examples that show that it pays off when a few partners forge ahead. 
All in all, the schools are attended by nearly 6000 students. 
This is the only way to avoid stagnation as some aren’t ready yet. 
However, it’s important to keep the door open to everyone at all times. 
There are also schools in Mexico City, Puebla and Cuauhtémoc that offer instruction leading to the German Language Certificate (DSD). 
There is a growing demand for German as a foreign language, with some 75,000 people currently learning German in Mexico. 
Founded in 1966, the GI in Mexico City is engaged in intensive language work (with some 6700 people currently attending its courses) and also organises a high-quality, modern cultural programme. 
In addition, there are German-Mexican cultural centres in Monterrey and San Luis Potosí. 
The Cultural Affairs Foundation of German Business in Mexico City is funded by prominent German companies. 
The Turkish Government’s promise of consular access must be swiftly backed up with action. 
The Goethe-Institut (GI) plays a prominent role in cultural cooperation. 
In cooperation with the Goethe-Institut, it funds outstanding cultural projects with a broad impact in Mexico. 
A local Cultural Affairs Foundation of German Business has also been set up in San Luis Potosí. It supports projects by the local cultural society there. 
Since 2001, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has had a branch office in Mexico City, one of 15 worldwide. 
The wide range of activities being conducted across Mexico’s dynamic and flourishing academic landscape are supported by four lectors and a number of long-term and short-term lecturers. 
In addition to student counselling and the awarding of scholarships, work focuses on cooperation with the National Council on Science and Technology (CONACYT), the alumni associations and other Mexican partners. 
There are some 2800 Mexicans studying in Germany. 
With the motto "Towards a global Energiewende", the conference brings foreign and energy ministers from around the world together with guests from business, research, administration and civil society. 
Even now, more is being invested in renewables than in conventional energy; with the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the entire sector is experiencing a transformation which will have a long-term impact. 
As the Minister pointed out, the Energiewende has long been much more than just a German project. 
energy policy is not an issue that can be addressed within the confines of national borders. 
"environmental and climate protection, protecting resources and economic development are not opposite poles", but are two sides of the same coin. 
Political relations are close and friendly. 
Furthermore, as the Minister added, a sustainable energy industry is also a question of global justice. 
He went on to underscore that Germany wants to use this year's G20 Presidency to make progress on the long-term reduction of carbon usage in the energy sector - the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue is to provide new input to achieve this goal. 
Cooperation between the two countries takes place in the form of individual development cooperation and cultural projects and within the United Nations. 
Towards a global Energiewende: 
The Energiewende as a global project: 
The Energiewende success story 
The very word Energiewende barely even needs to be translated but has in fact found its way into international usage. 
For Minister Gabriel, it is particularly important that 
The Energiewende has opened up new business sectors, the development of renewable energies has created new markets, new value chains and jobs. 
To move the Energiewende forward, absolute priority is, for the Minister, attached to implementing the climate goals in Agenda 2030 and the 2016 Paris Agreement. 
It is especially trusting and successful in the area of climate policy. 
Economic relations with Grenada are relatively insignificant. 
There are direct flights between Germany and Grenada. 
Minister of State for Europe Roth visits Minsk 
Minister of State Roth was in the Belarusian capital Minsk on 13 and 14 March. 
Minister of State Michael Roth was in the Belarusian capital Minsk on 13 and 14 March. 
Twenty-five years after the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Belarus, Roth conducted political talks and opened the exhibition “Maly Trostenets extermination camp – history and remembrance”. 
To mark the 25th anniversary of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, Minister of State for Europe Roth met the Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei. 
The Republic of Belarus and Germany re-established diplomatic relations on 13 March 1992. 
Exactly 25 years later, Minister of State for Europe Roth met the Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei in Minsk to mark this anniversary. 
Roth and Makei stressed the importance of these relations to both countries but also addressed critical issues in a frank and constructive discussion. 
A tax information exchange agreement with Grenada entered into force in November 2013. 
Other cooperation and trade accords exist within the framework of the agreements between the European Union and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) states as well as between the EU and CARIFORUM (CARICOM member states plus the Dominican Republic). 
Grenada, like the other countries of the region, is paying very close attention to the further development of trade relations with the EU in the light of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) that was signed in October 2008. 
He stated that the rule of law and abolition of the death penalty, currently the greatest obstacle to Belarus forging closer ties with the Council of Europe, were of special importance. 
The only significant source of revenue from Germany is tourism, an industry that recorded growth in the past year. 
The destruction caused by the 2004 Hurricane Ivan (90 percent of the island was devastated, including numerous hotels) can still be felt today. 
Maly Trostenets: German-Belarusian history 
It was for this reason, and also on account of the global economic and financial crisis, that the country’s economic development suffered substantial setbacks. 
In development cooperation, Grenada is the only island state in the Eastern Caribbean engaged in bilateral cooperation with Germany (through the projects Integrated Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Grenada and Reform of the Electricity Sector to Support Climate Policy in Grenada). 
Through agreements between Germany and the Caribbean Community CARICOM, the two countries are also engaged in joint projects on the promotion of renewable energy and adaptation to climate change (e.g. reafforestation of mangrove forests). 
In addition, Germany provides assistance through micro-projects and sports promotion measures. 
Grenada’s main exports to Germany are agricultural products (including cocoa and spices). 
Nicaragua 
Minister of State met the survivor Kurt Marx at the opening of the exhibition. 
Besides the German Embassy, the following German institutions are active in Nicaragua: the German-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the bilingual German School, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), KfW (Reconstruction Loan Corporation) and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. 
This German influence can be felt even today, particularly in the coffee-growing region in northern Nicaragua. 
In addition, more than 20 German non-governmental organisations are active there. 
There are close historical ties between the two countries, especially through German immigration during the 19th century. 
The fact that relations with Belarus have never been so diverse or broad-based is not a given in the light of Germany and Belarus’ shared history. 
Around a thousand German nationals live in Nicaragua and several hundred Nicaraguans in Germany. 
No end to the confrontation with Turkey is in sight – would you be prepared to forbid Turkish politicians from making campaign appearances in Germany? 
With this in mind, I made it quite clear to my Turkish counterpart that this crossed a line. 
This is why we have told our Turkish partners most clearly that, 
if they want to campaign here, then they must stick to our laws. It won’t work otherwise. 
which is that some of the objections to holding the referendum in Germany appear to me to be quite arrogant and paternalistic. 
We offered them a privileged partnership whereas Turkey was working towards EU membership, for example. 
I know many Turkish people who are disappointed by this and who don’t want to feel like second-class Europeans. 
It would be truly sobering should it turn out that we can no longer be able to count on the Turkish Prime Minister’s promise to the Federal Chancellor. 
The aim of this sectoral programme is to strengthen national institutions in this area so as to ensure sustainable management of national water resources and improved access to affordable and qualitatively adequate drinking-water and sanitation services for the general population. Through regional programmes, Germany is also supporting the development of renewable energies. 
He said that the aim was to anchor Trostenets as a European centre of remembrance in the eyes of the public. 
Minister of State Roth was especially moved by the words of the survivor Kurt Marx, born in 1925, whose parents were murdered in Maly Trostenets in 1942.

In conversation: Minister of State Michael Roth with students in Minsk 
These shared experiences show how important exchange and dialogue are. 
Dialogue was thus the focus of an intensive and lively discussion with students from various Belarusian universities. 
Minister of State Roth called the cooperation between the civil societies of the two countries the “cornerstone of good relations”. 
Trade between the two countries is developing slowly but steadily from a low level. In 2015, it was worth just under 112 million euros. 
Nicaragua’s main exports to Germany are agricultural products and its main imports are manufactured goods. 
Nicaragua records a negative balance of trade with Germany. 
A growing number of German tourists are discovering the land of lakes and volcanoes as a holiday destination. 
Around 17,000 Germans currently visit Nicaragua every year. 
The German companies Ritter Sport and Dräxlmaier are among Nicaragua’s biggest employers. 
Nicaragua was a priority country of German development cooperation until the end of 2011. The main aim of German engagement there was reducing poverty. 
With aggregate development cooperation worth 1 billion euros, Germany has so far been one of the country’s principal bilateral donors in this area. 
Among other measures, Germany cancelled Nicaragua’s bilateral debts totalling 492 million euros in June 2004 under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. 
Cultural relations between Germany and Nicaragua are good. 
Otherwise, Nicaraguans have a positive but rather vague picture of Germany. 
There is scarcely any news about Germany in the local media. 
Cultural ties are close. 
The two countries enjoy very good relations based on mutual trust. 
Many Germans are familiar with Nicaragua through the books of Gioconda Belli, Ernesto Cardenal and Sergio Ramírez. 
In Nicaragua, the main contacts for those wishing to learn more about Germany are the German School, the DAAD lector and the German-Nicaraguan Cultural Initiative (ICAN). 
The German School in Managua (Colegio Alemán Nicaragüense), which is funded by the Federal Government, has more than 800 German and Nicaraguan students. 
In April 2016, the school was awarded the title Excellent German School Abroad for the second time. 
In higher education, cooperation focuses on the DAAD’s University Staff Development Programme in Central America. 
There is a DAAD lector working in Nicaragua 
This cultural centre enjoys a good reputation well beyond the city’s borders and in February 2017 again hosted a number of cultural events organised as part of the annual International Poetry Festival. 
These friendly relations have been underscored by numerous high-level visits. 
He said that the partial lifting of the visa requirement by Belarus on 12 February was a positive signal which would help cultivate exchange, especially among young people and students in Germany and Belarus. 
Minister of State Roth made it clear that the potential for cooperation between the two countries had not yet been exhausted.

Furthermore, funding was made available for a new archaeological Museum in La Trinidad which is due to open in 2017. 
In response to growing democratic deficits in Nicaragua, such as the controversial elections in November 2011, the Federal Government decided to restrict official development cooperation to the priority area water. 
There is also extensive and long-standing non-governmental cooperation through churches, private bodies, political foundations and numerous town-twinning arrangements. 
German immigration to Nicaragua in the 19th century made a contribution to the country’s development that is widely appreciated to this day. 
Since the 2003 school year, students there have been able to obtain the Bachillerato Internacional, a qualification which enables them to study at institutions of higher education in Germany.

Human Rights Commissioner responds to conviction of a human rights activist in Saudi Arabia 
It is unacceptable for people to be locked up for expressing political opinions. 
I call on the Saudi Arabian Government to defend its citizens’ right to freedom of expression. 
Unhampered dialogue with the various groups within civil society is not a threat to national security. 
freedom of expression strengthens a society and makes it more resistant to extremists. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (14 March) in response to reports about the renewed conviction of a human rights activist in Saudi Arabia: 
I am shocked to hear that Issa al‑Hamid, a member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), has again been convicted and sentenced to many years in prison. 
The conviction is now final. 
Issa al‑Hamid is a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA). 
Since the organisation was banned more than three years ago, many of its founding members have been arrested and handed long prison sentences. 
The accusations levelled at them include criticism of the government, incitement to protest and membership of an unauthorised organisation. 
A Specialised Criminal Court in Riyadh sentenced the Saudi Arabian human rights activist Issa al‑Hamid to eleven years in prison and to a travel ban of a further eleven years.

Statement by Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Bärbel Kofler to mark World Water Day 
For the period 2016-2017, Mexico and Germany are carrying out comprehensive programmes to showcase themselves in the respective partner country. 
while Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier opened the Year of Germany in Mexico, during which 1000 individual events are planned, in Mexico City on 6 June 2016. 
The Mexican-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CAMEXA) estimates German companies’ aggregate capital to be worth around 35 billion US dollars. 
In 2015, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and AMEXCID set up a fund financed in equal parts by them, from which individual projects aimed at supporting reforms in the spheres of good governance, the rule of law and human rights are funded. 
Mexico is a priority country for German cultural relations and education policy and all Germany’s major cultural organisations are active there.

Waste water which has been thoroughly treated is both an affordable and sustainable source of water and energy, as well as nutrients and recyclable materials, that we can no longer do without. 
In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly for the first time passed a resolution that officially recognises a human right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation. 
The Federal Government supports the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Léo Heller, in order to raise the profile of human rights. 
Furthermore, the Federal Government supports plans to improve the efficiency of the global water architecture, as part of a forward-looking foreign policy that can identify and defuse at an early stage conflicts that arise also due to ever scarcer resources. 
Diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever and polio, which still cause many fatalities every year, can to a large extent be attributed to dirty drinking water and poor sanitation.

There are also German Information Centres in Osh and Jalalabad. 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) runs an information centre in Bishkek. 
Historically, the German minority in Kyrgyzstan figures prominently in bilateral relations. 
The first settlements of German Mennonites in the country date back to the 19th century. 
Another wave of immigration began in the 1950s, this time from Siberia when banishment ended. 
The Federal Government offers support to the members of the German minority, especially in the social, cultural and education sectors. 
Giving Kyrgyz citizens of German extraction prospects for the future was a major objective of the framework declaration adopted by independent Kyrgyzstan and the Federal Republic of Germany on 4 July 1992, which marked the beginning of intensive cooperation between the two countries. 
In the same year, a German diplomatic mission was opened in Kyrgyzstan. 
As the first EU country with a fully fledged embassy in Kyrgyzstan, Germany is the country’s principal partner in the European Union. 
Then Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Bishkek from 31 March to 1 April 2016 and the Federal Chancellor was there from 13 to 14 July 2016. 
Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt's trip to Bishkek in October 2016 highlighted the two countries' mutual interest in cooperation in the area of agriculture. 
Overall, bilateral trade is insignificant, with a large trade surplus in Germany’s favour. 
Germany’s principal exports to Kyrgyzstan are motor vehicles, machinery and chemical products (pharmaceuticals and cosmetics). 
Kyrgyzstan’s main exports to Germany are agricultural products. 
Overall, there is little investment activity by German companies. 
The aim is to provide long-term support to promote the country’s stable and sustainable development. 
The principal points of reference here are the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Kyrgyzstan’s national development strategy. 
Other major topics in the development portfolio are climate, good governance and gender justice. 
Kyrgyzstan’s National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2013-2017 is being followed up by a development strategy for the period 2018-2022. 
As a preferred partner, Germany will assist in drawing up the new strategy. 
Financial Cooperation focuses on two main areas: 
expanding the microfinance sector and local infrastructure, especially in rural areas, in order to increase local added value and employment; 
Financial Cooperation also supports emergency medicine, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis prevention as well as helping to improve the health of mothers and children. 
A programme to improve energy efficiency will be successfully concluded in 2017. 
In bilateral Technical Cooperation, the Federal Government is mainly engaged in a programme to promote sustainable economic development and vocational training. 
Projects are also being conducted in the following areas: maternal and child health, climate and biodiversity and vocational training. 
The aggregate amount of bilateral Technical and Financial Cooperation provided since 1993 runs to nearly 306 million euros, 
making Germany one of the country’s principal bilateral donors. 
For bilateral measures, funding worth 37.95 million euros was made available for development cooperation with the Kyrgyz Republic. 
The next intergovernmental negotiations are scheduled for 2017 in Berlin. 
At some of these schools, students can obtain the German Language Certificate Level II. 
However, measures to promote German in Kyrgyzstan are meeting with growing difficulties: 
with the promotion and increasingly widespread use of the Kyrgyz language in teaching and the growing popularity of English at the country’s schools, the number of German learners is declining. 
Since 1998, there has been a German reading room at the National Library in Bishkek, co-supervised by the Goethe-Institut in Almaty. 
The DAAD regularly awards research and study scholarships in Kyrgyzstan to Kyrgyz students, scientists and academics. 
The number of DAAD scholarship holders is constantly growing: in summer 2015, 94 scholarships were awarded to Kyrgyz nationals. 
The DAAD has lectors working at several universities in Bishkek. 
There are also numerous university partnerships between the two countries, which are likewise funded by the DAAD. 
Every year, a total of approximately 1 million euros is spent on scholarships for Kyrgyz students and academic support in Kyrgyzstan. 
In April 1999, a DAAD alumni association was set up by former DAAD scholarship holders, 
and in early 2005 an alumni association was established by former Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellows. 
The German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) has concluded rebroadcasting agreements with numerous radio and TV stations across the country to rebroadcast DW satellite radio and TV programmes.

In order to achieve this, Kollhoff decided to retain the structure and outer appearance of the building. 
The floor plan and interior design were conceived with the needs of the Federal Foreign Office fully in mind and geared towards modern office and communication standards. 
In the opinion of the Federal Foreign Office, the design by young architects Thomas Müller and Ivan Reimann, which came second place, was the one that best reflected these requirements. 
Key measures to achieve these aims include the following: 
Prof. Hans Kollhoff 
October 1997 – November 1999 
(Construction within budget) 
Conference centre, press briefing area, offices 
Following the decision by the German Bundestag to move the seat of government to Berlin, the Federal Government, in close consultation with the Berlin Senate, decided in 1995 to make the Haus am Werderschen Markt the Head Office of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Alongside their individual impact as works of art, Kollhoff considered these ceiling and wall designs to be an artistic treatment of the two former functions that the building performed. 
The building needed to take the prominent historical context into account while at the same time making its own contribution to the urban development of central Berlin.

The inclusion of the public space will be a key part of documenta 14. Projects will thus also take place in public sites around the city. 
Refugees and migration, finance policy and relations between the EU and Turkey – Greece plays a central role in many key issues affecting Europe. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is therefore in Athens for talks on 22 and 23 March. 
If you send us a message via the contact form or via email, the message and your email address will only be used for correspondence with you. 
Shortly before the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, the visit also signals the strong cohesion within Europe. 
The sovereign debt crisis is again dominating the political debate in Greece. 
Financial crisis: Greek politicians and the Greek people have achieved much 
Gabriel stated that a lot had happened since the start of the financial crisis and that much had been achieved through reforms. 
Gabriel added that the task now was to continue following this path. 
Cohesion within the eurozone will not be the only issue discussed during Gabriel’s trip. 
In the sphere of refugees and migration, Gabriel’s visit will focus on the refugee flows in the Aegean Sea and Turkey’s role in the refugee issue. 
Divided Cyprus will also be discussed – the negotiations on this have been deadlocked since February. 
The documenta will take place for the 14th time in 2017 – for the first time both in Germany and abroad. 
From 8 April until 16 July, there will be events in Athens, and from June to September the exhibition will take place as usual in Kassel. 
The main exhibition site in Athens will be the National Museum of Contemporary Art, which was founded in 2000 and is housed in a former brewery. 
Alongside the political talks, cooperation in the cultural sphere will also be on the agenda. 
He went on to say that Germany had great respect for what Greek politicians and the Greek people had achieved. 
Documenta 14 in Athens 
Foreign Minister Gabriel will therefore visit the National Museum of Contemporary Art and meet the director of documenta 14 before travelling back to Berlin on Thursday evening. 
The two countries are both interested in the swift conclusion of the forthcoming credit reviews. The Minister stressed that Germany stood firmly by Greece’s side. 
Finance policy will also be a main focus of the talks scheduled for Thursday with the Greek President, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, and Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias. 
25 March marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome and the founding of the European Community – of which Greece became a key member state. 
IS is on the retreat everywhere. 
In Iraq alone, more than one and a half million people have been able to return to areas freed from the clutches of the terrorist militia. 
For a long and difficult road still lies ahead for people in Iraq and Syria before the terrorists have been driven out for good. 
Although the latest military successes against IS are crucially important, it is clear that the fight against IS cannot be won by military means alone. 
In Washington, therefore, we pledged a further 235 million euros for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation to help people in Iraq and Syria. 
After increasing Germany’s support for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation in Iraq and Syria by 235 million euros, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel made the following comments in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on the occasion of the meeting in Washington of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS: 
It is especially important now that the international community’s support for the fight against IS remains firm. 
Germany is already making a crucial contribution towards these key stabilisation measures and we intend to continue this year. 
Cuba 
Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Cuba in July 2015, 
the very first visit to the country by a German Foreign Minister and an important step towards intensifying German relations with Cuba. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel: 235 million euros for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation in the fight against IS 
This confidence can only be generated if booby-traps are cleared in the liberated regions, the drinking water and power supplies restored and progress is made in rebuilding local administrative structures. 
And, of course, this will require schools and jobs. 
In February 2016, the first in a series of regular political consultations, which were agreed upon during Steinmeier’s visit, were held in Havana. 
Since the visit to Cuba by Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier in July 2015, talks on setting up a German Business Office in Havana have taken place and considerable progress has been made. 
Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel visited Cuba in January 2016 with a large business delegation. 
In 2015, German exports to Cuba were worth approximately 237 million euros, while Cuban exports to Germany amounted to 45.7 million euros. 
Germany’s principal exports to Cuba were grain, machinery, chemical and pharmaceutical products, plastic goods, medical equipment, motor vehicles and vehicle parts. Cuba exported alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and honey as well as fruit and vegetable juices to Germany. 
Other focuses of the Deutsche Welle Academy’s work are expanding citizen’s radio in Kyrgyzstan and training young journalists in Central Asia, which is being conducted in Bishkek in cooperation with the OSCE Academy. 
Of the roughly 100,000 ethnic Germans living in Kyrgyzstan in the early 1990s, an estimated 8000 have remained in the country. 
Kyrgyzstan’s President Almazbek Atambayev visited Berlin in April 2015 and February 2017. 
Actors such as the Delegate of German Industry and Commerce for Central Asia are promoting the development of economic relations. The German Business Day, co-sponsored by the Federal Government, is to be held for the second time in March 2017 and aims to provide important momentum. 
At the intergovernmental consultations between Germany and Kyrgyzstan in May 2012, sustainable economic development and healthcare reform were confirmed as the priority areas of bilateral development cooperation. 
and helping Kyrgyzstan implement its national healthcare reform programme in cooperation with several international donors. 
The economic development programme is helping the Kyrgyz government – in tandem with the private sector – to improve overall economic conditions and other factors affecting the country’s competitiveness with a view to effecting structural change that creates jobs and generates income. 
In addition, Kyrgyzstan is provided with consulting services through regional projects, such as the project Support to Legal and Judicial Reforms in Central Asia and a project to promote regional cooperation on trade. 
Germany also contributes substantial funding to the programmes of multilateral institutions (Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Commission and World Bank). 
At the intergovernmental negotiations on development cooperation held on 30 June and 1 July 2015 in Bishkek, the course was set for cooperation over the next two years (2015/16). 
To promote the German language, as part of the Schools – Partners for the Future initiative, Germany’s Central Agency for Schools Abroad and the Goethe-Institut are providing special assistance to a total of eight schools in various Kyrgyz cities, including seconding teachers from Germany.

That must have been difficult to justify 
But it was a great and courageous step, 
which benefits us all today.

to their own peoples. 
Since 2000 there has also been a language-learning centre coordinated by the Goethe-Institut in Almaty offering professional German language courses and further training for teachers throughout the country. 
During the Second World War ethnic-German citizens of the USSR, mostly from the Volga region, were also forcefully resettled in Kyrgyzstan. 
In 2015, Kyrgyz imports from Germany were worth almost 51.1 million euros, while exports to Germany amounted to a mere 12.8 million euros. 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier issued the following statement on 22 March on the attack in London: 
Another important element in bilateral economic relations is German tourism in Cuba. 
This has been picking up again since 2011: 
in 2015 nearly 175,000 of the total of 3.5 million foreign tourists that visited Cuba came from Germany, 
an increase of approximately 25 per cent, 
At Cuba’s instigation, bilateral development cooperation was discontinued in 2003. 
The German Embassy in Havana supports a number of micro-projects every year, most of which are implemented through church-affiliated organisations. 
Several German NGOs are engaged in Cuba. 
The Welthungerhilfe has been active there since 1993, 
At this difficult time we Germans feel especially close to the British people.” 
its work focusing on food security and on emergency relief measures – for example, following Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012. 
Between 2011 and 2014, it also conducted a regional project on poverty reduction and natural resource protection in the border zones of protected areas. 
“I am deeply shocked by the news of the murderous attack in London. 
My thoughts are with the victims and the injured, as well as with those mourning or fearing for a loved one. 
The Welthungerhilfe also conducts EU-funded projects in the above sectors. 
Another organisation that has been supporting projects in Cuba for a number of years is the German NGO KarEn e.V. (Association for Promoting Alternative Energy in the Caribbean). 
These projects are mainly aimed at improving the electricity and water supply for people and animals with the help of renewable energy. 
The German Adult Education Association is active in Cuba’s adult education sector and 
Cultural and academic exchange and cooperation in science and research are cornerstones of bilateral relations. 
A cultural agreement between Germany and Cuba that was negotiated back in 2003 has yet to be implemented. 
However, talks on the conclusion of such an agreement were resumed in 2015. 
There is so far no Goethe-Institut in Cuba either, but the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has a representative there. There is also a language learning centre operating under private law. 
Nevertheless, Germany is involved in major international cultural events in Cuba – for example, Havana’s International Book Fair (at which it is represented by a Frankfurt Book Fair stand and readings by German authors), the organisation of German Theatre Weeks and the establishment of a German section at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema. 
Of particular importance are the exchange and practical networking between Cuban cultural workers and Germany’s cultural scene. 
Young dramatists and directors from Cuba have been able to complete guest stints at German theatres and Cuban film-makers have been invited to participate in the Berlin International Film Festival and the affiliated Berlinale Talent Campus. 
On the German side, there is keen interest in dialogue with Cuba, and the same is true of guest performances in the theatre, film and music sectors. 
The estimated 30,000 Cubans who have studied or worked in Germany, especially in the former GDR, constitute an important element in cultural exchange. 
The principal Cuban partner in language learning is the Cuban Association of German Teachers. 
Interest in learning German as a foreign language continues to outstrip the courses available. 
The possibility of setting up private language schools, which have been allowed in Cuba since 2011, is something Germany has taken advantage of (see above). 
Every year, a small number of Cuban teachers of German and German students/lecturers receive grants enabling them to attend further-education courses in Germany. 
The Peter and Irene Ludwig Foundation has its own office in Havana, which is mainly active in artistic exchange. 
Another area of considerable importance is cooperation in science and research, in which an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation scholarship programme (mainly aimed at scientists) and several partnerships between German and Cuban universities play a major role. 
This is the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. 
I personally am still impressed 
a further 235 million euros in stabilisation and humanitarian aid 
He went on to say that “It is especially important now for the international community’s support to remain firm.

The Syrian city of Raqqa is also on the verge of being liberated. 
Reconciliation and stabilisation 
Despite this, Foreign Minister Gabriel warned that 
Germany’s priorities

IEDs also need to be removed, and people need to be given access to work and education. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel underscored this aspect: 
“People will only return home if they have confidence in a bright and better future.” 
The international community’s concerted efforts to counter the terrorist group are having an effect. 
Life after the reign of terror 
The commitment to provide an additional 235 million euros in stabilisation and humanitarian aid was made at a meeting of the Global Coalition against Daesh in Washington. 
“IS is retreating on all fronts,” Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel commented on Germany’s decision. 
We therefore support the Iraqi Government’s efforts to bring about reconciliation and economic stability, and we are pressing for a political solution in the Syria conflict. 
The Coalition Working Group on Stabilisation is co-chaired by Germany and the United Arab Emirates. 
60 years of the Treaties of Rome - Europe, a success story

For us, firstly and most importantly, it means 
Never before has there been such a long period of peace in Europe – 70 years now. 
The additional funds in the amount of 235 million euros are to be used to achieve these goals and to help the population live in freedom and security, once IS’s reign of terror has ended. 
Efforts in Iraq focus on strengthening the regional governorates, restoring the water and energy supply, rebuilding roads and promoting peaceful coexistence of the various population groups. 
Differences of opinion are no longer resolved on the battlefield, but in an institutional framework. 
The fight against IS: 
Germany is increasing its funding for aid to people in Iraq and in Syria. 
A long and difficult road still lies ahead for people in Iraq and in Syria.” 
IS on the retreat 
IS is losing more and more territory. Many of its strongholds, such as Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah, have been liberated, as have considerable sections of the large city of Mosul. 
For this, the founding members transferred some of their sovereignty. 
European cooperation was the 20th century’s greatest project for civilisation, the Minister said, and it had helped to overcome animosities and conflicts in Europe. 
EU citizens in numerous cities in Europe – here by the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin – are calling for a strong EU.

It also ensures equal opportunities and protection for the individual: 
workers enjoy comprehensive protection against discrimination at work and in the application process. 
Expectant mothers enjoy special protection, and companies are not allowed to form cartels to dictate prices. 
All this is guaranteed, thanks to the EU. 
The EU is a success story. 
To mark the anniversary, the 27 Heads of State and Government of the member states and the EU institutions will gather in Rome to reaffirm their commitment to the joint European course. 
They will acknowledge the achievements made in the process of European integration and formulate a perspective for the coming years. 
One thing, though, is clear: 
Asia’s emerging economies will occupy a key position in this recalibration of the world. 
I am therefore convinced that 
we need to redefine our policy on Asia. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel writes to European Commissioner Malmström. 
The current structures still reflect in part the bipolar, Cold War global order. 
However, that can only be a first step. 
With that in mind, we want to further expand our existing partnerships in Asia and push forward on new agreements. 
According to the two companies involved, the investigation led by the US Department of Commerce wrongly accuses European companies of dumping when they sell steel products in the United States. 
This policy realignment must be flexible enough to take account of all facets of this complex continent. 
At the same time, it must be firmly oriented to the values to which we adhere and which we wish to defend. 
More and more frequently, the paths to solutions to the global issues facing us lead through Asia. We therefore need openness and cooperation.” 
The EU single market is the world's largest internal market. 
Background information: 
With 38 embassies and consulates, we already have a dense network in Asia. 
On 25 March, the whole of Europe will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties establishing the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, the Treaties of Rome. 
In signing these documents in Rome in March 1957, the Heads of Government of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg laid the foundations for a project which, along with the European Coal and Steel Community, was to develop over six decades into the world’s biggest project for freedom, peace and prosperity: the European Union. 
Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (l.) and the State Secretary of the Federal Foreign Office, Walter Hallstein, sign the Treaties of Rome in the Palace of the Conservators on the Capitoline Hill in Rome on 25 March 1957. 
The celebrations provide an opportunity to look back on this grand project and to remind ourselves of what it actually means to be a citizen of the European Union. 
This was made possible by the decision of the European states, in the wake of two devastating World Wars, to focus on what they had in common, to prevent war in Europe for good and to find a peaceful form of cooperation. 
The EU is also celebrating great success as an economic area. 
With its 500 million people, the single market is an attractive trading partner. 
The EU single market is a key instrument to secure employment and prosperity for Europe’s citizens. 
That is why we want to continue along the path of cooperation, working together to find solutions. 
At the beginning of this month, the European Commission presented its White Paper on the Future of Europe, which looks at Europe’s greatest challenges and opportunities and sketches out five scenarios for the development of the EU over the next ten years. 
The European Commission has also marked the anniversary with the publication of 60 Gründe für die EU (60 Reasons for the EU). 
Now we want to ensure that our structures and organisation in Berlin are geared even better than before to Asia as an important focus of our foreign policy. 
"There is reason to fear that the American rivals of these two companies are hoping that the new US Administration could be prepared to allow US companies to engage in unfair dumping even if this violates international law. 
At the same time, he called for the companies to be self-confident. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel presents the case for the German steel industry in dispute with the United States 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel today (24 March) wrote a letter to the European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström presenting the case that the Commission unequivocally call upon the US Administration in its current talks to respect WTO regulations in force. 
In the United States, an anti-dumping investigation is currently underway in the steel sector affecting, inter alia, the German companies Salzgitter AG (Lower Saxony) and Dillinger Hütte (Saarland). 
"The Dilllinger Hütte and Salzgitter AG steelworkers produce high quality steel and have nothing to fear from fair competition. 
Politics has the job, if necessary, of confidently presenting the case for this fairness and to retain jobs and of fighting side by side with the steelworkers," as Gabriel pointed out. 
The EU and Germany are advocating that the US Administration apply WTO regulations when calculating anti-dumping duties. 
Calculation methods which run counter to WTO agreements could potentially lead to the companies paying higher duties and thus facing huge competitive disadvantages internationally. 
The Federal Government has thus presented the case at various levels of the US Administration that recognised, fair rules be applied in the investigation. 
The investigation due to be decided soon will be the first anti-dumping investigation in the steel sector concluded by the new US Administration. 
"That is why I believe it to be extremely important to take a clear position now to prevent starting the transatlantic business dialogue with the new US Administration with a negative and unjustified decision," as Federal Foreign Minister Gabriel wrote to Malmström. 
Germany supports Armenia’s efforts to move closer to the EU (as part of the Eastern Partnership) and NATO. 
Armenia’s President Serzh Sargsyan visited Berlin in April 2016, meeting with Federal Chancellor Merkel. 
We Europeans must not accept this," Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel explained. 
As a member of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group, Germany supports the Minsk Group Co-Chairs’ efforts to negotiate in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, calling for de-escalation and urging both sides to show greater willingness to compromise. 
Germany supports this process at civil-society level by funding cross-border reconciliation projects. 
We must intensify our relations with Asia and shape them more strategically in order to do even greater justice to the ever-growing importance of this region, with its population of over four billion and its rapidly expanding markets. 
That is why I have decided to establish the first ever Asia Directorate-General at the Federal Foreign Office. The aim is to harness our regional competences more effectively and develop them further. 
It is high time they were adapted to take account of Asia’s increasing importance. 
As an importer of Armenian products, it occupies fifth place, behind Russia, Bulgaria, Georgia and Canada. 
Bilateral trade between Germany and Armenia remains modest in absolute figures. 
We need reliable rules for free and fair trade which creates jobs both here and in Asia and which respects social standards. 
Furthermore, we want to do even more for conflict prevention in the region, as well as to strengthen regional institutions and to promote multilateralism. 
In close cooperation with the artist Gerhard Merz, Kollhoff developed an art concept integrated into the conversion, lending the building renewed freshness and colour through the use of predominantly monochrome surfaces in important parts of the building. 
In 2016, Armenian exports to Germany stood at 139 million US dollars (down from 145 million US dollars in 2015). 
It complements the adjacent old building well as it adopts the latter's heights and lines. 
The establishment of the Asia Directorate-General is to be backed up with linguistic and cultural training programmes, as well as initiatives to enhance regional expertise and cross-sectoral knowledge of the region. 
German exports to Armenia were worth 186 million US dollars, a drop of about 10 percent compared with the previous year. 
Health Service, Directorates-General for Legal and Consular affairs, Culture, the United Nations, administration 
Germany’s principal exports to Armenia were motor vehicles, machinery, chemicals and electrical engineering products. Its main imports from Armenia were iron, steel, copper, molybdenum and other metals, as well as textiles. 
At the intergovernmental negotiations on development cooperation held in November 2016, Germany pledged up to 54 million euros for financial cooperation. 
In addition, new funding was made available in 2014 for regional projects in which Armenia is involved. 
The aims are to ensure greater coherence in our policy on Asia through improved coordination, to expand our contacts with Asian partners at all levels, and to enhance our competence with an eye to this important continent. 
We also want to promote the creation of flexible pools of experts and to foster exchange on the subject of Asia both among the ministries here in Germany and within the EU. 
A total of up to 21 million euros is being provided within the framework of technical cooperation and up to a million euros in financial cooperation for regional projects. 
Since 2010, official German development cooperation with the Southern Caucasus region (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) has been conducted exclusively through regional programmes under the Federal Government’s Caucasus Initiative. 
The Caucasus Initiative priorities are sustainable economic development, energy, the environment, developing democracy and the rule of law and strengthening local administration. 
Ongoing German development cooperation projects with Armenia therefore concentrate on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, developing and reforming the financial sector, improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy and regional power exchange, the sustainable management of natural resources and the establishment of nature conservation areas. 
Efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law focus on creating a functioning, independent legal and judicial system by providing expert advice on legislation, jurisprudence and application of the law. 
Other goals are the development of democracy at local level, administrative decentralisation, more efficient public finance management and the promotion of civil-society participation in political decision-making processes. 
In addition, there are projects aimed at modernising the water, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure. 
The microprojects supported by the German Embassy in Yerevan focus on providing assistance to kindergartens and promoting the participation of people with disabilities in society, as well as on further-education and rehabilitation measures in the medical sector. 
Initial plans to construct a new building were shelved for reasons of cost. 
In the course of the necessary renovation works, Berlin architect Hans Kollhoff, who was commissioned as general planner, faced the challenge of achieving a critical distance from earlier usages of the building without completely blotting out this history. 
In close cooperation with the authorities for heritage conservation, selected rooms and sections of the building dating from the 1930s, 50s and 70s were preserved. 
Windows and skylights that had been bricked over when the building was used by the Central Committee of the GDR were reopened in order to allow more natural light to permeate offices and conference areas. 
When the competition for the extension – which was necessary on account of a lack of space – was announced in 1995, a strong emphasis was placed on an architectural style that opened up to the city. 
As a uniform cubic building broken up by three atriums, it fulfils both the functional requirements of the Federal Foreign Office and the express desire for openness. 
The choice of architectural materials and forms (including atriums and glass façades) compensates for the old building's serious appearance and creates a convincing overall impression with transparency and lightness. 
A building-specific energy-saving concept was developed for the new Federal Foreign Office in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin and the Gesellschaft für Ökologisches Bauen. 
Limiting heating consumption with a thermal insulation system in the old building 
A solar thermal system was also set up on the roof of the extension.

Armenians derive their sense of identity in large part from their ancient culture steeped in history. 
Culture is therefore an important factor in bilateral relations. 
The main goal of Germany’s cultural relations and education policy in Armenia is to promote German as a foreign language at both school and university level. 
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Federal Office of Administration - Central Agency for Schools Abroad (ZfA) have their own German staff working in Armenia. 
The language centre in Yerevan, which opened in early 2012, also includes a German reading room and the office of a Goethe-Institut consultant for teaching German. 
Literary, musical and other events, which are organised in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut in Tbilisi/Georgia, which serves Armenia, and the German Embassy in Yerevan, are designed to convey a modern and realistic picture of Germany and intensify contacts between those active in the cultural sector in the two countries. 
There are 26 partnerships between German and Armenian higher education institutions, in particular long-standing ties with Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, where the MESROP Centre for Armenian Studies was established in 1998. 
Contacts between the two countries in the cultural and education sectors are close. 
Armenia’s Education Minister makes regular visits to Germany. 
There is a lively exchange between schools in Saxony-Anhalt and Armenia, with seven school partnerships currently in place. 
I very much welcome the fact that both you and Ambassador Kerll are committed to this cause and am looking forward to the results of the white paper, which I would be delighted to discuss with you. 
Permit me to wish you and PEMACS every success for the future. 
Many thanks for your letter of 9 March regarding the Euro-Mediterranean-Arab Partnership for Cooperation and Security (PEMACS).

Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the floods in Peru 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (25 March) on the severe flooding in Peru: 
I am delighted that this initiative is making progress and concur that broad-based consultation with all social actors in the Mediterranean and Euro-Arab region is of great importance. 
Only when all parts of the population are included will we be able to develop viable political approaches and new forms of cooperation in the region. 
Gernot Erler on the demonstrations in Belarus 
Current developments in Belarus are extremely worrying. 
State Secretary Ederer receives US Governors 
State Secretary Markus Ederer received the Governors of Kentucky, South Dakota and Oklahoma for talks at the Federal Foreign Office on Friday, 24 March. 
We have already taken action to provide assistance. 
Regarding the actions that Belarusian authorities have taken against peaceful demonstrators, the question arises as to their proportionality. 
The US states are also actively involved in these efforts. 
Gernot Erler, the Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (24 March) on the large number of demonstrators who were arrested during socially motivated public protests: 
It is time for the Belarusian Government to release, as soon as possible, all peaceful demonstrators, including the journalists, who are in administrative detention, in accordance with the demand made by the European Union on 21 March. 
Moreover, I expect the Belarusian authorities to take a measured approach towards the Freedom Day demonstrations that have been announced for tomorrow, 25 March. This means there should be no use of force in connection with the demonstrations. 
The freedom of public assembly and of expression are precious rights that must also be respected in Belarus. 
The images from Peru and the magnitude of the severe flooding speak a clear language. 
We grieve with the families and friends of the victims and we feel for the many people who have lost everything. 
We will not leave the Peruvian Government to deal with this difficult situation on its own. 
I would like to commend all helpers from Peru and the rest of the world for the work they are doing in the current emergency. 
Background information on the assistance being provided

The reform process in Cuba and the future of German-Cuban relations were the focus of the visit, which included a meeting with Cuba’s President Raúl Castro. 
State Secretary Ederer held discussions with his American guests on transatlantic cooperation in vocational training. 
The objective of the Skills Initiative is to improve vocational training in the US in order to better meet industrial companies’ demand for skilled workers. 
thus putting Germany in third place among the countries of origin, after Canada and the United States (including visits by Cuban exiles). 
In 2000, a bilateral debt restructuring agreement settled the matter of Cuba’s foreign debts to Germany. This also made it possible to resume Hermes export credit guarantees. 
However, following the visit to Cuba by Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier in July 2015, talks commenced on resuming bilateral development cooperation and concluding the relevant framework agreement. 
Since then, there has been neither technical nor financial cooperation. 
the German Cooperative and Raiffeisen Confederation has commenced cooperation aimed at providing advice to the country’s increasingly important cooperative system. 
The representative of the DAAD has a lectorship office in Havana, which focuses mainly on the cooperation between around 58 Cuban and German universities and organises German classes at the foreign languages department of Havana University. 
The major impact which climate change can already have on people is evident time and again. 
Germany is making available bilateral assistance totalling up to 225,000 euros within the framework of an emergency aid project in cooperation with the German Red Cross (water supply and treatment; reconstruction of houses/roofs to provide protection from further rainfall). 
The German Embassy in Lima will initiate measures to the tune of 50,000 euros (emergency household kits for 700 people, equipment and material for local disaster relief/health care facilities) to help those affected. 
In September 2016, the Economics Summer School – the result of a cooperation project between the Humboldt University and Havana University – took place for the 14th time. It was supported by the German Institute for Economic Research and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. 
The Federal Foreign Office is promoting the dialogue on vocational training in the United States. 
The three Republican Governors had travelled to Hamburg and Berlin on a three-day trip dedicated to the dual system of vocational training. 
Bilateral relations, the EU’s economic and political role and continued efforts to promote free and fair trade were also on their agenda. 
The German Embassy in Washington has promoted vocational training for over five years via the Skills Initiative, which connects German companies in the region with training centres and other vocational training providers. 
German-Spanish relations are close and friendly and are fostered by the positive basic attitude of each country’s population towards the other. 
Federal Chancellor Merkel last visited Spain on 25 August 2014 at the invitation of Prime Minister Rajoy. 
She hosted a return visit by Prime Minister Rajoy to Meseberg on 31 August 2015. 
Federal President Joachim Gauck last visited Spain at the invitation of the Spanish King and Queen on 1 February 2017. 
Economic relations 
In 2016, German suppliers continued to benefit from strong demand for investment goods and consumer durables. 
Germany is a major direct investor in Spain. 
Tourism also plays a key role in the two countries’ economic relations. 
In 2016, 11.2 million Germans visited Spain, making them the third-largest group of tourists, after the British and the French. 
Germany has branches of the Goethe-Institut in Madrid and Barcelona, with branch offices in Granada and San Sebastián. 
The German Archaeological Institute has a department in Madrid, which is responsible for Spain, Portugal and North Africa. 
There are more than 1500 formal cooperation agreements between the two countries’ universities. 
German and Spanish institutions are engaged in numerous joint research projects, underlining the intensity of the cooperation between Germany and Spain. 
A key player here is the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation with its close-knit alumni network. 
Since November 2011, the German Academic Exchange Service has run a new Information Centre in Madrid and has nine lectors and six language assistants working at Spanish universities. 
There are seven German Schools in Spain – in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Malaga, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas – that offer the German university entrance examination (Abitur). 
In addition, there are two language learning schools (in San Sebastian and Seville), as well as two German vocational schools (in Madrid and Barcelona). 
With a total of more than 8000 pupils (including kindergarten children), these schools bolster intercultural relations. 
The schools receive long-term assistance in the form of teachers seconded from Germany and material support. 
Besides the 11 above-mentioned schools, Germany’s worldwide network of partner schools (PASCH) includes another 13 schools in Spain. 
Over eleven million German tourists visited Spain in 2016. 
Germany is Spain’s second-largest trading partner after France, and actually ranks first among suppliers of the country’s imports. 
According to Deutsche Bundesbank figures, 1313 German companies (with a balance sheet total of over three million euros; 2022 according to the Spanish statistical office INE) have subsidiaries or holdings in Spain, many with their own production facilities. 
Germany and Spain enjoy vibrant and intense cultural relations. 
Germans continue to display a great interest in Spanish language and culture, particularly literature and cinema. 
The Embassy and consulates supplement this work with their own high-profile events and via initiatives that seek to promote German language classes at Spanish schools. 
The Federal Office of Administration - Central Agency for Schools Abroad has seconded a professional adviser for the Iberian peninsula with the aim of acquiring further schools offering the German Language Certificate (DSD) of the Standing Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
Approximately 130,000 Spaniards live in Germany today while recent estimates put the number of German nationals living in Spain on a permanent basis, i.e. for more than three months a year, at well above 500,000. 
The two countries enjoy a close bilateral dialogue. 
Among Spaniards, the economic crisis has led to a sharp increase in interest in Germany (including in the labour market and the dual system of vocational education as a tool for fighting youth unemployment) and the German language. 
German Government steps up international engagement in the dual system of vocational training 
Many countries are struggling with the consequences of high youth unemployment and the shortage of skilled workers. 
The German vocational training system is regarded as a successful model throughout the world and the demand for cooperation with Germany is growing steadily. 
The German Government’s strategy is to interlink the activities of the four federal ministries involved in international vocational training. 
This has been successful and the German Government now intends to further expand its long-standing engagement. 
This was the decision taken by the Federal Education Ministry, the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Economics Ministry and the Federal Development Ministry at a conference held in Berlin today. 
Each of the ministries involved has increased its own contribution to cooperation on vocational training during the last few years. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development fosters the development of efficient vocational training systems in developing countries and emerging economies. 
“Industry needs qualified workers. 
That’s why we are getting our worldwide network of German chambers of commerce abroad involved in cooperation on vocational training. 
Maria Böhmer, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, stated: 
“The dual training principle offers great advantages. 
Through our engagement in vocational training, we are making an important contribution towards stabilising societies and cultures.” 
Dr Friedrich Kitschelt, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development said: 
“Vocational training is an outstanding hallmark of our development policy. 
Well-trained workers, who master their professions and their lives with their hearts, minds and hands are key to sustainable development. 
We have again massively expanded vocational training during this legislative term and on average invest more than 75 million euros annually in the training of young people in developing countries. 
Around two million people have gained vocational qualifications during the last few years as a result of this. 
International bodies are also attaching greater importance to promoting vocational training. 
Many challenges remain: 
The German Government’s advisory strategy therefore places considerable importance on involving companies and the social partners in shaping vocational training. 
Even when politicians regard the dual system of vocational education as a good model, more has to be done to convince young people, parents and employers. 
Support is provided to German companies which operate internationally to help them train their skilled workforce locally. 
The German Government’s strategy ensures that German players involved in vocational training abroad speak with one voice. 
GOVET was set up as a central point of contact for international cooperation in vocational training and is much used both nationally and internationally. 
The Federal Foreign Office organises round tables at numerous German missions abroad on coordinating the various activities, exchanging experiences as well as ensuring a unified strategy in host countries. 
Dirk Wiese, Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy: 
It raises training standards and boosts a country’s economic performance. 
The dual system opens up to young people new career options, a wider range of vocational prospects and a greater chance of social and economic participation. 
Germany shares its expertise and is taking on responsibility. 
Moreover, the image of vocational training is not good in many partner countries and often compares unfavourably to that of a university education. 
The German Government’s international engagement is supporting the efforts of partner countries to expand and improve their training systems as well as to enhance the employability of young people. 
Finally, German vocational training also benefits from the experiences of other countries and through learning together gains impetus for the further development of the German system. 
Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier visited Armenia from 29 to 30 June 2016 as part of a trip to the Southern Caucasus. 
Saxony-Anhalt’s State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology is conducting projects in Armenia. 
Conference on international vocational training paints positive picture/Vocational training abroad, however, often not granted due recognition 
Improving vocational education is therefore a political focus in these countries. 
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research is gradually expanding its strategic partnerships with industrialised countries and emerging economies in order to foster training courses which can serve as a model as well as strategy projects between the social partners. 
By promoting German chambers of commerce abroad, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has created a platform for the dual system of vocational training based on the German model. 
“We advise states both within and outside Europe on how vocational training can take place not only in schools but also in companies”, said Georg Schütte, State Secretary at the Education Ministry. 
“The aim is to establish the principle of in-company training in the education system of partner countries, to involve companies and to give them responsibility for training young people.” 
Through skills experts, we are helping German and local companies to provide demand-oriented in-company training for young people locally.” 
We support the work of the GCTF and its institutions. 
In Tunisia alone, 12,500 men and women were able to greatly improve their chances on the labour market. 
This issue is also receiving more attention at G20 summits. 
in many partner countries the inclusion of companies and the social partners in vocational training is still inadequate, as companies, chambers of commerce or trade unions are traditionally not involved in training young people. 
We welcome the Life Cycle Initiative with its interactive tools, as well as the clearing house mechanism for improved coordination of the member states’ activities. 
It is thus helping to tackle the causes which lead people to leave their home regions or migrate. 
We support the new structure of the GCTF working groups, the focus on implementing the extensive recommendations and closer cooperation with other organisations. 
This will help to make the GCTF even better prepared to meet current challenges. 
We firmly believe that close cooperation with regional organisations such as ASEAN, the AU, OIC, OSCE and others can make a tangible difference. 
These organisations have great potential as well as expertise. 
The GCTF should continue to use all available scope to work even more closely with UN organisations in order to avoid duplications of efforts and to create synergies. 
It is anchored in several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the demonstrations in Belarus 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (28 March) on the demonstrations in Belarus: 
The people who took to the streets on Saturday and also in recent weeks have exercised a right that is indispensable for a pluralist society. 
There must be no further unjustified arrests and sentences only because people say what they think. 
The action taken by the Belarusian authorities against peaceful citizens demonstrating for important social issues sends a challenging signal. 
The responsible authorities must not only respect the right to peaceful demonstrations and the freedom of opinion, but must also ensure that people are able to exercise these rights. 
Those who are still in administrative detention must be released as swiftly as possible. 
We remain committed to good and thriving relations on the basis of common interests and our European values. 
An open society must tolerate a plurality of opinions and be capable of withstanding a dialogue on critical questions. 
there is no denying that these developments represent a setback. 
Close historical, cultural and economic ties have existed between Germany and Finland since the Hanseatic era and the Reformation. 
After the Second World War, the traditionally good relations between Finland and Germany were soon restored, to begin with mainly in the economic and cultural spheres. 
Official bilateral relations were resumed in 1953 with the setting up of trade missions in Cologne and Helsinki. 
Federal President Joachim Gauck paid an official visit to Finland in July 2013, during which he visited Savonlinna, Naantali and Turku accompanied by Finnish President Sauli Niinistö. 
On his most recent visit to Germany in October 2014, President Niinistö attended the Frankfurt Book Fair, at which Finland was Guest of Honour. In February 2015, 2016 and 2017, President Niinistö attended the Munich Security Conference. 
Finnish Prime Minister Sipilä travelled to Berlin in September 2015, as did Foreign Minister Soini in October 2015 and November 2016. 
In August 2016, Prime Ministert Sipilä met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and his Swedish, Danish and Dutch counterparts in Meseberg. 
Close contacts also exist between the two countries’ federal and Land parliaments. 
The German-Nordic Parliamentary Friendship Group in the German Bundestag has maintained long-standing ties with the Finnish-German Group of Parliamentarians in the Finnish Parliament. 
German Bundestag President Norbert Lammert visited Finland in July 2014 at the invitation of Finnish Parliament Speaker Eero Heinäluoma. 
Germany is one of the main destinations for Finnish investment. 
The activities of German companies in Finland have increased in recent years. 
Some 300 German companies currently operate in Finland, including many well-established companies. 
A German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce was set up in 1978 
and now has around 700 Finnish and German member companies. 
However, since around 1960 German has ceded its status as the principal foreign language to English. 
Besides fostering the German language, a key concern of German cultural policy in Finland is promoting Germany as a place to study. 
The Helsinki-based Goethe-Institut in Finland makes a significant contribution to lively cultural exchange. 
Other major pillars of cultural relations are the German School and the German Library in Helsinki and the German Lutheran community in Finland, all of which were established back in the second half of the 19th century. 
In the non-governmental sector, there are many players active in cultural exchange. 
In addition to numerous visits and personal contacts between artists, scientists and academics from the two countries, a wide range of cultural exchange programmes are conducted by the more than 30 Finnish-German cultural associations in Finland as well as by the more than 70 local chapters of the German-Finnish Society – one of the largest bilateral societies of its kind in Germany – and the Berlin-based Finnish Institute in Germany. 
Activities are also carried out as part of the more than 70 town and municipality twinning arrangements, including exchanges for secondary school students and young people. 
Germany remains a popular study destination for Finnish students. 
Taking violent action against this is out of proportion. The same goes for the many arrests of protesters and journalists in their midst. 
Diplomatic relations between the Republic of Finland and the Federal Republic of Germany were established on 7 January 1973. 
The quality of German-Finnish relations is also reflected in the numerous consultations on a wide range of issues and the good personal contacts at the political level. 
There is also intensive exchange between the two parliaments’ committees. 
For example, the Finnish Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee travelled to Berlin in February 2017. 
Germany is currently Finland’s principal trading partner, with imports from Germany amounting to 8.2 billion euros and exports to Germany worth 7.5 billion euros in 2015. 
The same year, Finland recorded a balance of payments deficit of 427 million euros in trade with Germany. More than 80 percent of imports reach Finland by sea, the German seaports of Hamburg, Rostock and Lübeck playing a key role. 
Around 280 Finnish businesses have invested in Germany, mainly companies in the paper industry (Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene Oyj and Metsäliitto) that are already well established in Germany. 
The influence of the centuries-old traditions of Finnish-German relations still makes itself felt especially in academic life, culture and jurisprudence. 
Well received is the support provided in this area by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), which has lectors working in Helsinki and Turku, the Educational Exchange Service (PAD), which has a German language consultant there, as well as the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and other cultural intermediaries.

Germany will be actively involved in various events which are part of the celebrations throughout the year. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the security policy conference of the SPD parliamentary group “Impetus for a European defence union” 
Wolfgang Hellmich, Rainer Arnold, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, 
Many thanks for your invitation and many thanks to all those who helped to prepare this conference. 
At the weekend, we celebrated the anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. 
However, the fact that this was difficult shows that we have reached a critical point. 
This is partly to do with Brexit. 
Incidentally, we must, with regard to security policy, have a strong interest in keeping relations with the UK as close as possible. 
This is obvious particularly in the realm of foreign, defence and security policy. 
Above and beyond this, many intensive discussions are being held on the various models of integration and cooperation. 
And you can tell quite quickly how unstable the situation is wherever the European Union’s hand of peace is absent. 
I believe that we are also witnessing great political differences between Central Eastern Europe and Western Europe when we consider the developments that we see in Poland and in Hungary. 
It is also tempting as we are, more and more, being called upon to take a leading role. 
This is about the whole of Europe. 
We want us to stick together here. 
The paradox here is that while Europe is getting more important on the one hand, it is dogged by so many difficulties on the other. 
but are also getting closer to us – both on our eastern and on our southern borders. 
All of this is keeping us immensely busy. 
We are feeling the consequences of this directly. 
We are being forced to deal with refugees and increased migratory flows. 
Europe is navigating a state of global affairs that has seldom seemed so complex and threatening. 
60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome - Europe, a success story 
For us, firstly and most importantly, it means peace. 
“Nowhere in the world can people live as freely and with as much democracy as in Europe,” was Foreign Minister Gabriel's summary recently at a European policy workshop with the public at the Federal Foreign Office. 
“That’s something worth caring about.” 
“Our children and grandchildren will only be heard in the world if Europe speaks with one voice,“ stressed Gabriel. 
On 25 March, the whole of Europe celebrated the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. 
The European Union means peace 
In March 1957, the foundation stone was laid in Rome for a project which was to develop into the world’s biggest project for freedom, peace and prosperity: the European Union. 
Today in the Federal Foreign Office, tribute is being paid to a foreign minister who decisively shaped Germany's history: 
The Federal Foreign Office is remembering its former head by holding an international symposium and officially opening the Genscher Foyer. 
…Gabriel und Barbara Genscher… 
A "Titan among diplomats" who, if need be, could be "as tough as the leather of a Texas cowboy boot" - that is how former US Secretary of State James Baker remembered his German counterpart. 
For almost two decades, Hans-Dietrich Genscher was Germany's face in the world. 
Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (left) and State Secretary Walter Hallstein sign the Treaties of Rome 
Courage and far-sightedness 
„Die Idee… 
I cannot imagine how anyone would seek to define security and defence policy objectives and instruments without having a common perception of foreign policy. 
Foreign policy must therefore precede security and defence policy. 
We will only be able to deal with all of the crises and conflicts if we Europeans undertake common efforts across the board. 
By the way, it is quite interesting to ask people 
In a joint declaration they expressed their determination to tackle the challenges facing Europe together and strengthen the European Union in future through even greater unity and solidarity amongst them and respect for common rules. 
One of the first answers they give is 
“foreign, security and defence policy”. 
“We have united for the better. Europe is our common future.” 
It is most fascinating to see that citizens see this to be quite normal whereas career politicians have great difficulty reaching consensus on this matter.

In Rome and more than 30 other European cities, including Berlin, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Luxembourg, Madrid, Paris, Vilnius and Warsaw, thousands of people took to the streets. 
For Sigmar Gabriel, this approach points the way forward even today. 
According to the organisers, the pro-European “March for Europe” in Berlin attracted around 4000 people. 
The celebrations also provide us with an opportunity to look back on this grand project and to remind ourselves of what it actually means to be a citizen of the European Union. 
Role model that set standards

“Fighting for a stronger Europe” by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel 
60 good reasons for the EU (published by the European Commission to mark the 60th anniversary) 
The declaration ended with a renewed commitment to the main message of the celebrations: 
It was the Federal Republic of Germany that took a leading role in opposing this in the past. 
The Rome Agenda contained in the Declaration sets out the key issues on which the EU is to focus during the next ten years: 
(1) greater internal security, (2) the promotion of prosperity and sustainability, (3) more social justice and (4) a more decisive and stronger role for the EU on the global scene. 
For many EU citizens, the anniversary was a chance to express their desire for a strong and democratic EU based on the principle of solidarity. 
More than six decades of European unity – a success story 
The common market secures jobs and prosperity 
The official celebrations in Rome last weekend gave the Heads of State and Government of the 27 EU member states and the representatives of the EU institutions an opportunity to renew their commitment to a shared European future. 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher Foyer opens 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel viewed the exhibition together with Barbara Genscher. 
With his far-sighted foreign policy, he paved the way not just for German reunification but also for the overcoming of the division of Europe as a whole. 
Why was Genscher so successful as a champion of reconciliation? 
These were the questions dealt with by the international symposium in the Federal Foreign Office to honour the long-serving foreign minister. 
"Genscher's idea of a tolerant, liberal, free and surely also social Europe is one we can carry into the future" 
"Genscher's idea of a tolerant, liberal, free and surely also social Europe is one we can carry into the future," Gabriel underscored. 
Negotiating pragmatically with difficult partners while being guided by binding values remains one of the most important challenges of foreign policy, as Gabriel pointed out. 
Before the symposium, Foreign Minister Gabriel officially opened the new Hans-Dietrich Genscher Foyer. 
With this name, the diplomats in the Federal Foreign Office will have a constant reminder of a role model who through his actions set standards which also apply to the challenges of today. 
And, at the same time, citizens also have a number of ideas for things that the European Union does, but which we could perhaps do better at the national, regional or municipal level. 
Europe is committed to the security of its citizens and to the territorial integrity of its member states. 
In 2018, Argentina will take over the G20 Presidency from Germany. 
It emanates stability beyond its own borders in many ways – politically, with a proactive security policy and, of course, economically. 
In a nutshell, you could say that 
the European Union, taken by itself, is not yet able to project power. 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher was Germany's chief diplomat from 1974 to 1992. 
What can we learn today from his work to promote an order of peace spanning Europe? 
Diplomats, politicians and journalists discussed what conclusions could be drawn today from Genscher's political legacy. 
For him, at a time when we face new challenges on the European continent, Genscher's policy is a special inspiration. 
However, we actually don’t want to have all that much to do with the world. 
"You recognise a good pilot by a steady hand not the loudest voice,” as one of Hans-Dietrich Genscher's mottoes goes. 
"Hans-Dietrich Genscher's legacy also teaches us perseverance and patience," as Gabriel emphasised. 
"Champion of reconciliation, direction and vision”: 
Higher education 
Official relations between Germany and Argentina have existed since 1857. 
Cooperation in academia, science and research is a priority for both sides. 
On multilateral issues, there is broad consensus on the importance of multilateralism and international law, on nuclear non-proliferation and in particular on human rights. 
Then Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier travelled to Argentina on 2 and 3 June 2016, signing various agreements including one on a working-holiday programme that will enable youths and young adults from both countries to spend a year living and working in the partner country. 
Argentine President Mauricio Macri paid a visit to Berlin from 4 to 6 July 2016, meeting with Federal President Joachim Gauck, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, Bundestag President Norbert Lammert, then Federal Foreign Minister Steinmeier and then Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Gabriel. 
The signing of nine declarations on strengthening German-Argentine cooperation, not least in the economic and scientific sectors, underscores the interest of both sides in further intensifying relations. 
Overall, Argentina is Germany’s third most important trading partner in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. 
In 2015, over five percent of Argentina’s total imports came from Germany, which remains the country’s fourth most important supplier, after Brazil, China and the United States. 
In 2014, Germany fell to 12th place among buyers of Argentine exports, after previously ranking ninth for a number of years. 
Bilateral trade grew again in 2015, by 3.3 percent, after slumping at times by double-digit figures in the two previous years. 
This growth was due solely to the 9 percent increase in German exports, while German imports from Argentina declined by 5.1 percent. 
In 2015, Germany recorded a surplus of 1.135 billion euros in its trade with Argentina. 
Germany’s principal imports from Argentina are raw materials (accounting for 24.3 percent of imports) and food (38.8 percent). Germany is the biggest buyer of Argentine beef in the EU. 
In 2015, German imports of vehicles and vehicle parts from Argentina accounted for 14.4 percent of total German imports from the country. 
In 2014 and 2015, however, the share of vehicles and vehicle parts in Germany’s total exports to Argentina fell from 30-35 percent for the period 2010-2013 to 14 percent as a result of new taxes, especially in the premium segment, and stronger general restrictions on imports of vehicles. 
In 2015, Germany’s principal exports to Argentina were machinery (28.5 percent) and chemical products (24.3 percent). 
The European Union plays a major role in foreign direct investment in Argentina. The principal individual investors are the United States and Brazil. 
Germany ranks third among EU investors there, after Spain and the Netherlands. The principal investments by German companies are concentrated in the automotive, energy and service (finance and insurance) sectors. The Argentine-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (CADICAA) has more than 500 members, including some 150 German companies. There are a total of around 200 companies with German capital operating in Argentina, directly providing over 22,000 jobs. 
The German Schools Abroad in Argentina are among the best-regarded private schools in the country and are also thought highly of by parents with no connection to Germany. 
Of these, four are German Schools Abroad in Greater Buenos Aires (one with a German university entrance – Abitur – stream, three offering the optional mixed-language school-leaving qualification International Baccalaureate and one with an integrated vocational training centre and leading to the optional German university of applied sciences entrance qualification). 
And we prefer to think about how we can make the walls on Europe’s borders a little higher once again than to consider how we can demonstrate with political, economic and, if necessary, military power, that we have a voice in this world. 
German films enjoy a high profile in Argentina, being regularly submitted to the country’s two most important film festivals and drawing a broad and positive response, as well as being screened at the annual week-long Festival of German Films in Buenos Aires, which is held in September. 
Leading German musicians and orchestras regularly visit the country, and the Argentines’ affection for the German rock band Tote Hosen is legendary. 
Stepping up cooperation in university teaching and research is a goal being pursued by both Germany and Argentina in their bilateral relations. 
Bilateral cooperation in science and technology has a long tradition dating back many years (framework agreement of 31 March 1969). 
In addition to the Max Planck Society, numerous major research institutions belonging to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres are active in Argentina. 
In recent years, the German Research Foundation has greatly expanded its cooperation with Argentina. 
The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, which in the past focused its cooperation with Latin America on Brazil and Chile, is now seeking to extend its activities to Argentina and has begun cooperating with the city and province of Buenos Aires as part of its City of the Future initiative. 
In 2015, some 400 German and 680 Argentine students received German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) funding. 
The DAAD is also active in other areas. 
The long-term lectureship at the University of Buenos Aires’ (UBA) School of Law has been filled again since August 2015. 
The Walter Gropius Chair in Architecture and Urban Studies has been established at the private Universidad Torcuato Di Tella. 
Other DAAD lectors are working to improve language teacher and translator training in Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Tucumán. 
We cannot blame the European Union for the fact that this is not yet the case today and that we lack instruments and capabilities for helping to prevent and manage crises and conflicts more comprehensively and effectively and to become a global actor promoting security and stability. 
This can come as no surprise and is not meant as an accusation. 
It has successfully performed this role for decades. 
However, the EU is not yet in a position to play an active and shaping as well as a mediating, mitigating, de-escalating and stabilising role at the global level. 
So what needs to be done? 
"The name Hans-Dietrich Genscher stands for courage and far-sightedness,” Foreign Minister Gabriel declared. 
We must build on this. 
For this, we need a common foreign policy at European level on the basis of which we can develop our security policy instruments. 
We must focus on what it is that characterises us Europeans. 
Our strength lies precisely in the fact that we approach crises with a broad toolbox – with diplomatic, civilian, police and, yes, also with military means. 
Please don’t misunderstand me. 
This is a hallmark of European foreign and security policy that we must preserve and expand. 
However, because this has been an issue on a number of occasions recently, I would like to explain briefly why the tenor of the current discussion surrounding our military spending worries me. 
A mathematician would say that 
At a purely national level? 
Should we as Germans also pursue a two percent target, which, by the way, doesn’t exist in NATO? 
There is no stipulation of an apodictic two percent target. 
This two percent target would mean that Germany would spend nearly 70 billion euros on the Bundeswehr each year. 
Looking to the future, 
I doubt whether this would be in line with the concept of interconnected and common security. 
Boiling the discussion down to defence spending is therefore a mistake in itself. 
especially for us in Europe. 
I think it will be to Germany’s credit for us to take such debates seriously. 
This seriousness is manifested firstly by being honest with others. 
I don’t know of anyone who would put together and approve a federal budget like that. 
And certainly no one who, like my colleague Jens Spahn, believes that cutbacks should be made to welfare spending. 
If it results in cutbacks to the civilian part of security policy among the strongest proponents of this policy, then I sense that we would be heading in the wrong direction were we to simply replicate this. 
And no matter how difficult it is to take a nuanced position in such debates, we should adopt one. 
Namely that we are, firstly, committed to modernising the Bundeswehr and to assuming a greater share of the defence burden, 
These are the key points of the European project and our European efforts to achieve this should also be recognised internationally. 
The primacy of foreign policy and a comprehensive concept of security – this is the framework in which, to my mind, the member states of the European Union must deepen their common foreign policy and also their cooperation in common defence. 
We must be prepared to have the courage to achieve greater European integration in these areas. 
In mid-September 2016, German Vice-Chancellor and then Federal Economic Affairs Minister Sigmar Gabriel attended the international Argentina Investment and Business Forum organised by the Argentine Government in Buenos Aires. He also held political talks with top Argentine officials, including President Mauricio Macri, Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay and Production Minister Francisco Cabrera. 
The DAAD also has a lectureship at UBA’s Faculty of Letters and Philosophy (Walter Benjamin Free Chair). 
Along with Brazil and Mexico, Argentina is one of the three countries representing Latin America in the G20 group of major industrialised countries and emerging economies. 
An important pillar of bilateral cooperation is the German-Argentine Centre for Higher Education (DAHZ), which was set up in 2012 by the German and Argentine Governments and the Argentine-German Scientific Association of German Business in Argentina. 
Co-funded scholarship programmes with Argentina’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation are being expanded, especially in engineering. 
This is why I feel an obligation to strengthen the High Representative in her role. 
A long nine-month wait is now over. 
In the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme, it was a boon that Europe was directly represented by the High Representative at the table and able to negotiate successfully. 
We know what we want, we have a clear and detailed negotiating position, and we can give the European Commission a strong mandate. 
The negotiations will certainly not be easy for both sides. 
However, all this must not be what our future relations will be built on. 
This might sound like a small step. 
The United Kingdom will remain our neighbour, and the EU will remain Britain’s neighbour. 
I firmly believe that we must also find new ways to make our work in the Foreign Affairs Council, where the Foreign Ministers meet, more efficient. 
It is time to put national sensitivities that block our common action as Europeans on the back burner. 
Political self-commitment isn’t something that only applies to the economy, but also to ourselves. 
Why shouldn’t it be possible to say something like this: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (29 March) on the United Kingdom’s letter giving notification of the intention to withdraw from the European Union: 
And I’m delighted that we managed to adopt a joint declaration. 
The EU is likely to receive a letter from the UK on the day after tomorrow, which will begin the process of the country’s exit from the European Union. 
I would advise anyway that we conduct the withdrawal process with self-confidence and without inflicting any harm on the remaining 27 member states. 
We have a division between a relatively prosperous north and a less prosperous south undergoing difficulties. 
It is therefore good that the British side, too, has made clear it desires a strong European Union. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on United Kingdom giving notification of intention to withdraw from the EU 
It is understandable that there may be hard feelings. For many, it may still be hard today to understand how anyone could believe themselves better off standing alone in these uncertain global times. 
Although it may sound like a hollow phrase, particularly when two individuals separate, “Let’s still be friends” is the right thing to say in this situation. 
we face immense challenges here in Europe. 
I think we are all aware that 
The prevailing narrative of years past – “muddling through” or “it’ll work out somehow” – will no longer fit the bill. 
However, we must take care not to lose sight of the fact that Europe isn’t just a collection of a few major countries, 
This is not how Europe was built. 
It is becoming more important as events in the world at large that have such an intense and immediate impact on us are directly linked to European issues of the future. 
Europe is surrounded by countless crises and conflicts that are putting all of us to the test. 
The conflicts in our neighbourhood have not only increased in number, 
Crises triggered by political failure, corruption, hunger and climate change are being added to the mix. 
Crises keep on emerging and, as we have seen, often remain unsolved. 
Terrorist threats are on the increase – as the recent attack in London reminded us once again all too clearly. 
where they think Europe must do more. 
Incidentally, this is not about surrendering sovereignty. 
Europe helps its nation states to enhance their sovereignty and not to forfeit it, as some people claim. 
I therefore believe that Europe should not develop a special form of exceptionalism of a kind that we a familiar with from the US, one which is simply inverted. 
The message preached by the doctrine of American exceptionalism goes like this: 
Europe should take care to ensure that we do not preach the inverse of this, namely: 
“We too know what the best way to coexist is. 
We don’t want to be drawn into conflicts.” 
At the end of the day, the EU lacks the means to safeguard its own security to the extent that would be desirable. 
I want to mention two principles that I believe should guide us, before outlining a number of concrete steps that we should take. 
I emphasise this not in my capacity as Foreign Minister, but because I firmly believe that we must always consider 
the political challenges that we face. 
For this, we need, more so today than in the past, a common European understanding of these problems and challenges as the basis for our common action. 
After all, it is clear that, in a world in which the balance of power is shifting, we will only have a voice if it is a common European voice. 
The basis for this must – this is the second principle that I wish to mention – be a comprehensive concept of security that comprises all available means and instruments. 
I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop our military capabilities in Europe and also advocate strengthening our common defence. 
I will say a bit more about this in just a moment. 
This is why we must indeed do more and also increase our spending. 
It is good that the state of limbo has finally ended, and that negotiations can begin soon. 
We would, at the heart of Europe, with the biggest economy and the country with the largest population, spend gigantic sums of money on the German Bundeswehr each year. 
The European Union’s 27 remaining member states have made good use of the time prior to official notification. 
Michel Barnier and his team at the Commission can count on our full support as they work to make sure our common aims are achieved during the negotiations. 
However, it is also a mistake to consider this issue in national terms – 
I will underscore this fact during my first visit to London as Foreign Minister, right at the beginning of next week. 
The actual way to make a difference is to invest now – in common capabilities and structures where we assume responsibility for each other. 
We should do everything we can so that we continue to have close and amicable relations with London. 
In Germany’s view, an essential guiding principle during the negotiations is that the EU 27 must remain together. We must not only preserve the great achievement of European integration, but also develop it further and prepare it for upcoming challenges. 
You can probably see why I view this two percent debate with a bit of concern. 
I have seen a high level of consensus among the member states in many areas. 
However, it is important in order to trigger changes in mindsets, in European thinking – both among our European partners and our negotiation partners. 
For example, when this has to do with forging ahead with important projects and the whole thing collapses because a single country doesn’t want to join the consensus. 
Can’t we as member states show more willingness to refrain from holding the entire EU back with a single veto? 
“If we are alone in such a vote, we will not hold up the European project with our veto.” 
There are many questions and discussions regarding how the European Union should safeguard its cohesion and the form that its cooperation should take in the future. 
A state of affairs that is untenable in the long term is if it is exclusively our country that is looked to on every issue. 
Europe was built so that we could master challenges as a community. 
At the same time, raw power politics has made a comeback on the international stage. 
And it is precisely for this reason that we need clever analyses and strong common responses – especially in foreign and security policy. 
You don’t need to have studied politics to understand that 27 friends may not all have the same needs. 
The Treaty of Lisbon laid important foundations for this, including the mutual assistance clause set out in Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. 
I’m not the only one who sees things this way. 
Two-thirds of Europeans want there to be more, and not less, European integration in the area of foreign, security and defence policy. 
the primacy of foreign policy must apply especially with regard to security policy issues in Europe. 
I believe that we have to be a bit careful not to revert to the times when we thought increased military spending equated to increased security. 
being able to defend oneself militarily is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for security. 
The predilection in the public debate with talking this up gives me cause for thought. 
I’m not so sure whether our European partners would still actually consider this to be an especially safe bet in twenty years’ time with twelve years of such investment under our belts. 
Incidentally, I know of no one in Europe who, like the US President, would allow an increase in the military budget to go hand in hand with cutbacks in funding for the World Food Programme, development aid and crisis prevention. 
Germany thought of the protection of external borders as a national task. 
Members of local councils and Land parliaments with Turkish roots are examples of successful integration. 
On Wednesday (29 March), they visited the Federal Foreign Office for talks with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière and the Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration, Aydan Özoğuz. 
The meeting focused on how the cohesion of our society can be further strengthened in the face of the current challenges.

Foreign policy and integration 
It was a frank exchange at the interface between foreign policy and integration.

No parallel societies 
Foreign Minister Gabriel stressed at the start of the meeting that Germany would not be as strong as it is today without all the people from other countries, especially Turkey, who helped to rebuild it after the war. 
Host on Congolese broadcaster Radio Okapi, which is operated by the United Nations at the MONUSCO compound in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 19 February 2015 
In the past, talking directly to citizens of Turkish origin had always proven to be the best way to examine integration and relations with Turkey. 
The participation of the Interior Minister, the Commissioner for Integration and the Foreign Minister meant that there were three key representatives of the German Government at the table. 
There was certainly enough to discuss: Foreign Minister Gabriel ended up staying much longer than planned. 
Today’s meeting was a further step along this common road.

Key bridge-builders for our country: meeting with German politicians of Turkish origin 
In the light of the forthcoming referendum on Turkey’s constitution, therefore, the task was to ensure that the decades-long success of Germany’s diverse society continues. 
A week ago, Sigmar Gabriel and Aydan Özoğuz met German business people of Turkish origin. 
Positioning ourselves better as a Union also means improving the coordination of our political, civilian and military instruments. 
Our work in this area extends from Ukraine to the Horn of Africa. 
Civilian experts, diplomats, police officers and soldiers are currently deployed in 15 EU crisis management missions. 
where the EU training mission is training Malian soldiers. 
It is important that our activities complement each other in this regard. 
What we Europeans are doing in Mali is part of an overall strategy and we are liaising closely with the United Nations. 
However, the example of Mali also shows where we must make progress in Europe as regards the coordination of our various instruments. 
And this brings me to the concrete steps to be taken in the area of security and defence policy. 
We have made important progress at the European level in recent times. 
While some of the things in this area may appear to be minor or technical at first sight, they actually have a major impact. 
This will be immensely important in the case of Mali, for example. 
We must continue to do this and pursue the debate on which member states are prepared to follow suit and do more together. 
We are giving greater thought to our common capabilities. 
It is important to organise extra investments in Europe such that they are efficient and result in greater common European strength – 
and not to further imbalances between individual member states. 
I think that we are still a long way from having a “European army” or joint armed forces. 
We rightly have the requirement for parliamentary approval for Bundeswehr missions abroad. 
And the jurisprudence of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Parliamentary Participation Act offer us clear guidelines. 
In a situation in which, for example, the European Union says: 
This must not be contingent upon objections by the German Bundestag because election time is looming or we are locked in difficult debates. 
We can talk about many things with each other, however the basis for this is 
reliability in our capabilities and reliability in our common security policy. 
You will hold talks and discussions today on how we can inject impetus into a Europe that must be better able to hold its own in a world that, unfortunately, does not appear to be getting any more peaceful.

Things will not get any less complex in the future. 
This week, we are going to seek an extension to the mandate for the Bundeswehr’s involvement in the EU mission in Mali, 
At the same time, the EU has deployed a civilian advisory mission in order to strengthen Mali’s security sector. 
This was something that the German Bundestag called for some time ago. 
The Commander of the EU training mission in Mali has had to tackle two difficult tasks simultaneously. 
Firstly, taking responsibility for a challenging mission in the field. 
We are also working on “enhanced structured cooperation”. 
We must increasingly come to understand that our capabilities are “embedded” within the European framework. 
And we must organise these capabilities so that they go hand in hand with what we are doing in NATO. 
However – and we must be honest about this – more integrated capabilities at European level will also mean that there will be a greater focus on the reliability of each and every partner, including Germany. 
“We are taking part in a UN mission” – and certain capabilities can only be made available by member states when Germany provides the necessary back-ups for this. 
However, our real task for the future is to 
continue to work on our common Europe in spite of all of the eurosceptic trends out there. 
And I welcome the fact that German police officers are training their Malian counterparts. 
And, secondly, seeing to the planning and decision-making process in Brussels at the same time. 
And allow me to add one more thing with respect to the letter awaited from London, 
which is that I am really not happy about the Brexit decision. 
We are reminded now of the fact that we mustn’t simply take for granted what our parents and grandparents built up so painstakingly. 
If we manage now to achieve “more Europe” in foreign policy, security and defence, then we will have laid important foundations for the future of this Europe that posterity will thank us for. 
You couldn’t have picked a more eventful week to discuss impetus for the future of Europe if you’d tried. 
And neither should this be done along the lines of “How can we punish the British people for their decision?”, 
rather we must see to it that we remain as close to each other as possible because, at the end of the day, as the British people will also come to realise, we need each other. 
The European Union has not kept its promise of prosperity, however. 
Irrespective of our take on how this problem ought to be tackled, we will, at any rate, need to be mindful to ensure that this social division in Europe does not run so deep that it jeopardises projects such as common foreign and security policy as we drift ever further apart from each other. 
And, of course, this means that we must try, for instance in the area of security and defence policy, to identify new fields where greater cooperation is desired on the part of these countries and where integration is being driven forward by them while other fields might elude us in this regard. 
but that we are many small countries that are on an equal footing in Europe. 
this isn’t just about Germany, which sticks out because it is strong economically. 
We must constantly remind our partners in Washington, Moscow and Beijing that 
We Germans must sometimes take care to show smaller member states that we do know we are all equals here. 
Sometimes it would be more desirable if our dealings with the many other nations in Europe, to whom we must not come across as presuming to take the leading politically, economically and, ultimately, militarily, were a little more informed by the Bonn Republic and a little less by the Berlin Republic. 
We are witnessing trends towards greater armament in many countries of the world. 
And we too are embroiled in a debate on how we must come to grips with this. 
To my mind – and this isn’t terribly surprising coming from a Foreign Minister – security and defence policy is a function of politics and foreign policy. 
It is not an accoutrement of foreign policy, but is obviously a function of politics in general. 
And it would perhaps be fairly wise to think together about which skills we share and what we intend to achieve with them. 
Another reason for doing this is to be efficient and avoid wasting vast amounts of money in the wrong areas. 
I think this is something that citizens in Europe consider to be entirely normal – 
just as they consider it to be normal that the protection of the European Union’s external borders is ensured at community level. 
It is only now that awareness is growing that this is also part of a common security policy. 
At any rate, I think it is a very good sign that when people are asked what the European Union should do, they quite naturally cite foreign, security and defence policy as one of the major tasks that we can only master together. 
Not “more Europe in all things”, but rather a different, a better Europe that concentrates on what works well at the supranational level and what we can no longer manage by ourselves. 
Europe and the European Union are there to ensure that where the member states no longer enjoy sovereignty in the world of tomorrow, we can regain this sovereignty as a community. 
Granted, the European Union has also evolved in the area of foreign and security policy in recent years. 
The European Union has become, to an extent, a stabilising power, especially in its direct neighbourhood, but also beyond. 
However, ladies and gentlemen, 
the truth is that Europe’s abilities to project security and stability beyond its own borders are most certainly not yet sufficiently well developed. 
In view of developments in the world, where military power has gained in prominence as a factor of international policy once again, you cannot ignore this fact, even if we wish the world were different. 
“We have the best model for coexistence and we are bringing this to the world.” 
That we are prepared to defend ourselves and also to help others. 
And yet Europe as a credible actor in the world would be more important today than ever before. 
But not exclusively. 
I simply believe that we are too preoccupied with the matter of military spending in the public debate, and also within NATO. 
What is decisive, however, is how we go about this. 
And for which the Federal Republic of Germany must make do its own part. 
However, we do not intend to pursue such gigantic and, in the final instance, false demands such as the two percent target. 
That, instead, we aim to maintain an enhanced security concept in which we also live up to our responsibility. 
The core of the matter is, after all, that the EU brings about security for Europe together and works together to promote peace and stability in the world – without countries going it alone any more. 
This isn’t true across the board though, and our cooperation within the EU is also not yet efficient enough. 
The fact that the European External Action Service is organising the next conference on Syria in the coming week is a vital signal for European engagement for this reason too. 
However, together with our European partners, we should also consider, in other fields, how we can ensure that the High Representative is able to attend decisive talks and negotiations. 
We don’t need an amended treaty for this, but the political will of each and every member state. 
The High Representative Federica Mogherini took an important step forward in this regard last year with the Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union. 
This would help us to take European foreign policy a major step forward. 
In general, I think that we are taking the right approach in supporting police missions around the world more strongly than in the past with our Federal Police – be it with the EU in Mali, within the OSCE or in the United Nations. 
Juggling two tasks makes little sense. 
A few weeks ago, we agreed to the establishment of the “Military Planning and Conduct Capability” for military training missions in Brussels – this was an important step. 
This somewhat cumbersome name denotes a European command centre where all efforts are coordinated – an institution that Europe still doesn’t dare call by its actual name. 
Moreover, there will be a civil-military coordination cell where civilian and military aspects can now, finally, be better dovetailed with each other. 
An important step in this direction could be a European defence fund equipped with the financial resources to develop and procure military capabilities jointly. 
thinking more in European terms as well as coordinating capabilities and developing and procuring them in concert – this must be the objective that we commit ourselves to with all our might. 
However, this will also mean – and we must be realistic when we call for and aspire to this – that we in Germany must think about how we can be best prepared for this. 
We must be aware that politics will be facing challenges in our country. 
Our partners must be able to expect this from us and we must meet their expectations. 
However, if it means that we in Europe close ranks and we manage, especially in foreign and security policy, to keep our British friends by our side, then we shouldn’t have any cause to fear this letter or its consequences. 
Common values in Europe are guiding us in these endeavours – freedom, democracy and human rights – and a European shared responsibility for our security, and also for global peace and stability. 
EU Mission in Mali: 
Establishing security through training 
The European Union believes that good training for the country’s security forces is necessary for lasting peace and stability in Mali. 
Germany has been participating in EUTM Mali (EU Training Mission in Mali) for four years now. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel today told the German Bundestag why the mission is particularly important for Germany. 
A Malian soldier discussing a manoeuvre strategy with a German instructor during a training exercise 
The extremists’ advance on the capital, Bamako, was stopped only through resolute action by France. 
The Malian Government had requested such support. 
Terrorism and the smouldering conflict between various ethnic groups had long robbed the state of control of large swathes of the country. 
Helping people help themselves 
Since then, the help given by the international community has brought many improvements: 
the Government and separatist rebel groups signed a peace agreement in June 2015. 
The gradual improvement in the security and humanitarian situation is due in part to the EU Mission in which Germany is participating: 
A total of 140 Bundeswehr soldiers are currently working in Mali. 
where the motion to extend the mandate for Bundeswehr participation today had its first reading. 
The application was passed to the lead Committee on Foreign Affairs for consultation. 
Human rights on the curriculum 
The curriculum includes not only classical military training, but also international humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict) and human rights. 
So that the training has a long-term impact, the Mission is increasingly concentrating on “training the trainers”. 
Stabilisation and prevention: major interests in the Sahel region 
“Mali’s stabilisation is crucial for security and development in the entire region,” Gabriel said. 
Mali is a transit country for many refugees. 
Development, stability and security, by contrast, give the population a brighter outlook if they stay. 
Gabriel receives Swiss Foreign Minister Burkhalter 
That is why Germany, as well as supporting EUTM Mali and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), is also engaged at various levels to ensure stability and prevent the outbreak of new crises in the country. 
Enjoying excellent relations: 
Gabriel and his counterpart Burkhalter © Federal Foreign Office 
Switzerland is marking an anniversary this year. The first Swiss mission abroad was opened in Berlin back in 1867, the Swiss mission to the North German Confederation. 
One hundred and fifty years have passed since then. Relations between Germany and Switzerland were closer than ever before, said Foreign Minister Gabriel following talks with his counterpart. 
Ties between Switzerland and Germany are close both politically and culturally. 
Swiss companies have created jobs for some 400,000 people in Germany, which is Switzerland’s most important trading partner. 
The two countries also enjoy close cultural links. 
cooperation in the OSCE 
Gabriel emphasised that both countries shared a number of values, 
Joint commitment to peace and security: 
Relations between Germany and Switzerland are close. Berlin has been home to Swiss diplomatic missions for 150 years. 
150 years of Swiss diplomatic missions 
The long-standing dialogue between the countries testified to their excellent bilateral relations, said the German Foreign Minister. 
While works by Friedrich Dürrenmatt and Max Frisch are read in Germany, Günter Grass and Thomas Mann are on the school curriculum in Switzerland. 
A joint commitment to peace and stability is a political priority for both countries. 
such as democracy and justice, peace and openness, and a certain “humanitarian reflex”. 
Talks between Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Swiss counterpart Didier Burkhalter on Thursday (30 March) focused on bilateral relations, the situation in eastern Ukraine and hunger crises in Africa. 
Gabriel and Burkhalter at a joint press conference © Federal Foreign Office 
Only limited progress continues to be made with respect to the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the agreements reached at the Munich Security Conference. 
Long-term stabilisation in Africa 
The hunger crises affecting many countries in the Horn of Africa were also on the agenda. 
The Ministers said that a meeting to discuss further assistance for the affected regions would be taking place on the fringes of the EU Foreign Affairs Council next week. 
They said that it was Germany and Switzerland’s common aim to create stable structures in the long term also in this area. 
In this context, the Federal Foreign Office consults with and assists the Malian Ministry of Reconciliation, among others, and supports projects which improve the population’s living conditions. 
Both sides have now agreed on an Easter ceasefire that is to begin on 1 April. 
The situation in eastern Ukraine was therefore an important topic during their talks and is an issue on which Germany and Switzerland are cooperating particularly within the framework of the OSCE. 
Five years ago, Islamist militias brought brutal violence and destruction to Mali. 
The EU Training Mission in Mali has been supporting the Malian army since 2013. 
EUTM Mali is intended to enable the Malian armed forces to ensure their country’s security again themselves in future. 
“Our engagement in Mali shows that, wherever Europe is willing to enter into a shared commitment, we achieve something worthwhile,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said in the Bundestag, 
Since 2013, EUTM Mali has trained more than 9000 Malian soldiers. 
Stability in Mali and the Sahel region is a major interest for Germany and Europe.

We Europeans cannot accept this. 
The United States Department of Commerce chose to use different calculation methods. 
The affected companies may now take their case to court. 
Development cooperation and economic relations 
The Federal Republic of Germany and Burkina Faso have maintained diplomatic relations since 1960. 
Numerous town twinning arrangements and association partnerships as well as the activities of non-governmental organisations have helped to consolidate these relations, resulting in a tight-knit web of personal and institutional contacts. 
Bilateral relations focus on development cooperation in the following areas: agriculture and food security, water supply and sanitation, and decentralisation. 
From the beginning of cooperation in 1961 up to the end of 2015, German development cooperation commitments have totalled nearly one billion euros. 
A bilateral investment protection agreement has been in place since October 2009. 
Bilateral cultural relations focus on promoting the German language. 
Two of the country’s grammar schools participate in the Federal Foreign Office’s Schools: Partners for the Future initiative (PASCH). 
There are numerous cooperation projects in higher education.

Foreign Minister Gabriel baffled by anti‑dumping investigation against German steel companies 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (31 March) on the United States anti‑dumping investigation against German steel companies: 
I very much fail to comprehend the decision taken by the United States Department of Commerce in connection with its anti‑dumping investigation concerning Salzgitter AG and Dillinger Hütte. 
Despite all of our efforts and repeated interventions by the European Union, the United States Department of Commerce has used calculation methods that run counter to WTO agreements, for the purpose of harming the US’s competitors in the steel sector. 
The intention is to protect the US steel industry by creating disadvantages for the stronger German steel industry. 
This decision is all the more significant because it is the first anti‑dumping investigation in the steel sector conducted by the new US administration. 
The US Government is apparently prepared to provide American companies with unfair competitive advantages over European and other producers, even if such action violates international trade law. 
WTO rules are the backbone of the international trade system. 
Knowingly breaching them is a dangerous step. 
It is the first time the US is, in the context of such an investigation, resorting to methods that distort competition and are not in line with WTO rules. 
The EU must now consider whether it, too, will lodge a complaint with the WTO. 
I strongly support this. 
We must take a decisive stance vis‑à‑vis the United States, in defence of fair competition and against creative accounting practices that disadvantage our German steel industry, which is hard‑working and produces exceptionally high quality products, making it very competitive on the international market. 
If the US effort to force through unfair competition were to succeed, the same development may also occur in other industrial sectors. 
On 30 March, the United States Department of Commerce concluded its anti dumping investigation, finding producers in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy and Germany (Salzgitter AG in Lower Saxony and Dillinger Hütte in Saarland) to have dumped steel plate and thereby also setting final duty rates for these exporters. 
Both Germany and European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström had intervened prior to this decision, demanding that established WTO rules and standards be adhered to. 
In addition, the German-supported Ciné Bus project is providing access to high-quality regional film productions, even in remote areas of the countries. 
On Thursday (30 March), an additional protocol to the cultural agreement between Germany and Egypt dating from 1959 was signed at the Federal Federal Foreign Office. 
For the new agreement to enter into force, it must first be ratified by the Egyptian parliament. 
They will receive a special status. 
The amended agreement provides a new basis in international law and determines the official status of, and working conditions for, the German political foundations in Egypt. 
Egyptian Ambassador to Germany Badr Abdelatty and Philipp Ackermann, Regional Director for the Near and Middle East and the Maghreb, signed the additional protocol at the Federal Foreign Office. 
It will then provide the legal framework for the activities of German political foundations in Egypt.

Foreign Minister Gabriel on support for the peace agreement in Colombia 
Today (30 March) Foreign Minister Gabriel commented as follows on the signing of a cooperation agreement on practical support for the UN Mission in Colombia provided by the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW): 
The United Nations and Germany have launched a unique form of cooperation, under which THW experts are doing their bit to help stabilise Colombia and in particular to support the recently commenced disarmament of former combatants. 
The conflict lasted for more than 50 years and claimed more than 200,000 lives. It is thus now of vital importance that the peace agreement between the Government and the FARC guerillas be implemented rigorously and rapidly. 
The United Nations is playing a key role in this process with its Mission in Colombia. It can rest assured of Germany’s support. 
Strengthening the United Nations is one of Germany’s key foreign policy priorities. 
At the request of the United Nations, a group of experts from the THW is working in Colombia, with Federal Foreign Office support, to put in place essential information and communications technology for the UN Mission. 
This THW mission is the first ever mission by a civilian organisation of its kind under UN auspices. 
The UN Mission in Colombia was charged by the UN Security Council, in resolution 2261 of 25 January 2016, with monitoring and verifying the ceasefire between the Colombian Government and the FARC rebels and supporting the peace process between the parties. 
On Friday (31 March), the Foreign Ministers of the NATO member states met in Brussels to discuss current NATO missions, Ukraine and Russia. 
On Friday (31 March), Sigmar Gabriel took part in the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Brussels. 
The agenda included not only current missions and burden-sharing but also the situation in Ukraine and in the Western Balkans as well as relations with Russia.

Federal Foreign Office on the establishment of a new settlement in the West Bank 
The Federal Government is committed to a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Efforts had to be continued to find ways to improve relations with Russia once more. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (31 March) on the decision by the Israeli Cabinet to build a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time since 1991: 
This decision puts to the test our trust in the willingness of the Israeli Government to achieve a negotiated peace, for which there is no credible or viable alternative other than a two-state solution. 
Our friendship with Israel is unwavering. 
Germany is and always will be committed to Israel’s security. 
The Federal Government expects clarity on the part of the Israeli Government with respect to the solution that it is pursuing in order to achieve a lasting peace with the Palestinians. 
There was concern that old resentments would surface there again and lead to new conflicts, said Gabriel. 
NATO’s role in the Mediterranean and the conflict in Syria were also addressed. 
During the night of 30 to 31 March, the Israeli Cabinet authorised the construction of a new settlement for the first time since the establishment of Har Homa in 1991.

Gabriel: We need a broader definition of security 
Gabriel talking to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg © Trutschel/photothek.net 
The Foreign Minister said that not only military spending should be included in a country’s NATO expenditure. 
Rather, contributions to peace, stability and security should play a bigger role. 
He added that conflicts such as those in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq had shown that problems cannot be resolved by military means alone. 
The resumption of settlement construction violates international law and makes a solution to the conflict increasingly difficult – particularly now that, for the first time in many years, a decision to build a new settlement has been reached. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on NATO 
The Geulat Zion settlement to be constructed is intended to house residents from the – also to the mind of the Israelis – illegal outpost Amona, the clearance of which has been ordered by the Supreme Court. 
Preparing for the summit: NATO Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels 
Moreover, the Cabinet adopted the publication of calls for tender for 2000 housing units in other settlements in the West Bank and the redesignation of areas as “public land”, thereby paving the way for the subsequent legalisation of the Palgei Mayim, Givat Haroeh and Adei Ad outposts. 
The meeting also served to prepare the NATO Summit due to take place in May. 
Unilateral steps undermine the mediation efforts currently under way to resume negotiations. 
This is why we have been following recent developments with profound and growing concern. 
With just under two months to go, the NATO Foreign Ministers met in Brussels to make key decisions for the NATO Summit in May. 
One important issue discussed was relations with Russia. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the floods in Colombia 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel today (2 April) issued the following statement on the floods in Mocoa, Colombia: 
The annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine have set back NATO’s relations with Russia, which had been developing well before these crises, Gabriel stated. 
He went on to say that he was glad that the NATO-Russia Council had convened just one day before the Foreign Ministers meeting. 
Rex Tillerson, the new US Secretary of State, took part in a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers for the first time. 
They have also helped German tourists in the region. 
“Security can only be achieved through social, economic and political stability”, emphasised Gabriel. 
He went on to say that Germany was already making major contributions in these areas, also in the humanitarian assistance sphere and in the efforts to manage the refugee flows. 
New agreement signed on activities of German political foundations in Egypt 
This is an important step towards resolving the case of two staff members of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung who were convicted in absentia and handed down prison sentences in 2013. 
Ambassador Badr Abdelatty and Philipp Ackermann, Regional Director for the Near and Middle East and the Maghreb 
Agreement on the additional protocol was reached following intensive bilateral negotiations that also involved all German political foundations. 
Concerning the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung staff members who were convicted in absentia four years ago, the additional protocol is a first step towards finding a solution. The new agreement is therefore also very significant for many German political foundations, because it means they can now prepare to resume their work in Egypt. 
For that they deserve our express thanks and appreciation. 
The Federal Government is ready to provide assistance for the victims of this disaster and to stand firmly by Colombia’s side in this difficult situation. 
We have already contacted aid organisations to find out exactly how we can help. 
Press reports put the number of victims at around 200.

Sport breaks down barriers 
As many people are still missing, the death toll must be expected to rise. 
I was deeply shocked to hear of the devastation caused by a mudslide in the town of Mocoa in southern Colombia. 
At this time my thoughts and those of many of my fellow Germans are with the many victims of this disaster, the families of the more than 200 dead, the many injured, and those who have lost their homes. 
I am particularly grieved that many children are still among the missing and that we must therefore fear the worst for them. 
The Colombian Government and rescue services are making huge efforts on the ground to help the people and to find the victims. 
Persistent rainfall has caused a cascade of mud and debris in the town of Mocoa (population 65,000) in the Putumayo province in southern Colombia. The mudslide has destroyed many houses in the town and buried many of the inhabitants. 
A team of experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), supported by the Federal Foreign Office, is currently working in Colombia to develop information and communications technology as part of the UN Mission to disarm the FARC rebels.

In the East African country, long-distance running is a hugely popular sport on a par with football in Europe. 
To celebrate with people in Ethiopia the power of sport to break down barriers, the German Embassy in Addis Ababa organised a large-scale run through the streets of the capital on the 25th anniversary of German reunification. 
More than 3000 pupils in Addis Ababa gathered at the starting line for a four-kilometre race on 3 October.

As one of the FOC’s Friends of the Chair, Germany is particularly active in the coalition. 
The Freedom Online Coalition is an informal coalition of 30 member countries spread across five continents. 
Its goal is to promote freedom and human rights in the digital age, above all freedom of opinion, privacy, freedom of assembly and freedom of information. 
The coalition’s members coordinate their positions before any major internet events and international negotiations on human rights. 
They also regularly make public statements on current affairs. 
It is particularly important to the FOC to involve civil society,

On the sidelines of the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers on Friday, I again asked my Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Cavusoglu that we be given consular access to Deniz Yücel in accordance with the assurances given to the Chancellor by Prime Minister Binali Yilderim.

Foreign Minister Gabriel deeply shocked by terrible news from St Petersburg 
There is absolutely no justification for this criminal act. 
Our thoughts are with our friends in Russia, the victims and their families at this difficult time. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel made the following comments today (3 April) on the sidelines of Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg concerning the explosion in the St Petersburg metro: 
We do not yet know what happened exactly, nor do we have any information about the background. 
However, there are many indications at the moment that this was a malicious attack on innocent people who were simply going about their daily lives. 
Relations between Germany and Mali are close and wide-ranging. 
Malians like to recall the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to recognise the independent Republic of Mali after the short-lived federation with Senegal was dissolved in September 1960. 
Germany supports the UN MINUSMA mission, the EU training mission EUTM and the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel in Mali. 
Federal Development Minister Müller visited the country in March 2014 and Federal Defence Minister von der Leyen paid visits in February 2014, July 2015 as well as April and December 2016. 
Former Federal President Köhler represented Germany at Malian President Keita’s inauguration ceremony in September 2013. 
President Keita paid an official visit to Berlin in December 2013 and Malian Foreign Affairs Minister Diop was in the German capital in October 2015. 
Federal President Gauck visited Mali in February 2016, while Foreign Minister Steinmeier was there in May 2016 and Chancellor Merkel in October 2016. 
Bilateral trade is relatively insignificant. 
I am deeply shocked by the terrible news coming in from St Petersburg. 
Focus on Syria:

The situation in Yemen was also on the agenda in Luxembourg. 
Visit to Greece 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Elke Büdenbender will be paying their first official visit to the Hellenic Republic from 7 to 8 April. 
In Athens the Federal President will meet President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for political talks and open documenta 14 together with his Greek counterpart. 
On the first day of his visit, the Federal President will meet President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for political talks in Athens. 
On the second day of his Athens trip, Federal President Steinmeier will open documenta 14 together with his Greek counterpart. 
In addition, the Federal President will speak with students and young entrepreneurs from Greece. 
In 2016, Germany imported from Mali goods worth 4.6 million euros and exported to there goods worth 134.9 million euros, mainly textiles and garments, motor vehicles and vehicle parts, machinery and chemical products (according to the Federal Statistical Office). 
An investment protection agreement has been in place since 28 June 1977, but there are no major German investments in Mali. 
Mali is an ACP state and a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union. 
German-Malian development cooperation focuses on three areas: decentralisation, agriculture and water/sanitation. 
The commitments for bilateral development cooperation in Mali have totalled more than 241 million euros since 2013. 
In addition, commitments amounting to 14.6 million euros have been put to use by agencies engaged in non-governmental development cooperation. 
Germany is thus the fourth largest donor in Mali. 
Cultural exchange between Germany and Mali is lively. 
Syria was also the overriding topic of discussion at the meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers on Monday. 
Creating stable conditions 
“It goes without saying that we are supporting the UN process in Geneva”, said Gabriel prior to the talks. 
The conflict could only be resolved by political means, the Foreign Minister continued, 
The principal focus of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg was on Syria. Yemen was likewise on the agenda. 
Two days before the international conference on Syria held in Brussels, the situation in Syria was the focus of the talks. 
Humanitarian assistance in the region would need to be further expanded to this end, he added. 
There are nearly 1000 Malians students majoring in German. 
Turkey: access to Deniz Yücel from Tuesday 
Most German-speaking Malians of the older generation studied in the GDR. 
The original house of the Africa explorer Heinrich Barth in Timbuktu, which contains a small museum, was fully restored with German funding. 
He had contacted his Turkish counterpart Çavuşoğlu once again last week to request that Germany be granted consular access to Yücel as promised, said Gabriel. 
Some 17 million people are in need of outside assistance, while over two million children are suffering from malnutrition. 
The first donors’ conference took place in London in 2016 and has helped to improve the living conditions of many thousands of people in the region. 
Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller visited Burkina Faso at the same time. 
Intergovernmental consultations between Burkina Faso and Germany will take place in summer 2017 in order to determine the programme for the coming years. 
After a hiatus of four and half years, diplomatic visits were resumed in January 2017 with the visit by President of the National Assembly Salifou Diallo and his delegation to German Bundestag President Lammert in Berlin. 
At the end of March, President Kaboré travelled on an official visit to Berlin and met Federal Chancellor Merkel and others. 
which was why Germany remained committed to the negotiation process in spite of all of the difficulties. 
Creating stable conditions for the population in Syria was just as important as the efforts to fight terrorism, said the Minister. 
The objective in Brussels in two days’ time is to build on this success. Further humanitarian support must be secured for Syria and the region, especially Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, and also Iraq and Egypt. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel at the EU Foreign Affairs Council 
Gabriel also gave a statement on the latest developments in the Deniz Yücel case on the sidelines of the talks. 
Syria is once again the focus of international politics this week. A major international donors’ conference for the country and region is taking place in the Belgian capital on Wednesday, which is intended to mobilise fresh funding. 
Two aspects played a particularly important role in this regard: getting humanitarian assistance to the people and pursuing political negotiations to resolve the conflict. These negotiations were resumed in Geneva at the end of March. 
It was important here, he added, not to allow the fight against terrorism and so‑called Islamic State to overshadow the other aspects of the negotiations. 
“Negotiations in Geneva will also be about elections and a new constitution, as well as about a new and democratic government”, said Gabriel. 
The EU Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg: 
With a view to humanitarian assistance, the Foreign Ministers condemned the ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Syria, particularly by the Syrian regime. 
In a common EU strategy, they advocated ending the conflict by facilitating a lasting political solution. 
A political solution to the conflict has yet to be found and the living conditions of the population are worsening. 
The Foreign Ministers said that, in order to de‑escalate the crisis, the first priority was to improve humanitarian access to the population.

On the fringes of the talks, Gabriel gave a statement on the latest developments in the case of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yücel, who is being held on remand in Turkey. 
“This morning Turkey officially confirmed per Note Verbale that we will finally be granted access to Deniz Yücel tomorrow so that we can satisfy ourselves of his well‑being after a difficult time in custody.” 
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and Investment and Technology Promotion Office Germany (ITPO Germany) 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on International Mine Awareness Day 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement to mark International Mine Awareness Day (4 April): 
Landmines, cluster munitions and booby-traps still present a daily and especially perfidious danger in many countries: they can affect anyone, in particular however children out playing, young people or individuals tending their fields or gardens. 
UN SDG Action Campaign 
There can be no justification for the use of these murderous weapons. 
Many states have now banned anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions – a real success story! 
Nevertheless, we cannot afford to slacken our efforts. 
We owe this to the victims and their families. 
That is why Germany is actively working for the global prohibition of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions, and supports projects around the world in the field of humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance.

Burkina Faso is a beneficiary of the special initiative One World – No Hunger (SEWOH). 
The countries prioritised include Colombia, Myanmar, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. 
The Abidjan branch of the Goethe-Institut has run a liaison office in Ouagadougou since September 2008. 
In 2016, the German Government provided around 33 million euros for projects and is thus one of the most important donors. 
A European Film Week is to take place in Ouagadougou in May 2017 during which the film Hannah Arendt will be screened as a German contribution. 
World Food Programme Innovation Accelerator 
There are several town twinning arrangements between the two sides. 
The Goethe Institute responsible for Mali is located in Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire). 
The United Nations World Food Programme established its Innovation Accelerator in 2015 to speed up the development of innovative approaches for a world without hunger. 
A German-Malian Cultural Circle (CCGM) was founded in Mali in 2005 by former GDR scholarship holders. Since the spring of 2008, it has held regular events and offered German courses with the support of the German Embassy. 
As part of its Cultural Preservation Programme, Germany is committed to helping preserve the Arabic manuscripts from the libraries of Timbuktu, which came under threat from Islamist rebels in 2012. 
The Accelerator is an instrument employed in the startup sector and aims to identify and promote new creative tools, with a view to more effectively helping in humanitarian crisis situations and reaching the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. 
The restoration, archiving and digitisation work is ongoing. 
The modern art festival is taking place for the first time this year in Athens in addition to Kassel and is entitled “Learning from Athens”. 
Alongside the actual clearance and disposal of ordnance, the aid measures focus on victim care and efforts to raise public awareness among the population groups affected. 
Germany is a very interesting partner for developing countries thanks to, for example, its sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies.

The Action Campaign for the Sustainable Development Goals has been designed for the purpose of inspiring people to take action with a view to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. It links up the efforts of everyone involved, creates synergies, compiles citizen-generated data, communicates progress to the general public, and promotes the exchange of best practices, as well as the development and testing of innovative ideas. 
The office will bring together potential German investors from the private sector and representatives from developing countries (e.g. business associations, delegations and government representatives) for networking and joint ventures. 
Tackling IS booby-traps with German assistance 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on consular visit to detained Deniz Yücel 
If a family that has fled from IS returns to their home after liberation, they have to reckon with the possibility that even pulling open a drawer could trigger an explosion. 
Outside, the situation is no better: 
what may appear to be merely an empty water canister in the courtyard that someone has thoughtlessly left lying around, could in fact be a booby-trap. 
Deniz Yücel’s life in detention is not easy. 
Old barrels, a kettle, upturned bowls, a discarded exhaust pipe – all of these initially have to be regarded as suspicious and dangerous. 
…Klassenzimmer… 
During a visit to London, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (4 April): 
“I was relieved to learn just now that the nearly two-hour visit of our Consul General with Deniz Yücel went smoothly. 
Any classroom can be a trap – a school in Ramadi secured by explosives experts. 
Janus 
We assured him of this again today. 
German cultural work there focuses on promoting the German language, the further training of Malian students by providing university and professional education grants – approximately 660 since 1974 through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and InWent – Capacity Building International, Germany (integrated into the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ since 2011). 
Experiences in the western Iraqi cities of Fallujah and above all Ramadi, out of which IS was driven last year, have shown that the scale of the booby-traps and mines left by IS is quite unprecedented. 
German Bundestag President Lammert visited Mali in December 2011 and Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle was there in November 2012. Federal Economic Cooperation and Development Minister Niebel and Federal Defence Minister de Maizière travelled to Mali in March 2013. 
Consequently, not only more than 100 civilians, but also an unusually high number of experts have been killed before and during clearance. 
A similar scenario is expected to unfold in the western part of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. 
In 2017, UNIDO will open an Investment and Technology Promotion Office Germany (ITPO Germany) in the UN city of Bonn. The project is receiving financial support from the Federal Government. 
UNIDO currently operates 8 of these ITPOs, in industrialised as well as developing countries.

Clearance of explosives as the basis for stabilisation 
Erfahrungen aus Falludscha…. 
Experiences from Fallujah and Ramadi: 
the scale of the booby-traps left by IS is huge. 
(Click here to see full picture) FFO 
Clearing the booby-traps is more than a mere act of humanity. 
It forms the basis for stabilisation and for a political process designed to lead to peace. 
For this reason, stabilisation, unlike development cooperation, does not pursue any sustainable development goals, but aims for a rapid peace dividend. 
In the case of Mosul, a rapid peace dividend means that first and foremost the city’s essential infrastructure – hospitals, water and electricity supply, schools, administration – needs to be cleared of booby-traps as soon as possible so that it can operate once again. 
“The-Day-After-People”: 
experts are needed 
Improvisierte Sprengsätze… 
Moreover, they generally only start work once peace has been restored to the affected area and they no longer have to cooperate with military players. 
That is not the case directly after liberation from IS. 
So it is all the more important that Deniz Yücel knows we will continue to do everything in our power to obtain his release. 
I am grateful to my Turkish counterpart for being part of the effort that made this visit possible, and that we finally, after waiting several weeks, have obtained access to Deniz Yücel, so that we can talk to him in person. 
Until that happens, we will remain engaged in talks with Turkey, initially making sure that he can receive regular consular visits". 
“Our team includes highly experienced experts who have worked all over the world,” explains the head of the bomb disposal team of Janus Global Operations, a US company that has already worked in Ramadi and Fallujah and is now active in Mosul. 
“Each one of them says that the situation in Iraq is the most complex they have ever seen.” 
“There were evidently ready-built IEDs in large quantities that just had to be attached somewhere,” maintains David Johnson, Vice-President for Strategic Development at Janus. 
“The strategy is to make it hard for people to return and to destabilise the situation even after the defeat of IS.” 
Clearance of explosives makes it possible to return 
Fear of booby-traps is hindering reconstruction. 
It is a race against time. 
The longer it takes, the greater the danger that civilians who may just want to quickly check if their home is still standing incur devastating injuries. 
The success of stabilisation efforts can also be measured by the number of people who return in the wake of a crisis. 
Every house and every courtyard is fought over. 
When the Iraqi forces have succeeded in reconquering western Mosul with the help of their allies, it will initially not be possible either for families to return or for international assistance to be provided and the situation stabilised. 
To stabilise the situation, it is therefore crucial that the clearance process progresses rapidly. 
The clearance of improvised explosive devices in Mosul and other areas liberated from IS is making rapid stabilisation possible with German assistance. 
The improvised explosive devices left behind by “Islamic State” (IS) may be hidden anywhere: in the fridge, under a pile of clothes, on a light switch, under a doorstep or in a toy. 
Many devices were often placed close together so that when someone was injured and people rushed to help them, further traps were triggered. 
IS has entrenched itself there – it is the terror militia’s last stronghold in Iraq. 
Before this can take place, the affected districts must be left to the bomb disposal experts – a task for which the Federal Foreign Office provided around 15 million euros in 2016 and for which this year it has earmarked 7 million euros for Iraq alone. 
“From day one the population needs to feel that driving out IS was worth it,” says Rüdiger König, Head of the Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance at the Federal Foreign Office, which is financing the clearance of the devices. 
“We thereby want to attain a political goal: the strengthening of the Iraqi Government.” 
Aid organisations need to be sure that they can reach those in need without danger and provide them with humanitarian assistance. 
Improvised explosive devices found in Ramadi/Iraq. 
The problem with the current clearance process: the number of experts required for this vast amount of explosives is larger than what the traditional providers, the humanitarian mine clearance organisations, can provide. 
The Federal Foreign Office, together with other donor countries and the UN, therefore supports private-sector providers who, under difficult circumstances, clear the so‑called improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and train local workers. 
As they are the first on the scene of the liberated areas after the soldiers, they like to call themselves “The-Day-After-People”. 
The distribution of the devices gives the impression that it was not the work of individual IS fighters, but that the instructions came from the top. 
The IEDs were used not only for military but also for political purposes. 
And if the devices are not cleared, there can be no guarantee that the residents of the liberated city will feel safe and want to live there again. 
The revised law poses a direct threat to the continued existence of the renowned Central European University (CEU) founded 26 years ago. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in London 
On Tuesday (4 April), Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to London for the first time since assuming office and held talks with Boris Johnson and David Davis. 
On Tuesday (4 April), Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to London for the first time since assuming office, where he met his opposite number Boris Johnson and Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis. 
As well as Brexit, the talks with Boris Johnson also focused on Syria: 
Germany and the United Kingdom want to continue to cooperate closely in future to find a solution to the conflict. 
Brexit: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his British colleague Boris Johnson Grabowsky/photothek.net 
Just a few days after London officially declared its intention to leave the EU, Foreign Minister Gabriel set off on his first visit to the United Kingdom since assuming office. 
Although Brexit is the dominant theme in relations between the United Kingdom and the EU, its consequences were not the main focus of his trip. 
Many professors from Germany work there. Extensive funding from the European Union and the many successful graduates show that this university is an extremely important pillar in Budapest’s academic landscape. 
It helps train highly qualified young people with an international outlook from many different countries. 
Should reports be confirmed that people in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun were victims of a poison gas attack for which the Syrian regime is responsible, this would be an act that plumbs the depths of cruelty. 
It would be yet another reason why we must not count on the Assad regime to help in the fight against terrorism. 
We trust that the United Nations Security Council will take a clear stance should this suspicion be confirmed. 
Anyone who is responsible for such acts must know that, sooner or later, he will be brought to justice. 
The latest legislation can be seen within the context of other restrictions on the work of NGOs and civil society in Hungary. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel stressed after talks with his opposite number Boris Johnson that negotiations on future bilateral relations could only begin when the conditions for withdrawal had been more or less clarified. 
This is one of the reasons why Germany is assisting UN efforts to collect evidence of the most serious violations of human rights in Syria. 
What is already clear is that, 
This is particularly important on the international stage. 
On the margins of his visit to London, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (4 April) on reports of a poison gas attack in Syria’s Idlib province: 
The Syrian health system has collapsed in many parts of the country. 
He said that cooperation with the United Kingdom was crucial with regard to Russia and Turkey as well as North Africa. 
Germany is financing aid projects to make sure that basic healthcare is available to thousands of people.

largest individual pledge from Germany 
Minister of State Roth on amendments to Hungary’s higher education law 
The local health system is in ruins after years of war, and no longer has the capacity to treat the local population. 
Minister of State Roth issued the following statement today (4 April) on the decision by the Hungarian Parliament to amend Hungary’s higher education law: 
We are baffled by the amendments to the higher education law rushed through the Hungarian Parliament today. 
The few remaining doctors and clinics are totally overwhelmed by the flood of refugees from other parts of the country. 
Life-threatening risks 
Over 70 delegations from governments, international organisations and civil society are meeting in Brussels to this end. 
An important step towards improving the situation in Syria is the second international Conference on Supporting the future of Syria and the region, due to take place in Brussels on Wednesday. 
Besides concrete pledges of assistance, the regional dimension of the crisis and the political process are also on the agenda.

Cultural relations between Germany and the United Kingdom also played an important role during the visit.

Across Syria, access to even the most basic health care is no longer guaranteed. 
The conference is therefore also seeking to inject fresh impetus into the intra-Syrian negotiations that are being conducted in Geneva on the basis of UN resolution 2254. 
Since the outbreak of war, hundreds of attacks on ambulance services, hospitals and health clinics have been recorded. 
Less than half of all medical facilities are still functioning. 
Germany ensures provision of emergency medical care on the Syrian-Turkish border 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on reports of a poison gas attack in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun 
Both the use of chemical weapons and targeted attacks on medical facilities violate international humanitarian law, as well as all standards of the international community and in particular the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. 
Large parts of the population have to cope with medical emergencies entirely on their own. 
The British Museum and the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) are organising a joint programme of events in London and Dresden entitled “London Arts Festival: Europe and the World”. 
After his talks with Boris Johnson, Gabriel’s programme included a meeting with David Davis, British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. 
Gabriel met representatives of both museums to discuss this project. 
Making sure that basic care is available 
Gabriel emphasised that international security, for example, could only be guaranteed by working together. 
Oxygen supplies and blood banks are vital for life-saving operations 
© Malteser Hilfsdienst e.V./Mustafa Soltan 
The Government claims that the operating licences of the majority of the foreign institutions affected have to be reviewed due to “irregularities and shortcomings” and that the legislation has therefore to be tightened and rendered more precise. 
They do this by, for example, maintaining blood banks and providing medical oxygen, without which life-saving operations could not be successfully undertaken. 
They also hand out medicines and train medical staff. 
In this way, access to guaranteed medical care is provided for one million people in the project catchment area. 
Each month, some 4500 people benefit directly from treatments that can thus be provided – specialist operations, assisted deliveries and Caesarian sections. 
Minor accidents, childbirth and common diseases thus have the potential to end fatally. 
Large numbers of people continue to flee from the violence in northern Syria. 
Young people from 117 countries, including 44 young Germans, are studying at the internationally-oriented CEU. 
It is therefore all the more difficult for us to understand why the work of the CEU, and thus academic freedom in Hungary, is to be restricted under this new legislation. 
The revised law only targets non‑EU universities, which is why the German Andrassy University is not affected. 
good will, honest communication and willingness to compromise needed 
as Gabriel said, although things will be more difficult initially, the common goal is to work as closely and effectively as possible with the United Kingdom in the long term. 
Gabriel said that Germany and Britain agreed that new momentum had to be injected into the political process. 
The first conference was held in London last year. In Brussels, too, Britain and Germany want to help generate more humanitarian assistance for Syria. 
Food rations have been increased with Germany’s support © WFP 
New initiatives for education and labour market access for refugees in the region helped to create new prospects for thousands of people in a desperate situation. 
While humanitarian assistance can help to alleviate the suffering of those affected, only a political solution to the conflict can put an end to it. 
Another aim is to support the Geneva negotiations on a political settlement to the Syria conflict. 
For many years the traditionally amicable bilateral relations between Germany and the Niger were focused on development cooperation. However, as a result of the European migration crisis and the fragile security situation in the west African region, we have diversified our ties and dramatically increased our links since the start of 2016. 
A little over a year later, the aim in Brussels is to take stock of these successes and to build on and consolidate them. 
Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey are particularly affected by the humanitarian crisis as the host countries to take in the most displaced people and have gone to the greatest lengths to care for the Syrian refugees. 
In 2016, visits were paid by then Foreign Minister Steinmeier (together with his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault) in May, by Development Minister Müller in August, by Chancellor Merkel in October and by Defence Minister von der Leyen in December. 
Millions are now stuck near the border with Turkey. 
Germany opened an embassy in Niamey soon after the Niger gained independence, and is held in high esteem as an early development cooperation partner. 
Now, after years of destruction and violence, it has sunk to 1:4000. 
Before the war, the doctor-to-population ratio in Syria was 1:600. 
The Federal Foreign Office is therefore investing in humanitarian projects run by the Malteser Hilfsdienst e. V. (Health and First Aid Service of the German Association of the Order of Malta), which significantly improve access to healthcare. 
Thanks to its access to the project region, the Malteser Hilfsdienst has also been able to provide emergency shelter for 10,000 people and has distributed blankets to 5000 people to provide some protection against the cold in winter. 
In addition to its own activities, the Federal Government also provides financial support for the work of German non-governmental organisations in the Niger, which has expanded remarkably since 2005. 
Projects are also being funded in the fields of health care, basic education and support for alternative livelihoods. This last field is particularly important to reduce the dependence of people in Agadez Region on migration, which is a source of income there. 
Germany’s programmes are focused above all on the Tillabéri, Tahoua and Agadez Regions. 
This IOM programme is co-financed by the EU Trust Fund for Africa. 
As part of its humanitarian assistance, Germany regularly provides funds to combat the repeated food crises in the region. 
Our emergency aid contributions for the Niger were increased dramatically from the end of October 2016 in connection with the severe humanitarian emergency in the Lake Chad region. 
One new element in our bilateral relations is the presence of German soldiers in the Niger. 
At the end of February, a delegation of the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the States of West and Central Africa visited Ouagadougou. 
During his visit, he gave the opening speech for the Germany Africa Business Forum. 
Implementing organisations of German cooperation – the Reconstruction Loan Corporation (KfW) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) – have offices in the country. 
Numerous German non-governmental organisations as well as the Hanns Seidel Foundation are working together with partners from Burkina Faso to support the country’s development, in many cases with Federal Government funding. 
Bilateral trade is very modest, with Germany recording large trade surpluses. 
Burkina Faso benefits from preferential import tariffs under the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union. 
There are just under 78,000 students learning German at 531 secondary schools who are taught by local teachers. 
A German department was opened at Ouagadougou University in 1982. 
Approximately 1500 students have signed up for the Bachelor’s in German studies and 31 for the newly introduced Master’s in German studies for the 2016/2017 academic year. 
Since 2011, students from schools in Burkina Faso have regularly participated in the International Award Winners Programme of the Pädagogischer Austauschdienst (Educational Exchange Service). 
The academic teaching post funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the University of Ouagadougou has been filled again since 2007. 
In addition, coaches from Burkina Faso regularly participate in further-training measures conducted by the University of Leipzig. 
In early 2010, the now deceased German artist and director Christoph Schlingensief launched an African Opera Village project near Ouagadougou. 
Launched in 2016 and continued in 2017, it has met with a very positive response from the rural population and sparked off socio-political debates. 
An air transport base has been established at Niamey airport to facilitate medical evacuations and provide logistical support for the enlarged German MINUSMA contingent in Gao in northern Mali. This step was decided on early in 2016, since when the base has become operational and a status of forces agreement concluded. 
Agreement regarding Technical Cooperation of 18 June 1977 
Other areas of cooperation include human rights and health care, in particular for women and children. 
Attack in St Petersburg 
Our thoughts are with everyone in Russia. 
The latter three have not yet signed the Treaty. 
The most visible sign of this new relationship is the close succession of visits by senior German politicians to Niamey. 
In return, President Issoufou came to Berlin in June 2016 for talks with Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier. He had last visited Germany in 2013. 
The Niamey embassy was reopened in late summer 2002 after being closed for nearly three years. 
Since 1962, Germany has made available more than 750 million euros in bilateral technical and financial cooperation. 
At the intergovernmental negotiations in 2014, Germany pledged the Niger 62 million euros in funding for the next three years. 
In April 2015, an additional 15 million euros was earmarked for the health sector in light of the Ebola crisis in the region, which fortunately did not directly affect the Niger. 
Further additional commitments (32 million euros) were made in connection with the visits by Development Minister Müller and Chancellor Merkel. 
German development cooperation with the Niger focuses on decentralisation and good governance as well as productive agriculture and food security. 
The Federal Foreign Office furthermore funds projects to foster stability and maintain peace, including a border management project and a police training project, as well as a multi-annual regional programme run by the IOM to assist migrants and facilitate their return and reintegration, and to raise awareness of the dangers they face as a result of human smuggling. 
In addition, German NGOs and political foundations are active in the Niger. The NGOs focus on humanitarian projects, while the political foundations, in particular the Hanns Seidel Foundation and the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, pursue projects to build democratic capacities. 
In the autumn of 2016, a decision was taken to provide project-based logistical support to the Niger security sector in 2017 to combat smuggling and promote border management, making use for the first time of the Federal Government’s Enable & Enhance Initiative. 
The principal bilateral agreements in force between Germany and the Niger are:

The Federal Government is doing its utmost to achieve this end. 
As at the major donors’ conference held in London in 2016, where Germany made the largest individual pledge of 2.3 billion euros, aid for people in Syria is also the focus in Brussels. 
This was the clear signal sent by the London conference, at which the attendees pledged over 12 billion dollars of aid. 
At last year’s conference, the Federal Government made the largest individual pledge, to the tune of 2.3 billion euros, partly in order to encourage further donors to step up to the plate. 
Germany is supporting these countries with numerous projects – from education programmes to specially thermally insulated tents to cash transfer programmes. 
Over 70 delegations are gathering for a conference on Syria in Brussels on 4 and 5 April. 
It is not yet known what was behind the incident. 
Our special sympathy goes to the families of the victims. 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier issued the following statement on 3 April regarding the attack in St Petersburg: 
“I am shocked and saddened by the news from St Petersburg, where an explosive device has killed a number of people. 
I wish the injured a speedy recovery.”

Federal Foreign Office on the attacks in the city of Tikrit 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (5 April) on yesterday's attacks in the Iraqi city of Tikrit: 
The city, which was liberated from the IS terrorists in spring 2015, is a symbol of successful stabilisation policy. 
The members of the Assad regime who are responsible for this barbaric act must be held accountable. 
Russia is an ally of the Assad regime and, as such, bears special responsibility. 
The joint effort to combat the terrorism of ISIS must not cause us to lose sight of the horrible civil war in Syria. 
The fight against ISIS is important. 
But it must not distract us in our efforts to take action against the crimes that are being committed in the civil war in Syria, including torture and poison gas attacks. 
Moreover, Germany will do everything in its power to help those who are being threatened and displaced in Syria. 
Our efforts focus on aiding families and children in Syria, as well as in the neighbouring countries Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. 
food crisis in the Horn of Africa 
Millions of people are at risk of starvation in Somalia and the surrounding region. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to mobilise the international community now. 
The terrorists will not achieve their callous objective. 
We condemn in the strongest possible terms the suicide bombings in Tikrit, which claimed the lives of more than 30 people. 
When the international community finally reacted, the death toll was already half this number. 
Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Iraqi Government in cooperation with international partners, it has been possible to create the conditions to enable many internally displaced persons to return to Tikrit. 
A disaster waiting to happen 
we stand firmly by their side in the struggle to free their country and will continue to do everything in our power to give all Iraqis hope of a peaceful future for their country. 
Gabriel in Brussels 
Mobilising the international community: 
Several droughts in a row, exacerbated by the effects of climate change, have dried out the region in the Horn of Africa. 
Urgent appeal 
Food prices have rocketed. 
Gabriel, together with EU and UN representatives, issued an urgent appeal to ensure that the looming disaster in Africa is not forgotten in view of the situation in Syria. 
Gabriel stressed that it was not yet too late. 
He said that the international community had to take responsibility urgently and make available the funds needed to avert the famine. 
Thousands of people have fled the violence of armed conflict and terrorism, leaving their fields behind. 
In order to mobilise worldwide support, Germany will play an active role at international donor conferences in the coming weeks and will coordinate with aid organisations. 
It also plans to increase its own aid payments. 
Gabriel reported that the Federal Government was going to ask the Bundestag for further funds to this end. 
Mobilising international aid: 
There is no need for the disasters of the past to be repeated. 
Half the cattle perished. The price of grain doubled. 
Nobody can claim they don’t know what awaits the people there, Foreign Minister Gabriel said today in Brussels. 
While hydronuclear tests are genuine nuclear explosions, they release very little nuclear energy. 
Prolonged drought exacerbated by climate change has created a dry wasteland. 
They are also the only three states to have conducted nuclear tests since the CTBT was opened for signature in 1996. 
This spring, signs point to a disaster that could be even worse. 
It is especially important in the face of such heinous acts of terrorism to assure people in Iraq and the Iraqi Government that 
Representatives from 70 states were gathered in the Belgian capital to discuss humanitarian assistance for the people affected by the conflict in Syria. 
As in the case of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, the CTBTO now also routinely transmits its monitoring data to disaster early warning organisations. 
We Europeans want to talk about this with our American partners, too. 
The CTBT prohibits nuclear weapon test explosions as well as other nuclear explosions underground, under water and in the atmosphere. When the CTBT was being negotiated, Germany insisted that all nuclear experiments, including those involving low-yield explosives, must be banned. 
With around 7 million euros, Germany is the fourth-largest contributor to the CTBTO budget after the US, Japan and China. 
the gas attack in Syria is a barbaric war crime – Germany is doing everything it can to help people in Syria 
In the margins of the Brussels conference on Syria, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel today (5 April) issued the following statement: 
The gas attack in Syria is a barbaric war crime. 
There must be no camaraderie with the Assad regime – also not in the fight against the terrorists of the so‑called Islamic State. 
I call on the Russian government to use its role in the UN Security Council to take concerted action with all other civilised nations in the wake of this gas attack. 
We support the demand that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) hold a special meeting to address this case. 
Yesterday’s attack is also a warning signal for Europe and the United States. 
The political process towards obtaining a new constitution, free elections and an end to the Assad regime through democratic means is a prerequisite for bringing permanent peace to the region. 
Germany made available 1.3 billion euros last year for this purpose, and we will be providing an equal amount of aid this year. 
Alongside gathering pledges of assistance, the conference pursued clear political objectives. 
No money for reconstruction 
The aim is to alleviate the people’s suffering. 
Tackling the causes of suffering 
Last updated in March 2017 
German-Slovak relations have traditionally been friendly. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel pledged over one billion euros of additional aid at the conference on Syria in Brussels. 
More than 70 delegations convened on 4 and 5 April in order to discuss concrete assistance for the suffering people in Syria and neighbouring countries. 
This was the clear signal that was sent by the London conference in 2016 where Germany had made the largest individual pledge of 2.3 billion euros. 
This commitment has now been stepped up in Brussels. 
The impact of the crisis extends far beyond Syria’s national borders. 
The quality of bilateral relations is evidenced by the frequency of high-level visits in both directions. 
Transatlantic Coordinator travels to Canada and the United States 
Nevertheless, the world seemed surprised when one of the worst famines of past decades broke out in the region the following summer. 
More than 250,000 people died as a result of the crisis. 
Ahead of his departure, he commented as follows: 
Relations between Canada and Europe are probably now closer than ever 
as was highlighted once more by Prime Minister Trudeau's recent visit to Berlin. 
The rains in Somalia had almost never failed to the extent seen in 2010 and 2011. 
…internationale Gemeinschaft … 
“However, we will not commit any funds to one thing for as long as there is no credible political transformation in Damascus – namely reconstruction”, emphasised Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
With this in mind, Foreign Minister Gabriel thanked Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt in particular: 
Citizens on both sides of the Atlantic will reap the benefits. 
As in previous years, Germany remained Slovakia’s most important trading partner in 2016 in terms of both exports and imports. 
This means that Germany is one of the principal foreign direct investors in Slovakia. 
It is an important signal in these turbulent times that Canada and the EU are making a clear commitment to free and fair trade based on high standards. 
In talks with government representatives and MPs, I hope to explore how we can further tap the potential inherent in our relations. 
It gives me the opportunity to follow on from the many talks I have conducted since the Trump Administration took office. 
There is a lively exchange in all areas of culture, through official institutions, private foundations and private contacts. 
German is the second most important foreign language taught in Slovak schools after English, and as such is a cornerstone for the close relations between the two countries. 
In Los Angeles, the Federal Government recently acquired the house Thomas Mann lived in during his exile. 
38 schools in Slovakia belong to the Schools: Partners for the Future network supported by Germany. 
Germany pledges a further 1.169 billion euros to support people in Syria 
Germany is among the co‑hosts, along with the EU, UN and the United Kingdom, as well as Qatar, Kuwait and Norway. 
In addition to the funds pledged last year, the Federal Government is setting aside a further 1.169 billion euros of additional aid. 
“Without a political settlement, we will continue to treat the symptoms instead of tackling the causes”, said Gabriel. 
One of the conference’s declared aims was therefore to inject fresh impetus into the intra‑Syrian negotiations that are being conducted in Geneva on the basis of UN resolution 2254. 
“We expressly support the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy to bring about a common basis for negotiations”, said the Foreign Minister. 
A crisis with regional dimensions 
“These countries and their citizens are offering millions of refugees asylum, protection and future prospects on a daily basis.” 
I want to use my talks to find out more about how the planning stage is progressing. 
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
“Tsar Bomba”, for example, detonated by the Soviets in 1961, was around 4000 times more powerful than the two atom bombs that were dropped on Japan in August 1945, claiming thousands of lives and rendering vast tracts of land uninhabitable. 
The German Government is therefore committed to ensuring that nuclear tests are prohibited around the world and that the North Korean tests of 2006, 2009 and 2013, as well as the most recent tests of 6 January and 9 September 2016, remain the last of their kind. 
This is also the objective of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
A zero-yield test ban, as this is known, also prohibits hydronuclear tests. 
Ratification status 
Since being drawn up, it has been signed by 183 states, 166 of which have ratified it. 
A global monitoring system – for civilian purposes 
Established to implement the Treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization or CTBTO is based in Vienna. It operates on a provisional basis pending the Treaty’s entry into force. 
The CTBT provides for a global monitoring system to verify compliance with the test ban. Thanks to its International Monitoring System with close to 300 monitoring stations (including 16 laboratories) to record seismic, infrasound and hydroacoustic variables as well as radionuclides, CTBTO is already in a position to detect even small, underground nuclear detonations around the world. 
Five German monitoring stations are part of this system – two seismological and two infrasound stations operated by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources as well as a radionuclide station operated by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

The German minority is well integrated in cultural, social and economic terms, and is generally respected. 
The Federal Republic of Germany supports the Carpathian Germans in their cultural, educational and community-building activities. 
The CETA agreement between the EU and Canada which points the way forward will soon provisionally enter into force. 
This will mean our economic areas will grow even closer together. 
In Boston, the annual German-American Conference at Harvard brings together key decision-makers from the United States, Germany and Europe. 
In talks with representatives from government, business and academia, but also with broad sections of civil society, it will be a matter of underscoring once more our priorities for and expectations of the transatlantic partnership. 
It is to become an important centre for transatlantic dialogue, abstracted as it is from the political hubs on the east coast. 
The Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation, Jürgen Hardt, is travelling to Ottawa, Boston and Los Angeles from 5 to 9 April. 
Cultural and societal relations between Germany and Slovakia are close and extremely diverse. 
German cultural intermediaries – such as the Goethe-Institut, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Central Agency for Schools Abroad – are involved in numerous activities in Slovakia as part of Germany’s cultural relations and education policy. 
– pupils here can study for both the German and the Slovak higher education entrance qualifications. 
The German Abitur can likewise be obtained at the grammar school in Poprad (a “German profile school”). 
They are based on the of Treaty on Good-neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, dating from 27 February 1992, which was recognised by the Slovak Republic as one of the successor states to the CSFR. 
Relations between the two countries are no longer marred by problems relating to the first Slovak state (1939-44) headed by Jozef Tiso under the “protection” of Nazi Germany, the suppression of the Slovak National Uprising by German troops in 1944 and the flight and expulsion of the Carpathian Germans. 
As early as 1991, a declaration issued by the Slovak parliament helped advance the development of a joint perspective on these difficult chapters in the countries’ shared history. 
Germany and Slovakia are close partners in the European Union and NATO, which Slovakia joined in 2004. 
In October 2014, Federal Chancellor Merkel was awarded an honorary doctorate by Comenius University in Bratislava. 
Every year, numerous representatives of the Federal Government, the German Bundestag and Germany’s regional governments and parliaments visit Slovakia, such visits being particularly frequent during Slovakia’s first EU Presidency in the second half of 2016. 
On 3 October 2016, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, then German Foreign Minister, celebrated the Day of German Unity with his Slovak counterpart Lajčák in Bratislava. Lajčák had previously been in Berlin for political talks in April 2016. 
A total of around 500 German companies have made investments in the Slovak Republic since its foundation in 1993, creating around 100,000 jobs. 
The German-Slovak Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Bratislava, which was founded in 2005, now has more than 400 members. 
Since 2015, Volkswagen Slovakia has been the country’s largest private-sector employer. 
The legal basis for all this is provided by the German-Slovak cultural cooperation agreement of 1 May 1997, as well as the Treaty of 1992 referred to above. 
The German School Bratislava (DSB), which opened in 2005, is the flagship institution 
At present, there are 34 schools in Slovakia where pupils can also sit the tests for the German Language Certificate. 
Another bridge between the two countries is formed by the Carpathian German minority in Slovakia. In a national survey conducted in 2011, some 4,700 Slovaks said they belonged to the German minority. This means that the group is still only a fraction of its pre-war size. 
The Slovak Parliament’s Declaration of 12´ February 1991 marked a historic step in the process of reconciliation; it expressed regret for the injustices done in connection with the expulsions in the aftermath of World War II. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (6 April) after talks with the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Cyprus, Espen Barth Eide: 
Since 2015, the two sides have been working tirelessly with the backing of the United Nations to reunite Cyprus. 
That the negotiations have advanced further than ever before is due in no small part to the commitment shown by Espen Barth Eide and his persistent efforts. 
Many major stumbling stones have already been removed during the negotiations. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel after his meeting with the Special Adviser of the UN Secretary-General on Cyprus 
Germany fully and wholeheartedly supports this negotiating process, for reunification would be a huge success for everyone involved and for Europe as a whole. 
I very much welcome the decision by President Anastasiades and Turkish-Cypriot leader Akinci to resume their talks. 
The task now is to persevere and to continue working with courage and a willingness to compromise on the final stretch towards an agreement acceptable to all sides. 
I sincerely wish Espen Barth Eide, President Anastasiades and Turkish-Cypriot leader Akinci every success. 
The UN Cyprus negotiations on the island’s reunification, which began in May 2015, have been conducted by both sides with great commitment and a readiness to compromise. 
An agreement is only possible with the consent of the three guarantor powers Greece, the UK and Turkey. 
Following a break in the negotiations, the community leaders decided to resume their talks on 11 April. 
Cyprus country profile 
The large variety of ideas on how these ties can be further intensified is perfect proof of how close the bonds between our peoples are. 
Minister of State Roth attends Hambach conference on Franco‑German cooperation 
Minister of State Roth issued the following statement today (6 April) in Hambach at the conference on Franco‑German cooperation: 
It is good to know that Franco‑German friendship extends far beyond our day‑to‑day political contacts. There are innumerable close ties in civil society, in the economic and cultural spheres, and at a personal level. 
Looking at the tightly knit network of Franco‑German partnerships and initiatives, one can tell we have a vibrant exchange, and that our relations are, and will remain, multifaceted and dynamic. 
On 6 April, Minister of State Michael Roth, Commissioner for Franco‑German Cooperation, and his French counterpart, Harlem Désir, are joining Minister‑President and President of the Bundesrat Malu Dreyer in hosting the third conference on Franco‑German cross‑border cooperation. The last conference was held two years ago in the French city of Metz. 
This year’s conference is entitled “Franco‑German cooperation in the border region – an ideas workshop for Europe”. 
Some 250 participants from Berlin, Paris, Rhineland‑Palatinate, Saarland, Baden‑Württemberg and the neighbouring Grand Est region are attending the event. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on his joint visit to Mali with his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault 
This evening Foreign Minister Gabriel will leave for Mali, which he will visit together with his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault. 
We have a long-standing partnership with Mali. 
It is a matter of particular importance to me to see Mali for myself and to learn about our engagement at first hand. 
Mali is the key to stabilisation and development in the Sahel region. 
Cross¬border terrorism and organised crime are a threat to security in neighbouring countries, and thus, by extension, to security in Europe. 
We were deeply shocked by the news that a French soldier died yesterday. 
Gabriel travels to Mali: 
working to bring stabilisation 
Mali is a pivotal country for peace and stability in the Sahel region. 
Following our talks in Gao, we will travel to Bamako to visit the National Police Academy. 
Another important theme is peace and reconciliation. 
We have supported the Malian peace process from the outset. 
a Bundeswehr soldier in Gao 
Foreign Minister Gabriel will visit Mali on Friday together with his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault. 
German and French soldiers are deployed on UN and EU missions in Mali. 
Mali is also an example of the constructive and meaningful cooperation between us Europeans. 
After all, were the situation in the country to deteriorate, it would have devastating consequences for the entire Sahel region - and in the medium term, also a major impact on Europe. 
While on this trip, we will therefore also show our profound respect for the work being done by German and French soldiers. 
We will talk to President Keita about the progress made and how the process is to continue. 
The mission: 
This subject will also be addressed in our talks with members of Malian civil society. 
German UN peacekeepers in Mali 
In Gao, on the fringes of the Sahara, 800 Bundeswehr soldiers are deployed. 
In Berlin today (6 April) Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement regarding this trip: 
Working as peacekeepers in the UN MINUSMA mission, they are securing an area previously controlled by Islamist rebels. 
They are doing great things under the most difficult of conditions. 
All in all, more than 10,000 peacekeepers are deployed in the country. 
Together with our European partners and the United Nations, we are actively supporting police training and capacity development and are thereby making an important contribution to stabilising the country and the region. 
Just on Wednesday, a French soldier lost his life in an Islamist attack. 
Gabriel and Ayrault will pay their respects in Gao. 
Consequences for Germany and Europe 
Blick auf… Bamako… 
View of the Malian capital Bamako 
Peace and stability in Mali are not just important for the people in the Sahel region. 
Also for Germany and Europe, the country's development has far-reaching consequences. 
After all, Mali is a transit country for many refugees. 
Stability through training and reconciliation 
In Mali, Germany is following a broad-based strategy to bring long-term stability to the country. 
In Bamako, Gabriel and Ayrault are to visit a police college. 
In a European Union mission, police trainers from Germany are working to improve the training provided for Malian security forces. 
Since 2013, EUTM has trained more than 9000 Malian soldiers to ensure the country can in the future again assume responsibility for its own security. 
Furthermore, the Federal Foreign Office consults with and assists the Malian Ministry of Reconciliation, among others, and supports projects which improve the population’s living conditions. 
Good friends: Gabriel welcomes Foreign Minister Thórdarson of Iceland 
Economic cooperation and the Council of the Baltic Sea States were the focus of the meeting on Thursday (6 April). 
Gabriel and Thórdarson are shown German-Icelandic archival materials 
The footballing heroes of the last European Championship and close friends of Germany: 
“Anyone who wants to know who the Icelanders are should remember the last European Championship,” Foreign Minister Gabriel joked. 
Bilateral relations with Germany have a long history and rest on a broad foundation, in political, economic and cultural affairs. 
Cooperation in economic affairs and in the Council of the Baltic Sea States 
Moreover, Mali is gaining in importance as a country of transit for irregular and forced migration. 
Our sympathy and condolences go to his family and to his friends and comrades on the mission. 
Politically, the two countries not only have their membership of NATO in common. 
Tourism as an economic factor 
Iceland is a popular destination for German tourists. 
Tourism is one of the strongest economic sectors in Iceland, and German tourists are the third largest group by country of origin. 
“We are two countries that are good friends,” Gabriel concluded succinctly. 
I am therefore particularly glad to undertake this visit together with my French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault. 
Further fundamental domestic reforms are needed in Mali if long‑term peace and stability are to be achieved. 
Speech by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth at the Hambach conference on cross-border cooperation between Germany and France 
As you mentioned just now, Hambach is a most significant place in German and European history. 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
I know a thing or two about borders, ladies and gentlemen. 
More than a quarter of a century has passed since the fall of the Wall, and I am still delighted to be able to pass what is now a green border that once divided two whole worlds. 
And because I am familiar with borders, I am quite sensitive to any attempt to put them back up again. 
Allow me to offer you cross-border experts a warm welcome! 
Your cooperation here sets an example for cooperation elsewhere in Europe. 
The vast majority of people on our continent have experienced borders. 
Almost 200 million people in Europe live in border regions. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel enthused about Island as he received his Icelandic counterpart Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson in Berlin on Thursday (6 April). 
Gabriel called Iceland a “strong and great country” of only 330,000 inhabitants, which made it into the quarter‑finals of the tournament. 
Gabriel stressed that the meeting with his Icelandic counterpart Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson was a “particularly nice visit” for this reason. 
German‑Icelandic relations are to be further enhanced, above all in the economic and political spheres. 
Numerous projects are already being implemented by the two countries, including, for example, the construction of a deep‑water harbour in Iceland with German support. 
They also work together in the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) which provides a forum for intensive dialogue and exchange. 
Iceland holds the CBSS Presidency this year. In June it is to host a meeting of the foreign ministers of the CBSS members, which Russia will attend. 
Gabriel and Thórdarson: two ministers who have only been in office for a few months 
They were shifted over the course of centuries, with their populations coming under the wing of a succession of different governments. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the US air strikes in Syria 
Such memories are still vivid especially in Alsace and in parts of Lorraine. 
And Hambach and the Palatinate region were also French in the past. 
The upshot of this situation was that the path towards democracy and unity in Germany underwent a decisive phase especially here. 
Speaking on the sidelines of his Mali trip, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Bamako today (7 April) on the US air strikes in Syria: 
Asked in a survey about barriers that restrict cross-border cooperation, 40 per cent of the inhabitants of border regions considered economic and social, as well as legal and administrative differences to be a problem. 
How can we overcome such hurdles? 
This should be more than feasible. 
Indeed, much has been done already. 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
And yet breathing life into these relations and seeking solutions for everyday coexistence along the border continues to be a huge undertaking. 
It was almost unbearable to watch the UN Security Council prove unable to give a clear and unequivocal response to the barbarous use of chemical weapons on innocent people in Syria. 
Ideas for this have already been drawn up, 
and I am sure that these will also be a topic of discussion today. 
Its goal is to increase the contribution nuclear energy makes to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. 
To that end, it supports measures to improve (operational) safety and protect nuclear installations and materials; it also promotes technical cooperation. 
Its inspections aim to ensure that countries do not misuse nuclear material for military purposes in contravention of their obligations under international law. 
The Agency 
It now has 167 member states. 
Poison gas is an internationally banned weapon. 
The international community agrees on that. 
Germany’s involvement 
Germany is the third largest contributor after the United States and Japan, providing 6.9% of the Agency’s regular budget. 
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements and Additional Protocol 
Under Article III of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) concluded in 1968, it is the task of the IAEA to put in place safeguards with all non-nuclear-weapon countries. The aim is to ensure that fissionable materials are not diverted from declared nuclear activities to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
Only a new and democratic Syria will bring lasting peace. 
Europe and Germany stand ready to do so. 
By February 2016, a total of 146 countries had signed the Additional Protocol, and it had entered into force in 129 (including Germany and all EU member states). 
The terrible events of recent days demonstrate that the conflict parties in the region, and the US and Russia, will also be required here. 
this means that they are important for the production of fuel rods for use in civilian nuclear power stations and research reactors but are also essential for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
One concrete project in this regard is the “international fuel bank”, the IAEA Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank, currently being set up by the IAEA in Kazakhstan. 
From the end of 2017, the LEU Bank is intended to have its own stocks of low enriched uranium which it can sell to IAEA member states if their fuel supplies cannot be guaranteed in another way, i.e. by the world market. 
This additional degree of security of supply is intended to motivate countries not to build up their own national enrichment capacities. 
Security of nuclear power stations and nuclear material 
The IAEA promotes the exchange of experience in matters related to the safety of nuclear power stations. It also organises voluntary safety inspections, during which plant operators are advised by colleagues (peer reviews). 
The Agency has developed fundamental standards in this area. 
Promoting the use of nuclear technologies 
Through technical cooperation measures, the IAEA supports many developing countries in the use of nuclear technologies, including in medicine (especially in the fight against cancer), hydrology (water dating through isotope analysis) and pest control (e.g. sterilisation of disease-bearing tsetse flies or mosquitoes). 
Some 6.6 billion euros have been set aside from the EU budget for Interreg projects in border regions for the 2014-2020 period. 
With his trip, Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to show why the Bundeswehr engagement in Mali is now more important than ever. 
For years now, the huge desert state in western Africa has been troubled by terrorist attacks and attacks by Islamist militia. 
Visiting troops in the dangerous northern area 
Gabriel and Ayrault will not just have talks with President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta in the capital Bamako but will also travel to the dangerous area in the north of the country. 
The UN mission aims to monitor compliance with the peace agreement which the Government signed with some rebels in 2015. 
MINUSMA is considered one of the most dangerous UN missions in the world. 
Terrorism and violent conflict destroy the people's hope for the future and cause economic misery, meaning that migration to Europe seems for many to be the only way out. 
With 140 Bundeswehr soldiers in the European Union mission EUTM, Germany is working to train the Malian armed forces. 
President of the Bundesrat Malu Dreyer, 
Members of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, Members of the German Bundestag and the Land parliaments under Vice-President Gebhardt, Minister of State Harlem Désir, Minister-President Kretschmann, President of the Regional Council Richert, Minister of Finance and European Affairs Toscani, Mayor Ries from Strasbourg and Mayor Gros from Metz, 
I was born in Heringen (Werra), a small town in northern Hesse right by the former inner German border on the western side. 
Until recently, I couldn’t imagine that we would want to build new fences and walls in Europe once again and that parties openly advocating isolation and new borders with nationalist and populist slogans would turn out to be so popular. 
This is one of the reasons why I am particularly delighted to meet so many people here at Hambach Castle who know how to overcome borders and how to go about the process of integrating border regions. 
You are making an invaluable contribution to the ongoing process of European integration. 
These borders can be very old or still very new. 
Different traditions, legal systems, languages and cultures converge in border regions. 
Europe’s diversity is showcased particularly vividly here. 
You are well acquainted with this precious legacy and 
You know and experience day in, day out that 
borders should no longer divide us today, but should bring us together. 
This is particularly the case in the Schengen area, which offers citizens a particularly high degree of mobility and freedom. 
The Federal Government and the European Commission are supporting integration and connectivity on both sides of the EU’s internal borders. 
a project that seeks to optimise the cooperation between health care administrations and health care providers in the Upper Rhine region), in environmental protection (such as the Interreg projects “Energiewaben – regional energy supply for the greater region” and “Power to Heat for the greater region” that collaborate with universities and companies from Germany and France) and the creation of jobs.

Background information on UNESCO Associated Schools: 
We must now do all we can to support the work of the United Nations so that a political solution to the civil war can be achieved. 
It is understandable that the United States has now responded with an attack on the military structures of the Assad regime which were the source of this horrific war crime. 
Understandable though the US military strike on military infrastructure was after the failure of the Security Council, it is now crucial to engage in joint efforts for peace under the aegis of the UN. 
Young people especially must be given the opportunity to benefit from this Europe without internal borders. 
And I mean all young people, not only students, but also those in vocational training programmes and young career entrants.

the Franco-German border region shows how diverse and advantageous cooperation can be on issues that have a direct impact on citizens in border regions. 
The dismantlement of systematic border controls and freedoms of the single market have given rise to manifold opportunities, particularly in border regions, that yield benefits for the population on both sides of the border. 
There are tangible advantages for citizens on both sides of the Franco-German border. 
And both examples are quite literally cross-border in nature. 
I would like briefly to mention two examples of developments that have occurred since our conference in Metz two years ago. 
Taking a taxi is not the only way to cross the Franco-German border, however. 
A further project in the area of public transport is the tram connection between Strasbourg and Kehl, which has been reopened after being discontinued following the war. 
Planning and construction of the bridge over the Rhine were co-financed with EU funds from the Interreg programme. 
They are all wonderful Europeans. 
Stakeholders from Germany and France are sharing the remaining costs for the construction of the bridge. 
UNESCO is also supporting this goal with the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development. 
This is about much more than a course of study or vocational training. 
The European Campus brings together around 115,000 students in three countries. 
That is exactly the kind of experience we need to encourage others to make today, so that our young people will become tomorrow’s committed Europeans. 
The first Franco-German employment agency opened in Kehl, Land Baden-Württemberg, in February 2013. 
This is part of the mission of the Franco-German Youth Office, which conducts a wide range of programmes and activities in the border region. 
Employees of the German and French employment authority work alongside each other in Kehl. 
Much has been accomplished since our last meeting in Metz. 
I was able to gain an impression of their excellent work on a visit last year. 
But we did not come here today to celebrate our achievements and pat each other on the back. 
Much work remains to be done, and we will keep up our efforts. 
The employment agency’s main task is to provide information about job offers and facilitate placements for job-seekers on both sides of the border. 
This cooperation has since been extended to five further locations. 
Moreover, the employment ministers of Germany and France, Andrea Nahles and Myriam El Khomri, presented an action plan for Franco-German vocational mobility in February 2016. 
What better example is there of this, ladies and gentlemen, than cross-border cooperation between Germany and France? 
If not here, then where? 
Germany and France have now concluded a cross-border taxi agreement that allows passengers on both sides to cross the border and to be brought back again. 
The Strasbourg tram is scheduled to cross the Rhine and run as far as the railway station in Kehl from this month, with an extension to Kehl’s town hall also in the pipeline. 
What is more, we adopted the treaty law on joint river policing in the Federal Cabinet just yesterday. 
While this is admittedly a comparatively small piece of the puzzle, it shows why cross-border cooperation can serve as a model for European integration as a whole. 
The common protection of borders is a recurrent topic of European discussions at the present. 
Looking at the issue on a small scale and applying lessons learned to the big picture 
can pay dividends here too. 
However, if we genuinely intend to be successful in the EU in the long term, we must refute the nationalists and populists – 
not in grandiose political speeches or lofty manifestos, but by improving living conditions in a tangible way and, above all, investing in employment and education. 
It’s about personal development. 
Let that be the spirit in which we roll up our sleeves and carry on! 
There are, for instance, multiple forms of cooperation in the higher education sector between Germany, France and also Switzerland and Luxembourg at regional level. 
We will hear more about the greater region’s university in the third panel later on. 
Or consider the Franco-German University, which, with its 16,000 graduates in 2015, is a unique model within the European context of bilateral cooperation in the higher education and research sectors. 
Some 1430 job-seekers were helped to find employment in the border region in 2016. 
This initiative seeks to improve the integration of job-seekers, especially those aged 45 and above, into the cross-border employment market and to help companies recruit employees. 
There are many such projects that aim to develop cross-border vocational training. In 2016, I had the opportunity to meet with young French participants who were being trained at Badische Stahlwerke. 
This is helping to interconnect training and research beyond national borders. 
The older ones among you often had formative experiences while abroad on a school exchange, especially through exchanges between France and in Germany, or with an Interrail pass, or as a youth camp leader. 
One thing is particularly important to me, and that is staying in touch with young people. 
In 2016, 345 Germans and Frenchmen and women earned a certificate in a Franco-German vocational training programme. 
Just think, they have no knowledge of German, and most of them have dropped out of school. Yet each of them decided to cross the Rhine River every day to seize a new opportunity in Kehl. 
That is why I am especially pleased that, in March 2017, the Franco-German Secretariat celebrated the enrolment of the 100,000th participant in the Franco-German vocational training exchanges. 
Allow me to offer the Franco-German Secretariat and all participating companies my most sincere thanks for their long-standing and successful efforts. 
We must win the hearts and minds of young Europeans if we want to build a Europe of tomorrow that is based on solidarity. 
All those who in their youth travel abroad and interact with people from other countries are, as a rule, much less likely to buy into nationalist slogans than those who are never given the opportunity to meet and talk to foreigners. 
Thank you for inviting me to Hambacher Castle for the third conference on cross-border cooperation between Germany and France. 
are doing your utmost to preserve it. 
Let’s continue to make progress in this area so that our border regions can continue to play a leading role in Europe for forward-looking solutions also in the future. 
With a relatively small budget, the projects that are being supported achieve a host of tangible results for citizens – be it the development of traffic links, cooperative projects in the education sector (such as the “Success Without Borders” project, which promotes cross-border training programmes or entire training courses in the respective neighbouring country), in health care (one example to mention here is TRISAN, 
A good example of this is the “PAMINA-Fachkräfteallianz” project. 
As soon as Land Baden-Württemberg and France have signed the agreement, the river police forces on the Rhine, which have worked together successfully since 2011 to ensure greater security for Rhine river traffic, will be able to operate on a firm legal basis. 
Especially these days, when our European Union, and our ideas about Europe, have come under stronger pressure than ever, Europeans must provide tangible proof of the benefits that can be enjoyed through tearing down and crossing borders. 
"'Bringing Agenda 2030 goals into the classroom" 
How can the Sustainable Development Goals be communicated in the classroom? 
This is the question under consideration at the conference of heads of German UNESCO Associated Schools in the Federal Foreign Office. 
On 5 April, Minister of State Maria Böhmer, together with Qian Tang, UNESCO Assistant Director-General, and Verena Metze‑Mangold, President of the German Commission for UNESCO, opened the conference of heads of German UNESCO Associated Schools in the Federal Foreign Office. 
Sustainable Development Goals as a challenge 
"The Global Action Programme and the Sustainable Development Goals as a challenge for the development of the UNESCO Associated Schools Network". In six working groups, the participants developed new ideas and momentum to enable the Sustainable Development Goals to be better implemented in schools. 
True to this principle, the working groups were chaired by pupils from the Evangelische Schule Berlin Zentrum.

"It is important to bring the Agenda 2030 goals into the classroom." 
For us, the network of the German UNESCO Associated Schools is of crucial importance. 
After all, that is what you are committed to with great personal dedication as heads and with your fellow teachers in UNESCO schools. 
"UNESCO schools set an example and play a pioneering role. 
The importance of education for sustainable development and the appreciation of cultural diversity are emphasised in the Sustainable Development Goals. 
I hope many schools will follow on from the example of the UNESCO Associated Schools and do even more to promote these goals. 
After all, they are decisive for our co‑existence and the cohesion of our society." 
In Germany, 250 schools are members of the UNESCO Associated Schools Network. 
There are 10,000 education institutions in 180 countries around the world who belong to this international network. 
In their curricular and extra‑curricular activities, UNESCO Associated Schools actively support UNESCO's goals. 
The basis of their work is the recommendation adopted at the 18th UNESCO General Conference in 1974 concerning education for international understanding and cooperation. 
The focus is particularly on sustainable education as reflected in the fourth Sustainable Development Goal: 
“Let’s get the job done” 
Global consensus 
German and French Foreign Ministers shocked by attack in Stockholm 
We are deeply shocked to hear that Sweden, too, has now become victim of an act of terror of this nature. 
Our northern neighbour’s engagement for human rights, peace and justice is exemplary. 
At this difficult time we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Swedish friends. 
I am extremely concerned by the news from Russia about the persecution of homosexuals in Chechnya. 
Our dismay in response to the images from the very heart of Stockholm is therefore all the greater. 
We expect the Russian Government to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to the statements made by local authorities in Chechnya. 
Erler concerned about reports on the persecution of homosexuals in Russia 
The Federal Government Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, Gernot Erler, issued the following statement today (7 April) on reports from Russia claiming that homosexuals have been singled out for persecution and some even killed on account of their sexual orientation in the constituent republic of Chechnya. 
I call on the Russian Government to investigate these terrible reports and, should they turn out to be true, to offer those affected the assistance they require with immediate effect and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
I also wish to call to mind in this regard Russia’s international obligations, particularly the right to life, the prohibition of torture and the right to freedom and security. 
We feel for the people of Sweden, and our thoughts are with them, the victims and their families and loved ones. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attack on a Coptic church in Egypt 
We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. 
Video: Foreign Minister’s trip to Mali 
The background to the attack must now be investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. 
Speaking in Bamako today (7 April) on the fringes of their trip to Mali, the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany, Jean‑Marc Ayrault and Sigmar Gabriel, issued the following statement on the events in Stockholm: 
We hope that the circumstances surrounding this appalling act can be clarified swiftly. 
The perpetrators’ plan to undermine peaceful coexistence by driving a wedge between people of different faiths must not be allowed to succeed. 
Christians have thus yet again been targeted in an act of bloodshed. 
At the heart of the 2030 Agenda are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
which replace the MDGs and have a stronger emphasis on the multidimensional nature of sustainability than was the case in the past. 
We grieve with the Egyptian people and the families of the victims and our thoughts are with those injured. 
The aim is not to leave the weakest and most vulnerable behind in the process. 
This ambitious global transformation programme seeks to offer future generations prospects for a dignified life. 
Today of all days, Palm Sunday, the terrible news has reached us of an attack on Christians in a Coptic church in Tanta, who were worshipping together in joyful anticipation of Easter. 
Guiding principles 
The objectives are inseparably linked and go hand in hand with each other. 
This order must pursue the aim of global justice if we intend to fight poverty and hunger successfully, avoid refugee movements and get on top of climate change. 
we must join forces in tackling these great tasks. 
(Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel) 
The 2030 Agenda was adopted by all member states of the United Nations in New York on 25 September 2015. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (9 April) on the attack on a Coptic church in Egypt: 
We as Germans support efforts to stabilise Mali. 
Why is that important for us in Europe, in Germany? 
These range from eradicating poverty and hunger to good education and climate protection. 
The 2030 Agenda is, and I’m not exaggerating when I say this, a milestone for the international order. 
It brought together the two negotiating processes of the poverty and development agenda of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
That’s why we need and want to help. 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
Lastly, let me say we both know that the circumstances of the engagement are difficult. Families, children, partners at home are worried. 
All those involved therefore deserve our thanks. We politicians need to explain to our people the importance of what the soldiers here are doing also for security in our country, in Europe. 
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda safeguards development financing for the 2030 Agenda. 
National and international implementation 
Mali is a major trouble spot giving rise to terrorism and, of course, forced migration. 
It is also an extremely poor country where many young people see no prospects if they stay. 
But another factor is that we don’t just want to watch regions descend into starvation, poverty, war and civil war. That is why the Bundeswehr, the French forces and many others here are making such a significant contribution. 
Measurable indicators, published every two years, are assigned to each of the 17 SDGs. 
The Sustainable Development Goals 
The German Sustainable Development Strategy is therefore the primary national framework document for implementing the 2030 Agenda and for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in, through and with Germany. 
The UN member states report on their progress in implementing the SDGs at this forum. 
More information on the various SDGs 
The countries define their national contribution based on their resources and their level of ambition. 
All areas of the political arena, as well as actors from civil society, the business world and academia, are involved in the efforts to implement these objectives. 
The Federal Government adopted the German Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 as the essential framework for the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 
In the strategy, the Federal Government sets out its implementation plan for the Agenda and specifies what it is doing to achieve this objective. 
Responsibility for stability and development: 
Current crises 
Preparations are under way: 
Topics of discussion include current crises and conflicts in international politics. 
Long-term stabilisation 
A special session on Syria is also scheduled to take place on the fringes of the meeting. 
Around six weeks before the G7 Summit, they are set to discuss displacement and migration, counter-terrorism and sustainable development. 
the Palazzo Ducale in Lucca is being decorated with flags of the G7 countries 
One focus is on displacement and migration. The G7 countries intend to work together more closely on this, especially regarding efforts to combat the causes of refugee movements. 
the agenda for the G7 Foreign Ministers meeting in Italy on 10 and 11 April is wide-ranging. 
From Syria to Russia and Africa to cyber foreign policy, 
The main topic of discussion is long-term development and stabilisation, however. 
One focus in this regard, also within the context of the German G20 Presidency, is Africa. 
The G7 is seeking to de‑escalate the situation with long-term concepts for prevention and stabilisation. 
G7 instead of G8: 
2016 meeting ... 
The objective of the 2030 Agenda is to shape worldwide development in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable way. 
The Sustainable Development Goals are united by five core messages (people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership), which act as guiding principles. 
Ambitious and comprehensive objectives for 17 areas were set out with the SDGs. 
This catalogue of objectives aims to achieve a transformation of the international community towards far greater sustainable development by 2030. 
Unlike the MDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals apply equally to industrialised countries, emerging economies and developing nations. 
This multi-stakeholder approach is an expression of the international community’s belief that global challenges can only be mastered sustainably by working together. 
In its revised 2016 version, the strategy places an emphasis on the international dimension and therefore comprises a host of foreign policy indicators. 
Germany presented its first implementation report to the HLPF in 2016.

The annual High‑Level Political Forum (HLPF) serves as an implementation mechanism at the international level. 
The 2030 Agenda thus intends to break with the principle of donor - recipient relations and to lay the foundations for a transformed global partnership. 
G7 Summits have taken place since 1975. The Group was expanded to become the G8 with the addition of Russia in 1998 and met in this format until March 2014. 
Europe’s neighbouring continent is grappling with conflicts and famines while the impact of climate change is making itself felt and there are considerable movements of refugees and migrants.

As leading industrial nations, they bear a particular responsibility for crisis prevention and sustainable development.

As a result of the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation, the heads of state and government of the other seven members decided at the time to meet the reduced G7 format until further notice. 
Foreign Minister Westerwelle to open Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) meeting – Germany takes over MTCR chair 
The MTCR is the main multilateral forum for combating the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. 
Minister, how and when did you learn of the US air strike? 
Has Trump’s attack increased the chances of ending the war or has the US attack worsened the situation? 
Could a world war now break out between the US and Russia? 
No. I even assume that the US informed Russia of its impending military action in an appropriate manner. 
But one thing’s certainly true: seldom since the end of the Cold War has the international situation been as critical as it is now. 
All sides must now keep calm. 
What we don’t need is further escalation. 
That’s why it is so important we now finally undertake joint peace efforts under the auspices of the United Nations. 
You’ve said that the air strikes were understandable. 
However, they have no foundation under international law nor were they authorised by the United Nations. 
The use of chemical weapons is a blatant and brutal violation of international law. 
That’s why their use is banned under international law. 
Assad’s thugs are unscrupulous repeat offenders. 
I certainly still remember the images of the murderous poison gas attacks in 2013. 
That’s why I said it was understandable that the United States has now responded with an attack on the military structures of the Assad regime from where this horrific war crime originated. 
I stand by that. 
Why are you so certain that Assad was responsible for last week’s poison gas attack? 
We’ve all seen the shocking images of the chemical weapons attack on people in Khan Sheikhoun. 
Should we provide the US with military or logistical support in any further operations? 
The Bundestag mandate is clear: we’re using our military capabilities to support the fight against the IS terrorist militia, but not a war against Syria. 
Can the German Government put pressure on Russia’s President Putin to drop his support for his partner Assad? 
Did you contact Russia after the air strike or are you planning talks with Russia? 
I’m in close contact with my Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. 
And I don’t get the impression that Russia will protect Assad for ever. 
That makes it all the more important that we now make progress in the UN talks. 
What should happen to Assad? 
We’re dealing here with a murderous regime responsible for unspeakable crimes, hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees. 
The Assad regime has caused a level of suffering for so many people that is almost unparalleled in today’s world. 
I’m certain that Assad will be brought to justice for these crimes, be it in the long or short term. 
At any rate, Assad’s future is already behind him. 
Interview with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the situation in Syria following the poison gas attack and the US air strike. 
I was informed via satellite telephone during a night flight to Mali. 
The use of poison gas is a serious war crime and an act of true barbarity. 
I very much hope that the international pressure will prevent the Syrian regime from violating international law in such a cruel way again and from using poison gas against innocent men, women and children. 
It’s now of vital importance that we overcome the divide in the UN Security Council and that the peace efforts are advanced under the auspices of the United Nations. 
For if this terrible conflict has shown anything it’s that only a political solution supported by Russia, the US and key regional powers can bring an end to people’s suffering. 
Did the US present proof to its allies? 
It’s important that the United Nations and the experts of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are now granted immediate access and that they can carry out their investigations unhindered. 
Furthermore, the information we’ve received from our partners and from local contacts makes it seem very plausible that the Assad regime is behind this terrible poison gas attack. 
“We had good talks on Syria here in Lucca. 
None of the G7 countries want military escalation, but rather a political settlement without a further spiral of violence. 
We want to persuade Russia to support the political process for a peaceful solution to the Syria conflict. 
This is also the express stance of the US Secretary of State, who has our full support for his talks in Moscow on Wednesday. 
I welcome this very clear position by the United States, which sent the Assad regime a clear message with its military attack, but does not want escalation, but rather to work with Russia. 
We should meet soon at foreign minister level in the International Syria Support Group. 
I think it is right to attempt inclusion once more. 
Foreign Minister Sigmnar Gabriel issued the following statement on the margins of the G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Lucca today (11 April) after the talks on Syria: 
We need to get the Vienna process off the ground again as soon as possible. 
Not everyone may like this, but without Moscow and Tehran there will be no solution for Syria. 
This is why exclusion is definitely not the way forward. 
I do not like to imagine that Russia will remain loyal indefinitely to such a brutal regime as Assad’s, which knows no bounds whatsoever.”

First global economy summit held in 1975 
Germany was represented by Helmut Schmidt (second from left). 
The global economy changed dramatically during the 1970s. Markets were rocked by the first oil crisis, while growing global trade revealed ever greater flaws in the fixed exchange-rate system. 
The Group of Seven came into existence when Canada attended the summit the following year. Since then, the industrialised countries have met annually to discuss current political and economic issues. 
As a result of the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation, the Heads of State and Government of the other seven members decided to meet in the smaller G7 format until further notice. 
The presidency of the G7 rotates annually among the members. 
Germany last chaired the group in 2015, hosting the summit in June that year at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria. 
The Group of Seven (G7) regards itself as a community of shared values. 
It comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Union is also represented. 
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States work together in the Group of Seven (G7). 
Italy holds the G7 Presidency in 2017. The annual G7 summit will take place in Taormina on 26 and 27 May 2017.

For this reason, the Heads of State and Government of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States met at the first “global economy summit” in Château de Rambouillet in France in1975. 
Until March 2014, the group included Russia and met as the G8. 
Working session at the G7 Summit in Schloss Elmau, 8 June 2015 
The most visible element of the summit process is the annual summit of Heads of State and Government, which is hosted by the country holding the G7 Presidency and usually held around halfway through the year. 
The summits give the Heads of State and Government an opportunity to exchange views face to face 
and serve as a launchpad for joint initiatives. 
G7 Foreign Ministers meetings 
The G7 Foreign Ministers also meet on a regular basis to discuss foreign and security policy issues. 
The first meeting of G7 Foreign Ministers during Germany’s Presidency was held in New York on 25 September 2014, on the margins of the UN General Assembly. The second meeting took place in Lübeck on 14 and 15 April 2015, 
where the focus was on current critical issues, such as the situation in the Middle East and Ukraine. 
The 2017 Foreign Ministers meeting was held in Lucca, Italy, on 10 and 11 April.

Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth on his talks with the Hungarian Ambassador 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth commented as follows after meeting with the Hungarian Ambassador Péter Györkös today in Berlin (11 April): 
I took the opportunity to express our concern regarding the amendment of the Hungarian Act on Higher Education. 
Incomprehension does not however mean that we are at a loss for words. 
I informed the Hungarian Ambassador that we are honestly worried by many of the things happening in Hungary at the moment. 
In the Council of Europe, in particular, Hungary is increasingly the retarding force as regards human rights issues such as LGBTI. 
Nevertheless, I still think it is important for Hungary to understand why we are so concerned. 
That was the goal of today’s talks. 
Today’s meeting with the Hungarian Ambassador was part of this series. 
The amendment targets the Central European University directly. 
For this reason, I too made it clear that we view this amendment, which was moreover adopted using a fast-track procedure, with incomprehension. 
It is our observation that Hungary is increasingly on a collision course with the EU and its institutions, and is also espousing views at international level that do not reflect the EU consensus. 
The European Union is above all a community of shared values, which can only function if all of us resolutely uphold and defend those values. 
Significant doubts also exist as to whether the new stricter Hungarian legalislation on asylum is in any way compatible with EU and international law. 
Minister of State Roth regularly holds talks with the ambassadors of the various EU countries. 
The Hungarian Ambassador and I spoke openly and amicably today. 
G7 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Lucca 
We discussed all these issues but, as you can imagine, the talks focused on the situation in Syria and relations with Russia. 
For we have a shared responsibility for many issues facing the world today, from how to create peace and security to climate change and questions relating to international migration. 
We are very glad that the new American Administration, represented by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, made it clear here that it aims to work with Russia to restart negotiations in Syria which can put an end to the civil war and bring about the transition to a democratic country. 
Standing Together Against Famine 
Article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, published in the “Berliner Morgenpost” of 12 April 2017 and elsewhere 
The G7 meeting which ended today showed first of all that such meetings are extremely useful. 
We all remember clearly the horrifying images of the food crisis that struck East Africa a few years ago: 
underfed infants and small children, families who had lost their herds and thus had no food and no income, parched fields, old people too weak to search for food and water. 
People around the world are even now at risk of acute malnutrition. 
The United Nations has already declared a state of famine in some regions of South Sudan. 
The UN warnings are alarming and have to rouse the international community to action. 
They are now dependent on rapid assistance to meet their most basic needs for drinking water, food and hygiene, for example. 
Farmers are no longer able to tend their fields because the ground is too dry, because they have sold their tools and because there are no seeds available. 
Even now, children have stopped attending school and instead have to walk for days to collect water. 
They are defenceless in the face of the violence that surrounds them. 
The German Government has not been caught unawares by the crises. Already last year we doubled our humanitarian assistance for Africa, in particular for Nigeria, South Sudan and the Somalia crisis, to 270 million euros. 
For aid measures to be undertaken on this scale, it is essential that the United Nations is able to act. 
Germany is one of the biggest humanitarian donors worldwide and does what it can to enable people affected by crisis, violence or catastrophe to survive in dignity. 
Germany’s increased international responsibility also has to be reflected in the Government’s humanitarian assistance. 
We will take this to heart this year, too. 
But I also have to say that 
Germany cannot avert these catastrophes alone. The international community must stand strong and work closely together. 
That is why I convened a meeting in Berlin today together with the major aid organisations. 
Food crises are not spontaneous natural disasters. 
We have to increase people’s resilience to make sure that such crises are not repeated. 
But right now 
we have to assume more responsibility in order to face up to the growing challenges. 
Starvation will not wait for a political settlement. 
Only by providing swift humanitarian assistance can a catastrophe of even greater proportions be averted. 
The situation is particularly acute in north‑eastern Nigeria, the Horn of Africa and Yemen – veritable famines are looming there. 
More than 100 million people are starving and in need. 
This could happen again in 2017. 
More than 20 million people are affected in these four crisis areas alone. 
According to the United Nations, roughly 5.6 billion US dollars are needed for humanitarian relief measures in Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia in order to avert a catastrophe – and of that, 4.4 billion dollars are urgently needed by the middle of the year. 
The extreme food scarcity is however also caused by the worsening political crises in South Sudan and Yemen and by the continued activities of terrorist organisations – Boko Haram in parts of Nigeria and Al‑Shabaab in Somalia. 
By way of comparison, that’s a good 0.25% of global arms expenditure in 2015! 
The situation has already deteriorated over the past year: rains have failed, and the El Niño effect has led to widespread crop failures and rising prices. 
This increases the pressure on these fragile regions and people who have no way of building up any reserves. 
In light of the dramatic situation in Yemen, we increased our assistance to 33 million euros in 2016. 
The German Government thus supports the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which pays for quick and targeted aid measures in such crisis situations. 
In 2016 alone, we made 50 million euros available to CERF. 
This money was used by aid organisations to provide food and drinking water, to combat malnutrition in small children, to provide basic health care for people in need, to continue to provide for refugees in camps even under conditions of extreme drought, to enable children to go to school, to prevent livestock from perishing, and to make it possible to continue farming. 
Other donors have to live up to their responsibilities, too and make available more resources and step up their commitment to humanitarian assistance. 
That is why we hold frequent talks with other donors and with aid organisations. 
Our Berlin Humanitarian Call is intended as a wake‑up call for the international community. 
And we have to work together with our partners to step‑up our political commitment to resolving the crises and continue to foster stability in the fragile regions. 
A whole package of short, medium and long‑term measures is needed to prevent crises on this scale in the future. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on his trip to Serbia and Kosovo 
Foreign Minister Gabriel commented as follows ahead of his trip to Belgrade and Pristina: 
However, we have recently seen that some of the wounds of the past go deep and can still cause tensions, even today. 
For this reason, I leave today for Serbia and Kosovo, on my first trip to the Western Balkans, and will visit Albania next week, in order to see for myself what the situation is. 
I will reassure my interlocutors that 
We want to continue to support the countries of the region as they develop their democratic and rule-of-law structures and move towards stability and prosperity. 
Encouragement on the road towards the EU: Gabriel travels to Serbia and Kosovo 
“The road to the EU will remain open if they opt for progress and reform instead of division and stagnation.” 
A crucial phase for a key country 
Gabriel will first visit Serbia, the key country in the region. 
Support for the rule of law and democracy 
“We want to continue to support the countries of the region as they develop their democratic and rule-of-law structures and move towards stability and prosperity”, stated Gabriel before he set off for Belgrade. 
As Serbia’s foremost trading partner, Germany is important to the country, which traditionally also has close relations with Russia. 
Continuing the reform course towards the European Union would send an important message to the entire region. 
Normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo 
Germany plays a key supporting role in Kosovo when it comes to developing stable state structures. 
However, the region has come a long way since then.

Nevertheless, the election triggered major demonstrations by those unhappy with the country’s current development. 
At this critical stage, the German Foreign Minister wants to gain a first-hand impression of the situation and will meet, among others, the newly elected President and acting Head of Government. 
This includes stable democratic structures with a free press and room for peaceful demonstrations. 
For this is also a fundamental prerequisite for moving further along the road towards the EU. 
The Bundeswehr is one of the biggest contributors of troops to the KFOR mission, which ensures security in the country. 
And since the Kosovo war in 1999, Germany has been one of the country’s largest bilateral donors, providing more than 550 million euros for emergency measures, humanitarian assistance and for technical and financial cooperation. 
One key issue on both legs of the trip will be the question of how Serbia and Kosovo can further normalise their relations. 
The civil war in the 1990s left scars in the Western Balkans which are felt to this very day. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel therefore travels to Serbia and Kosovo on Wednesday (12 April) with a message of encouragement:

And yet it is vital to investigate this incident as rapidly as possible and to send a clear signal that the international community will not tolerate the use of such illegal and inhumane weapons. 
We expressly support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has already commenced investigations into these crimes, and call on the Syrian regime to grant the organisation access with immediate effect. 
On 2 April, Aleksandar Vucic won the country’s presidential elections by a clear margin. 
Turning to the time-frame, he went on to say that the reform tempo and the normalisation of relations with Kosovo were decisive. 
Both were basic prerequisites for accession to the EU. 
It is most regrettable that the Security Council has, as a result of a further Russian veto, failed to adopt a resolution condemning the dreadful events in Khan Sheikhoun. 
Before meeting Vucic, the President-elect and outgoing Prime Minister, Gabriel also commented on the protests. 
“It is good that peaceful demonstrations against a democratically elected government can take place here without state intervention.” 
One of Kosovo’s largest donors 
Germany stood firmly at Serbia’s side on its road to Europe, as Gabriel underscored in Belgrade. 
What meaning does the preservation of cultural property have for young people? 
Marking the launch of a new information campaign, the Federal Foreign Office entered into debate with pupils in Leipzig.

The destruction of cultural property due to terror, war or natural disasters poses a threat to humankind’s cultural heritage. 
The destruction of the past also endangers the present and the future.

Protecting, preserving and rebuilding cultural heritage is thus a field where Germany is active. 
Learning the ropes of cultural preservation 
…Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium … 
Cultural heritage is not just stones or buildings from the past but in fact has a lot to do with the present, with our background and our sense of belonging. 
We Germans want to stand firmly at Serbia’s side on its path to the European Union and to play our part in improving living conditions here in the country. 
Contribution to intercultural understanding 
We see Serbia as a country that has worked to foster stability in the entire region in recent years, but has also pursued a very committed and ambitious path towards the European Union. 
The discussion also focused on how pupils in UNESCO Associated Schools can make a contribution to intercultural understanding, monument protection and cultural preservation. 
Welche Bedeutung… 
Aleksandar Vučić, a big election win is something to be very happy about, but it also means plenty of work, as the victor has great responsibility. 
He is responsible for the reform process and of course for further developing relations with Kosovo. This is a prerequisite for the European Union ultimately being able to agree to accession. 
The Sultanate of Oman 
Germany is held in high regard in Oman. 
Oman's Foreign Minister Alawi travelled to Berlin in August and November 2015 for talks with the German Foreign Minister. 
Economic relations 
In 2015, German exports to Oman were worth 942.8 million euros. 
The German Länder regularly send delegations to Oman for talks.

It’s not yet too late. 
German companies are involved in a number of infrastructure projects in Oman:

Europe was also a key issue for Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 
Gabriel wants to do something “unheard of” and pay more to the EU.

Sigmar Gabriel is absolutely right in seeking a change in mentality among the political elite.

I think this is long overdue. 
The debate on net contributors doesn’t get us anywhere. 
That won’t be possible with today’s budget. 
Berlin Humanitarian Call – Standing Together Against Famine 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Berlin Humanitarian Call 
By the time the international community responded, it was already too late for most of the victims. 
The famine that is emerging this spring has the potential to become far worse. 
But I remain optimistic that the French want to continue being part of the centre of the united Europe. 
It had already substantially increased its contributions to aid programmes in the past year. 
National elections in the EU member states always have an impact on Europe as a whole and on all partners. 
The country’s humanitarian assistance to help tackle the crisis is now being increased by a further 400 million euros. 
Gabriel and Müller issue an appeal to the international community with the Berlin Humanitarian Call. 
Germany is one of the world’s biggest donors of humanitarian aid. 
People are always invoking the “Franco-German engine”. 
We did not fully exploit the political potential of our cooperation in recent years. 
The growing number of German tourists visiting Oman has tipped the balance of trade in Oman’s favour. 
There are 500 German citizens living in Oman. 
Cultural relations 
It is only in recent years that German higher education institutions have focused their interest on Oman’s education market, as on those of the other Gulf states. 
Bilateral relations in the cultural and education sectors focus on cooperation in science and technology, in particular with Oman’s Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Heritage and Culture, as well as between German universities and the Sultan Qaboos University and the University of Nizwa. 
Language instruction is offered mainly by universities and colleges, including the Sultan Qaboos University, the University of Nizwa and GUtech. 
Cultural preservation is everyone’s business: 
Minister of State Roth debates with pupils

since 1981, Germany has been helping to protect cultural heritage around the world. 
Pupils from the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium present their projects. 
At the launch of a series of information events on the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office, Heidrun Tempel, the Director for Research and Academic Relations Policy and Cultural Relations Policy, debated on Tuesday, 11 April 2017 with pupils from UNESCO schools in Leipzig on the importance of preserving humankind's historic and cultural legacy. 
The pupils of the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium proved this with their own cultural preservation projects such as "UNESCO world heritage in a shoebox" or their project week looking at the cultural heritage of the Sorbs. 
For Heidrun Tempel, this is the basis for peaceful co-existence, cultural diversity and dialogue with other cultures. 
Together with the chair Mirko Drotschmann, Aino Moongo, curator of the Namibian cultural preservation project "Stolen Moments – Namibian Music History Untold", and Thomas Ladenburger, founder and project head of "Virtual Museum Djemaa El Fna", light was shed on the background to and mandate of cultural preservation as a way of strengthening national identity and on involving local populations. 
As part of this series of events, the Federal Foreign Office will be uploading videos in the coming weeks on eleven selected projects such as the rescuing of centuries-old Islamic manuscripts from Timbuktu, the preservation of the Angkor temples and the creation of a digital register of Syrian cultural property. 
Trade and investment, SME development, renewable energies, environmental protection, education and training, healthcare and tourism were agreed as the main fields for cooperation. 
It brought together some 160 entrepreneurs from family firms who discussed regional economic topics and talked about the challenges that entrepreneurs face in different cultures. 
Omani family businesses took advantage of the forum to strengthen their relations with German companies. 
Siemens has supplied turbines for gas-fired power plants in Sohar and Barka and Munich Airport has provided consulting services for developing Muscat and Salalah Airports.

There are currently some 1500 Omanis learning German. 
In the future, many of the finds from this site are to be put on show at the newly built National Museum in Muscat. 
Filippo Grandi, Gerd Müller, Ladies and gentlemen, 
For the first time since 2011, the official UN line is that this is a famine. 
However, unlike then, this comes as no surprise. 
from distributing food and water to mobilising donations. 
We have therefore intensified our political and humanitarian efforts in the Federal Government and have, in consultation with our international partners, endeavoured to mobilise further funding. 
Firstly, we need more money! 
And for its part, France needed a lot of energy on the domestic front in order to carry out its reforms in the face of massive protests. 
Incidentally, wealthy states are also among those to close their eyes to what is going on in the world. 
The pedantic attitude of some German politicians towards France didn’t go down well there. 
And yet we have earmarked around 136 million euros for humanitarian assistance in Nigeria, South Sudan and in the Horn of Africa for 2017 and will request once again that the German Bundestag increase this funding. 
In other words, 
Bilateral political consultations were held in Berlin in May 2014; the 14th meeting of the Joint Economic Commission was held in Muscat on 5 and 6 December 2016. 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier visited Muscat in March 2016. 
German Bundestag President Lammert visited Oman in March 2013, Bundestag Vice‑President Roth in March 2015. 
Federal President Wulff paid a state visit to Oman in December 2011. 
The activities of German companies in Oman since the 1960s have helped to successfully build a robust infrastructure in the Sultanate and have created a considerable degree of trust. 
Most recently, Bavarian State Minister Merk visited Muscat in February 2017. 
Germany’s principal exports to Oman were industrial chemicals, motor vehicles and components, pharmaceuticals, plastics and machinery. 
While humanitarian assistance may be impartial and apolitical, calling for humanitarian access is not. 
The 14th meeting of the German‑Omani Joint Economic Commission, which was set up in 1978, was held on 5 and 6 December 2016 in Muscat. 
Imports from Oman amounted to 48 million euros in 2015. 
Germans currently make up the second‑largest group of visitors from Europe, after Britons. 
In higher education, there are ties between the state‑run Sultan Qaboos University and German universities as well as with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and German research institutions. 
We have clear political demands for the parties to the conflict in Yemen as we need aid organisations to be able to get supplies into the country via the port of Al Hudaydah, and without coming under fire. 
The actual value of German exports to Oman is probably higher as some of them reach Oman via the United Arab Emirates. Germany is not a direct buyer of Omani oil and gas. 
A bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement entered into force on 4 April 2010. 
The German‑Omani double taxation agreement, which was signed on 15 August 2012 in Muscat, has yet to be ratified by the German side and negotiations are currently ongoing. 
In 2013, aggregate German direct investment in Oman was worth an estimated 55 million euros. 
Over the past few years, Germany has become an important trade fair venue for Omani entrepreneurs. 
Germany has had a pavilion at the BIG Show in Muscat every year since March 2012, as it did again in 2016. 
Cooperation in healthcare is to be stepped up based on a memorandum of understanding signed by the two countries’ health ministers in January 2011. 
Since 2005, Omanis have been coming to Germany to study under the Omani government’s scholarship programme. 
Our aid can help to alleviate conflicts, but it won’t resolve them. 
In the field of scientific research, the Helmholtz Association signed a cooperation agreement with the Research Council (TRC) on 1 June 2015. 
We must intensify our commitment to stabilising difficult and fragile regions. 
In December 2006, an agreement to set up the private German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech) was signed with the German partner RWTH Aachen University. 
It began operating in Muscat in autumn 2007. 
some two‑thirds are women. 
In the winter semester 2016/17, 1615 students were enrolled at GUtech in various engineering and economics programmes, 
GUtech relocated to Halban at the beginning of the 2012/13 winter semester, commencing teaching there in October 2012. 
The Faculty of Urban Planning and Architecture’s flagship project Eco House won a competition organised by Oman’s Research Council in 2012. 
Since the beginning of the 2012/2013 academic year, German has been offered as second foreign language at five state secondary schools in Oman. 
In 2017, a group of archaeologists from the University of Tübingen, the sixth to do so, spent time working on an excavation near Al Khashba. 
Two of the schools have been admitted to the Schools: Partners for the Future network (PASCH). The Goethe-Institute engages in cultural work from its regional base in Abu Dhabi. 
In archaeology, there are long‑standing bilateral contacts with German universities and research institutions. 
The Federal Foreign Office funded the investigation and restoration of prehistoric tombs in Bat. 
GUtech is advising Muscat Municipality on urban development projects such as the restoration of the city’s historic quarter Muttrah. 
New excavation projects are planned with the University of Heidelberg in 2017. 
Relations in the sports sector encompass football, hockey, volleyball and track and athletics. 
To this end, we intend to make more aid available in South Sudan, as we also pledged to do in Oslo for the Lake Chad region. 
The founding in Muscat of the Omani‑German Friendship Society, with HH Sayyid Tariq bin Shabib Al Said as its Honorary President, was officially announced in June 2014. 
The Berlin‑based German‑Omani Association, which was founded in Bonn on 4 September 1992, also seeks to develop friendly relations between the two countries and promote cooperation in culture, business, science, academia and sports. 
Political relations are friendly and untroubled. 
Germany has always been one of Oman’s key economic partners. 
In November 2014 and November 2016, the Owners Forum Middle East was held in Muscat. 
Alongside this there are several individual science projects as well as contacts of the Fraunhofer FOKUS. 
None of this must be a flash in the pan. 
All of these things are, at the end of the day, important to us for humanitarian reasons. 
This is a strange impression that sometimes arises in the public debate. 
It is therefore important to us to also find out from you what we should do and how underlying conditions ought to be changed. 
And, of course, we also request that you support our Berlin Humanitarian Call not only in Germany, but also in your international cooperative partnerships and networks. 
The famine in the Horn of Africa and in the Lake Chad region can still be averted. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Development Minister Müller therefore issued an appeal to the international community with the Berlin Humanitarian Call today. 
The world seemed surprised when one of the worst famines of past decades broke out in the Horn of Africa in 2011. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Grandi, ICRC President Maurer and Development Minister Müller 
“Nobody can claim they don’t know what awaits the people there,” said Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
Together with Development Minister Müller, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Grandi and ICRC President Maurer, Gabriel therefore issued an appeal to the international community today with the Berlin Humanitarian Call. 
“Germany cannot avert this catastrophe alone,” said Gabriel. 
Sigmar Gabriel and Gerd Müller had invited UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross Peter Maurer and representatives from a great number of additional aid organisations to the Federal Foreign Office to hold discussions at the conference on the Berlin Humanitarian Call. 
A wake-up call for the international community 
The Berlin Humanitarian Call is therefore intended as a wake-up call for the international community. With the Berlin Humanitarian Call – Standing Together Against Famine, Foreign Minister Gabriel and Development Minister Müller are appealing to the international community, countries, companies and individuals to support the work of aid organisations. 
We can and must do more together to prevent an even greater disaster. 
Is the UK Government still deluding itself as regards Brexit? 
We want close and friendly relations with the British, but the priority is cohesion among the EU27. 
There are generations and nations – as Scotland describes itself – in the UK that have a clear pro-European stance. 
Unfortunately, it decided differently. 
I do not want to interfere in domestic discussions in the UK and Scotland. 
The tone between the West and Russia is also becoming harsher. 
Are we facing a war, including outside Syria? 
That is why the renewed attempt to include Russia is the right approach. 
Luxembourg’s Foreign Minister is calling for tougher EU sanctions against Syrian President Assad. 
Is the EU able to do anything at all? 
The EU needs to play an active role in the talks on Syria. 
This brutal civil war must be stopped. 
And let’s not forget that Germany and the Europeans are doing a great deal as regards humanitarian aid. 
He acted in Syria without a Security Council mandate. 
How predictable is Trump’s foreign policy? 
Three months after Donald Trump’s inauguration, the US seems to be keen on playing its role as a global force for order to a greater extent once again. 
However, the opposite of isolationism is not national dominance, but rather multilateralism and close cooperation with all partners. 
The EU and Germany have repeatedly reached out to the US in this regard. 
The first step has been achieved, and I am glad about that. 
However, we will not content ourselves with this. 
What are the chances of Yücel being released? 
The accusations that he is an agent or a terrorist are untenable and absurd. 
Deniz Yücel is a journalist. 
When do you expect him to be released? 
We will continue working on Deniz Yücel’s behalf until he is released. 
Like many other people, I am deeply moved by his situation. 
Interview conducted by Sonja Gillert and Daniel Friedrich Sturm 
Published in “Die Welt” newspaper on 13 April 2017. 
I am pleased that Foreign Minister Gabriel is also very keen to spell out that Germany’s place is in the heart of Europe. 
Many politicians talk about Europe from a business, accounting or small-minded point of view. 
“We want to invest more money in a better Europe” 
We want to invest more money, but in a better Europe. 
Everyone says that Europe should do more as regards defence, development cooperation, migration policy and jobs. 
The entire EU needs to contribute more. 
Germany should lead the way because it benefits enormously from a capable Europe. 
What would it mean if Le Pen got through to the run-off as the strongest candidate? 
Anything is possible, as we unfortunately saw with Brexit. 
It would be bad enough if a right-wing extremist, who angles for votes in the anti-Semitic cesspool, won the first round. 
If Le Pen won, would this be a death sentence for the EU? 
Is Scotland “most welcome” in the EU? 
Like the German Chancellor, the French President is a major player in European policy. 
Almost nothing can be achieved without the French President. 
How do you find this cooperation? France is in an economic slump and has a weak president, while things in Germany are largely going well as regards the economy and politics. 
France has been, and will remain, our closest partner. 
Speaking self-critically, I would say we could have achieved more. 
Germany and France must become role models and driving forces in the EU once again. 
The good cooperation in our border regions on the labour market and training, which we explored again during our Franco-German meeting in Hambach Castle last week, is an outstanding example. 
Too many politicians in London believe that the UK can continue to benefit in full from the advantages of the EU as a non-member. 
But there can be absolutely no question of cherry-picking. 
We need to see how we can now make the best out of it. 
Would Scotland be “most welcome” as a member of the EU, as 50 European politicians recently wrote in a letter to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh? 
They have my support. 
The UK would be most welcome if it remained in the EU. 
And although it really goes against the grain for some people, there will be no solution for Syria without Russia and Iran. 
The EU is called on to speak with one voice in this conflict, 
However, sanctions do not seem to have changed anything so far. 
And there is consensus among us that neither sanctions alone nor military action will automatically bring about a solution. 
Ultimately, a lasting solution will only be achieved via an orderly political process. 
US President Trump is suddenly getting involved in international affairs. However, he seems to be doing so without prior agreements. 
I am relieved if President Trump recognises that a complete withdrawal from the international arena does not make anything better. 
Is a further visit likely? 
Our aim is that Deniz Yücel be released in line with due process. 
But Deniz Yücel is not the only concern. Turkey must respect freedom of opinion and freedom of the press. 
Statement by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the referendum in Turkey 
According to a survey, independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen are neck and neck again in the first election round in France. 
Last week, he received his first consular visit. 
Our sympathy goes out to the victims and their families. 
The people of Turkey were called on to vote on an amendment to the constitution of the Republic of Turkey. 
and respects the right of the Turkish people to decide on their own constitutional order. 
A political settlement is the only way out of this spiral of violence and counter-violence. 
This means great responsibility for the Turkish Government and for President Erdoğan personally. 
The German Government expects the Turkish Government to now seek respectful dialogue with all political and social forces in the country, following the tough referendum campaign. 
As a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and as a candidate country for EU membership that is bound to the EU’s Copenhagen criteria on democracy and the protection of fundamental rights, the Turkish Government must now respond to these concerns. 
Minister Müller’s statement flags up a great dilemma. 
The German Government notes the preliminary outcome of the referendum 
The test obviously failed. 
The German Government would like to thank the OSCE referendum observation mission for its work in the run-up to and during the referendum. 
Regardless of whether or not a test is successful, this represents a clear breach of international law. 
The German Government regards this assessment as particularly important. 
Michael Link, Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, already expressed doubts last week that fair conditions for the referendum would be upheld. 
The German Government recalls that the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission expressed grave concerns both on the process and the content of this constitutional amendment. 
We condemn the collision course of the regime in Pyongyang on behalf of the Federal Government and call upon North Korea to return to international norms. 
Yet again, people in Syria have been targeted in a callous attack. 
Everyone who can exert influence on the parties to the conflict in Syria must play their part in bringing the senseless killing to an end and in getting all parties back to the negotiating table. 
This year, North Korea has conducted more missile tests than in the same period in 2016 and is thus showing it is willing, despite clear warnings issued by the international community, to again heighten tension. 
At 6.20 am today (16 April), North Korea launched an as yet unidentified missile from its Sinpo missile basis. 
When I heard the dramatic appeals for aid from the United Nations recently, it was clear to me that the situation in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria is more calamitous now than it has been for a long time. I’m sure that your response was quite similar. 
This is why we must do everything in our power to prevent a catastrophe of this nature. 
The convoy was part of an agreement between opposition groups, the Hezbollah and the Syrian Government on the evacuation of four towns, of which two were besieged by opposition groups and two by groups supporting the regime. 
Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the missile test in North Korea 
Today, on Easter Sunday morning (local time), North Korea again tested a missile. 
Pursuant to relevant UN Resolutions, the country is not permitted to conduct ballistic missile tests due to its nuclear programme. 
Allow me to come back to the reason for inviting you here today, however. 
What we want above all is to find out which measures, which aid, which underlying conditions you believe are required in order to avert a famine. 
This is not a colossal master plan that claims to solve all of the problems, but a modest programme of work that is intended to show you what we have in mind and where we ask for your support. 
This is not so much your responsibility, but that of governments and private donors. 
If you take part in international conferences on a regular basis, then you will have noticed that it is always the same people who are asked for help at each conference and always the same people who don’t even show up to the conference, just to be on the safe side. 
And this means, of course, that you reach the limits of what is politically feasible at some point. 
Let’s consider an example. If you say “many thanks for giving us a certain sum of money” to the members of the Bundestag’s Budget Committee on Friday and then come back again on Monday and say “by the way, there’s another disaster for which we’d like to ask you to set aside further funds that aren’t covered by the budget”, then this will work for a while, but not forever. 
Minister Müller and I have already mobilised approximately 100 million euros from the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and 100 million euros of the Federal Foreign Office budget and, with the support of the German Bundestag and the Finance Minister, we intend to add a further 200 million euros to what we have already pledged. 
We will therefore set aside money for Yemen and also contribute 50 million euros to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). 
Secondly, we need not only money, but also greater political will. 
This is why it is vital to keep on emphasising the importance of humanitarian access. 
In Somalia, the clans must reach a lasting agreement to stop urgently needed supplies from having to take roundabout routes. Furthermore, the Sudanese Government must open up corridors and keep these open in order to allow food to be transported to South Sudan. 
This is another reason why we will meet again at a donors’ conference for Yemen in Geneva on 25 April and at a further conference in London on 11 May to talk with our partners about increasing funding, and this is why Germany intends to set a good example. 
Minister Müller once said in another context that if the international community is mooting a two percent guideline with respect to arms expenditure, then we should, at the very least, consecrate 0.7 percent to ODA. 
My personal opinion is that it would be better the other way around, i.e. two percent for ODA and 0.7 percent for arms expenditure. 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement this morning (17 April 2017) on the Turkish referendum on an amendment to the constitution: 
I therefore also believe that it would meet with great approval in our country if we were to set ambitious goals for ourselves and internationally, including for sustainable development. 
The close outcome of the referendum shows how profoundly divided Turkish society is. 
This would, incidentally, reduce the need for such high levels of defence expenditure. 
We should not anticipate the OSCE election observers’ final report on Monday. 
Political talks on this matter must take place as soon as possible with Turkey, both at bilateral level and between the European institutions and Turkey. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement on the attack on a convoy of evacuees from the Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (16 April) on the attack on a convoy of evacuees from the Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya: 
The news of the attack on the convoy of evacuees from Foah and Kefraya is deeply shocking. 
Dozens of people were killed on Saturday afternoon in an attack on a convoy of evacuees from the Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya. 
It is not yet known who was responsible for the attack and the Government and opposition have put forward different versions. 
Back then, many people said that they didn’t have a chance to prepare properly. This isn’t a valid excuse this time around as it’s obvious that the various factors such as war, civil war, drought, climate disasters and refugee flows are coinciding. 
All of you work in these crisis regions on a daily basis and are doing tremendous things under extremely difficult conditions that many people can barely imagine in their everyday lives – 
And you are working to facilitate humanitarian access in order to give people what they need most urgently. 
With this in mind, I would like to present the priorities that we believe will help us to make progress. 
There’s a snag here, however. 
And at some point, people will ask “why is it always these six, seven or eight countries and not the others?” The question as to how we can reach more countries is therefore out there. 
Thirdly, we need greater stability in the region. 
Fourthly, all of this will require considerable staying power. 
I think that we must, in public, clearly avoid the impression that we only want to tackle famines because we are out to protect ourselves from refugees. 
The exact number of victims has not been established but Syrian state television spoke on Saturday evening of at least 39 dead and the Syrian White Helmets of around 100. 
We find ourselves in a situation in which the entire world is contemplating how to build up military capacities – sometimes for understandable reasons, sometimes not. 
And given the sums that are under discussion, we should actually be profoundly ashamed if we fail to raise four billion euros for the crises, including the one in the Horn of Africa, which represents but a small fraction of the amount that is being touted in the defence sector. 
We’re talking here about internationally binding law and are, unfortunately, living through an age in which abiding by the international legal order appears to have fallen out of fashion somewhat. 
We must actually do far more internationally to ensure that the funds and institutions of the UN are equipped with assets on a permanent basis, rather than having to appeal for money each and every year. 
When all is said and done, comprehensive security cannot be guaranteed by the military alone. And so I am particularly delighted that both Minister Müller and I are on the same page here. 
I think that this is a question of decency and moral integrity and that we cannot look away and ignore the UN Secretary-General’s calls for help. 
In stark contrast to his predecessor Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is highly involved in European policy.

An historic opportunity 
Gabriel talking to Albanian Prime Minister Rama:

Remarkable progress has been made in the Western Balkans over the past years. 
Albania submitted its application for EU membership in 2009, and it has been a candidate country since June 2014. 
Ahead of the parliamentary elections scheduled for 18 June, the opposition has decided to institute a parliamentary boycott. 
Judiciary reforms are vital 
In addition to his meetings with Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, and with his counterpart Ditmir Bushati, Gabriel also met with Lulzim Xhelal Basha, leader of the opposition and Chairman of the Democratic Party. 
“Refocusing attention on the well-being of the people must again be the top priority. 
Political selfishness is not helpful in this regard.” 
Germany wants to continue to support Albania as it develops its democratic and rule-of-law structures and moves towards stability and prosperity. 
During his talks, the Foreign Minister emphasised that 
Parts of the opposition are no longer participating in parliamentary procedures, which means they are blocking urgently needed reforms. 
This is also having an impact on efforts to draw the country closer to the EU. 
Before accession negotiations can begin, however, reforms must be carried out in a few key areas. 
On Monday, during his first official visit as Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel wanted to gain a first-hand impression of the current situation. 
caught between progress and political standstill 
Albania has paved the way for impressive progress. 
However, two months ahead of its parliamentary elections, the country is at a political standstill. 
Germany will continue to support Albania as it moves down the path towards stability and prosperity 
Besides the fight against corruption and efforts to strengthen human rights, reforms of the judiciary are particularly important. 
But these reforms are now far from being implemented. 
This is putting a halt to the reform process, as well as blocking further steps towards the EU. 
Sigmar Gabriel used this opportunity to urge the opposition to end its parliamentary boycott and re-engage in the political process. 
Any continuation of the opposition’s destructive boycott would jeopardise the progress Albania has made, as well as its steps toward the EU, the German Foreign Minister said. 
He added that judiciary reform and progress in the remaining four key areas were vital for drawing closer to the EU. 
“the road to the EU will remain open if you opt for progress and reform instead of division and standing still.”

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the UK Prime Minister’s decision to hold an early general election 
Predictability and reliability are more important than ever since the Brexit vote in the UK. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel gave the following statement to Funke Mediengruppe today (18 April) on the UK Prime Minister’s decision to hold an early general election: 
I hope that the early general election announced by Prime Minister May today will lend the negotiations with the European Union greater clarity and predictability. 
Any prolonged uncertainty is surely not to the benefit of political and economic relations between Europe and the UK. 
The Federal Foreign Office is funding a new type of insulation material for Syrian refugees’ tents in Lebanon. 
Two-year-old Hasham with his mother Dalal al-Askar 
“We used to feel the wind as if we were outside. 
Dalal al-Askar has been living in Bar Elias in Lebanon for three years. 
The farmer who owns the field rents plots for 100 dollars per month and tent. 
Germany is one of the largest donors. 
Bild … IKRK … 
The ICRC has insulated all the tents with aid from Germany. 
The aid organisation is co-funded by the Federal Foreign Office’s Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance. 
“We had to spend a long time experimenting.” 
The material had to be firm, non-flammable, easy to use and, above all, not too expensive. 
“It works extremely well,” Bahlak says. 
“Obviously, no firms make something like insulation material for tents,” he says. 
Bild: …Hasham… 
“It was much better,” the 26-year-old says. 
Humanitarian aid is stabilising the region 
Bild: … Bekaa-Hochebene … 
Tens of thousands of refugees live in the Beqaa Valley close to the Syrian border. 
as the war in Syria has already been raging for six years. 
The farmer supplies electricity for an extra 20 dollars per month. 
UNICEF has built simple latrines between the tents that can also be used as showers. 
Most Syrian children go to school in Bar Elias and the ICRC funds a small clinic where refugees receive medical care. 
Basic needs are met. 
“I pray every day that we can go back soon.” 
A small step is of great help to Syrian refugees in Lebanon 
Dalal al-Askar, who comes from Raqqa, the stronghold of the terrorist militia “Islamic State”, has come to see her tent in the field in Bar Elias as something like home. 
Dalal al-Askar often thinks about Raqqa. 
Dalal al-Askar will never forget the first night after her family’s tent had been insulated. 
It was the first time that her three small children did not suffer from the cold. 
Now it’s warmer and not as draughty. And we no longer hear as much sound from the other families.” 
The Directorate-General is in charge of the Federal Foreign Office’s overall coordination of the German Government’s policy on Europe. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s European Directorate-General was established in 1993. 
The Syrian border is so close that you can see it. 
Dalal lives in a field with several hundred other refugees from Syria. 
The fact that Dalal al-Askar no longer needs to heat the tent at night is a great help to the family’s modest budget, which is comprised of UN aid and casual work by her husband. 
The refugees’ tents have been fitted with an insulating layer by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
Brexit is also among the European Directorate-General’s current tasks. 
Germany is one of the largest donors to the ICRC and the Lebanese Red Crescent Society. The aim is to ensure that refugees who want to stay close to their home are able to live in dignity. 
Suleiman Bahlak of the Lebanese Red Crescent Society, who was responsible for carrying out the project on the ground, says it was difficult to find the right material. 
In the end, the choice was to use the thermoplastic material polyethylene, measuring 12 mm wide and lined with aluminium. 
The insulation material is attached relatively tightly to planks at the internal tent walls and lasts for several years. 
Aid organisations and donor countries such as Germany have had to think in the long term for quite some time, 
Lebanon, whose own population is only 4.5 million people, is currently home to 1.2 million Syrian refugees. 
This means that humanitarian aid does not only help to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, but also to ensure that Lebanon, which is already fragile, is not destabilised by the burden. 
The refugees themselves have also realised that their temporary living situation in Lebanon will not be a short-term situation. 
The tent has a small oven, and inexpensive carpets and mats line the floor. 
The family has set up a separate kitchen area with a gas cooker and an ancient and very noisy fridge at the back of their temporary accommodation. 
However, this does not alleviate the homesickness felt by most Syrians, who talk constantly about their homes and fields. 
Devising, shaping and coordinating Germany’s policy on Europe 
Effective coordination is the only way to ensure a reliable and predictable German policy on Europe for our partners and, at the same time, to make it possible to effectively safeguard German interests. 
In the winter, temperatures in this mountainous region around the Beqaa Valley fall to below freezing, and even in the spring it is not much more than four or five degrees Celsius after sunset. 
A temperature difference of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius can be achieved for just 150 dollars per tent. And this works in both hot and cold weather. The high temperatures in the summer are also a problem for the refugees. 
The ICRC has insulated 6000 tents in the Beqaa Valley and 17,000 tents in Lebanon overall. 
In fact, her youngest son Hasham was born there. 
Bilateral exchange and regional cooperation 
The country divisions coordinate intra-European cooperation, bilateral exchanges and regional cooperation, for instance in the Baltic and Danube region. 
They cultivate and shape bilateral relations with the other 27 EU member states. 
The objective of the European Directorate-General’s work is to expand and maintain the excellent intra-European relations. 
The material ensures a temperature difference of between 10 and 15 degrees in both hot and cold weather. 
Political dialogue with Malawi’s government and development cooperation are the cornerstones of bilateral relations. 
The country has little revenue of its own to cover government expenditure, which means it is largely dependent on international donors. 
Germany is one of the country’s major bilateral donors, along with the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Norway and Ireland. 
Germany’s bilateral development cooperation with Malawi focuses on the priority areas basic education, health care and development of the private sector in rural areas. 
Important cross-cutting issues in development cooperation are public finance management, HIV/AIDS and gender equality. 
The Federal Government suspended direct budget support to Malawi in December 2010 owing to domestic political developments there, in particular restrictions on freedom of the press and the tightening of penal legislation. 
The weaknesses in terms of transparency and accountability in Malawi’s public finance system that were made public in September 2013 during what became known as the Cashgate scandal (involving the systematic misappropriation of millions of dollars in public funds) represent, for the time being, an obstacle to the resumption of direct budget support. 
For many years, a German-led team of palaeoanthropologists have been conducting hominid research in Malawi and were instrumental in setting up the Cultural and Museum Centre Karonga in the north of the country. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s European Directorate-General focuses on issues concerning the EU and the advancement of the European idea. 
The United Kingdom Task Force, which coordinates the German Government’s work surrounding the UK’s exit from the EU, was established within the European Directorate-General. 
The European Directorate-General is, in particular, responsible for preparing the General Affairs Council at the level of Foreign Ministers and Ministers for Europe, as well as the European Council of Heads of State and Government. 
The European Directorate-General liaises closely with other units of the Federal Foreign Office and other Federal Ministries in order to formulate and coordinate German interests and to advocate them either within the framework of the EU or bilaterally. 
A key part of its work is strengthening cohesion in Europe by promoting European solutions and close bilateral cooperation with the EU member states. 
The future of the EU as an integration project and its migration policy are further focuses. 
The Directorate-General is also responsible for negotiations on the multiannual financial framework, i.e. for the EU’s spending policy. 
The Federal Republic of Germany has maintained uninterrupted diplomatic relations with Benin since 1960. 
Since the end of the dictatorship in 1990, bilateral relations have been good, 
the focus being on development cooperation. 
There have been a number of high-level visits in recent years. 
Federal President Köhler visited Benin in December 2004; Benin’s President Boni Yayi visited Germany in October 2006 and January 2013. 
Sports and Youth Minister Homeky travelled to Bonn and Berlin in June/July 2016 and Planning and Development Minister Bio Tchané visited Berlin in February 2017. 
German trade with Malawi is poorly developed and its volume largely dependent upon crop yields and price developments for raw tobacco and sugar. 
In 2015, Malawi therefore ranked 129th out of a total of 239 countries and states trading with Germany (source: Federal Statistical Office). 
The Malawian Government and the donor community have, to date, geared their development policy to the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy, MGDS II, which expired in June 2016. 
Moreover, Malawi is one of the priority countries of the special initiative One World – No Hunger. 
German as a foreign language is taught at a PASCH school in Malawi, which receives support in the form of a position for volunteers under the Federal Foreign Office’s “kulturweit” (Bridging Cultures) programme. 
Bilateral cultural relations are also fostered by the German Embassy in Lilongwe, which provides financial support for cultural projects, organises scholarships, promotes sport and provides sports equipment. 
Education is a focus of German development cooperation with Malawi. 
Germany is helping Mali to improve training for teachers and to construct more school buildings. 
In addition, a delegation headed by the Minister of Secondary, Technical and Vocational Training visited Germany in February 2017. 
Germany has been engaged in development cooperation with Benin since 1960. 
Benin is a partner country of German development cooperation, 
owing mainly to the country’s recent political development into a liberal democracy since 1990. 
The results of this “democratisation dividend” are not yet sufficient. 
Government cooperation is conducted on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in the framework of joint technical and financial cooperation programmes implemented by GIZ and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW). 
The German-Beninese development programme is highly acclaimed. 
With the conclusion of the intergovernmental negotiations in Berlin in September 2016, total bilateral commitments since 1960 rose to nearly 900 million euros. 
The next intergovernmental negotiations are scheduled to take place in 2019. 
Cooperation is conducted in line with the development objectives of Benin’s Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (Stratégie de Croissance pour la Réduction de la Pauvreté), in which Benin’s Government outlines its development plan for the various sectors. 
The German-Beninese cooperation programme agreed in September 2016 for the period 2016 to 2019 is worth some 70 million euros. 
With additional pledges up to the end of 2016, this sum increases to around 88 million euros. 
Cooperation focuses on the following three areas: 
Apart from the United Kingdom, Germany is the only EU country to have an embassy in Malawi since the country gained independence. 
Decentralisation and local development 
Germany supports the national policy to expand local autonomy and local responsibility for social and citizen-oriented public services and grass-roots political participation. 
German companies have made only very few direct investments in Malawi. 
The idea is also to shift fiscal responsibilities from national to local level. 
Drinking water, water management, sanitation and solid waste management 
Malawi is one of the world’s least developed countries. 
In 2015, it ranked 170th out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index. 
Germany is helping the Beninese Government to improve living conditions for the country’s population by ensuring year-round access to clean drinking water and preventing disease by improving sanitation. 
Food security and agriculture 
The principal multilateral donors include the World Bank, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank. 
Given the importance of agriculture in reducing poverty and for Benin’s national product and food security, the Government is being advised on the implementation of the national agricultural strategy. 
Aggregate German development cooperation provided to Malawi since its independence stands at approximately one billion euros, and at more than 1.5 billion euros if German contributions to multilateral donors are factored in. 
In tandem, the value-added chains of agricultural products (cotton, shea, cashew nuts, rice, etc.) are being supported in rural areas across Benin, 
also taking into account climate change, the conservation of natural resources and the increasing involvement of the private sector. 
An important contribution to cultural relations is made by German development cooperation projects in Malawi’s education and training sectors. 
It has an additional volume of approx. 26 million euros. 
Development cooperation also works in the following areas: 
Furthermore, various private foundations, associations and initiatives collect donations in Germany and construct school buildings in Malawi. 
In order to increase transparency and efficiency, German experts are providing macroeconomic and financial sector advice to decision-makers in Benin’s administration as part of technical cooperation. 
In addition, in the country’s primary education sector, local education authorities are being advised on the comprehensive development of organisational structures aimed at improving the quality of education. 
Malawi’s prime imports from Germany include electrical appliances, vehicles, machines and chemicals. 
German exports to Malawi totalled around 15.5 million euros in 2015 while German imports from Malawi came to approximately 135 million euros. 
Germany is also helping secure the energy supply of West Africa in general, and Benin in particular, through financial contributions to the West African Power Pool (WAPP) as part of its supraregional engagement. 
A follow-up strategy is to be adopted in the foreseeable future. 
Benin benefits from other transnational German-funded initiatives concerned with environmental protection, climate change adaptation and the preservation of flora and fauna. 
At the most recent biennial intergovernmental negotiations on cooperation in October 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany pledged funds for Malawi totalling 82 million euros; special funds to the tune of 16 million euros have also been set aside as part of the special initiative One World – No Hunger, as well as an additional 10 million euros to improve access to family planning in 2016. As one of the least developed countries (LDC), Malawi exclusively receives grants. 
The development cooperation programme is geared to the Paris Declaration objectives of improving the efficiency of development cooperation, of greater donor harmonisation and partner country responsibility. 
That is why there is structural cooperation with other donors in virtually all programmes. 
The Myths of Malawi exhibition, which was developed in the course of a workshop for Malawian and German artists and which received significant support from the Federal Government, was first showcased in Malawi before touring Germany in 2016, with exhibitions held in Hanover, Berlin (at the Press and Information Office of the Federal Government) and Tübingen. 
In addition, there is regular coordination on the ground among the donors and with the relevant Beninese ministries. 
Discussions are held with Benin’s Government on overriding issues such as good governance and fighting corruption with a view to making cooperation more effective. 
Since 2008, between 15 and 30 young people have regularly been active in various social projects in Benin under the “weltwärts” volunteer programme. 
Numerous initiatives of Germany’s civil society, churches, cities and municipalities are engaged in poverty reduction measures in Benin, some with BMZ support. 
The German political foundations active in Benin (the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, the Hanns Seidel Foundation and the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V.) are held in high regard on account of their programmes to promote democracy and social policy. 
Furthermore, it is helping to provide school meals in order to improve both nutrition and pupils’ successful attendance of lessons at primary schools with daily school lunches. 
We entertain an intensive dialogue with our EU partners, especially our immediate neighbours, on key foreign, security and European policy issues. This dialogue is also intended to facilitate cross-border and regional cooperation, economic exchange and investment, as well as to support exchanges at the level of civil society and enhance youth and student exchanges. 
The European Directorate-General deals with strategic considerations regarding the future of the European Union as an integration project and with key priorities such as deepening economic and monetary union, continuing to enhance the common area of freedom, security and justice, and strengthening the EU as a shaping force in an increasingly globalised world. 
The European Directorate-General plays a leading role in devising, shaping and coordinating the German Government’s policy on Europe. 
The European Directorate-General, together with the Directorate-General for European Policy of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, therefore coordinates instructions for the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) in Brussels, which prepares the meetings of the Council. 
The various divisions within the European Directorate-General are responsible for basic issues, community policy and coordinating EU commissioners in Germany and abroad. 
This includes EU internal affairs such as EU spending policy, as well as fundamental issues of EU external relations (enlargement and neighbourhood policies); relations with the European Parliament and the EU’s human resources and language policy are also part of their remit. 
At just under 18,000 square kilometres, the emirate of Kuwait is around the same size as Land Rhineland-Palatinate.

More small and medium-sized enterprises in the Gulf region 
A large number of German companies have invested in the Gulf state, while many Kuwaiti firms have invested in Germany. 
New Kuwait, an ambitious programme aimed at diversifying the Kuwaiti economy in order to reduce its dependence on oil exports, is currently underway. 
Kuwait country profile 
During his visit on Tuesday (18 April), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed his admiration for the untiring efforts of Kuwaiti diplomats. 
Germany and Kuwait actually have very different social and political structures. 
Following his talks with Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Khalid Alhamad Alsabah, Gabriel said it was “amazing and extremely gratifying” to find that the countries were so united on the situation in Syria. 
However, they agree that there can be no military solution for Syria. 
For this reason, both countries want to continue doing everything in their power to bring all relevant countries, such as the United States, Russia and Syria’s neighbouring states, to talks headed by the United Nations. 
Gabriel in his meeting with Sheikh Sabah Khalid Alhamad Alsabah 
With regard to the crisis in Yemen, Gabriel also spelt out Germany’s support for Kuwait’s endeavours to mediate. 
He expressed his particular admiration for its efforts “as a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council to achieve a new understanding and peaceful coexistence in the difficult relationship with Iran”. 
Kuwait is not only active as a mediator in this context. It also plays a key role in providing humanitarian aid to the suffering Yemeni population. 
With regard to bilateral relations, Gabriel expressed a wish to expand economic cooperation even further. 
Germany is already Kuwait’s undisputed main trading partner in the European Union. 
As a goal for the future, Gabriel also wants to encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in Kuwait in addition to well-known large companies. 
This is also creating valuable opportunities for German suppliers, for example in the renewable energies sector. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the appointment of Achim Steiner as new head of UNDP 
During the last few years, UNDP has done much for international development cooperation. 
Whilst on a trip to Iraq, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (19 April) on the appointment of Achim Steiner as new head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): 
Only if we work together can we master the immense task of improving the quality of life for millions of people around the world, something for which the acronym UNDP stands. 
Gabriel in Kuwait – support for the country’s role as a mediator in the region 
Foreign Minister Gabriel arriving at the airport in Kuwait 
Germany will do everything in its power to support it. 
I am delighted that the United Nations has decided to appoint Achim Steiner to head the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
He proved this in earlier roles within the United Nations system, especially as long-standing head of the United Nations Environment Programme. 
However, major challenges lie ahead, in particular the implementation of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals. 
The volume of trade between Germany and Benin is modest. 
In 2016, Benin’s imports from Germany were worth 43.6 million euros, compared to 77.2 million euros in 2014. 
Given all his experience, his passion for development and his great commitment, Achim Steiner is just the right person to head the UNDP. 
Conversely, Benin’s exports to Germany were worth 1.1 million euros in 2016, compared to 8.4 million euros in 2014 
Federal Statistical Office export report dated 21 March 2017). 
Overall, Benin continues to record a negative trade balance with Germany. 
Germany’s private sector has a majority holding in the local company CIMBENIN through a Norwegian subsidiary of HeidelbergCement. 
The Allianz insurance company has been established in Benin via its French branch since 2009. 
Also, DHL has been operating there since 1984. 
In addition to economic cooperation, there are also lively contacts in the cultural sphere. 
A cultural agreement between Germany and Benin was signed in 1987 and entered into force on 13 May 1988. 
The Goethe-Institut in Abidjan is also responsible for Benin; a GI teaching expert in Lomé (Togo) covers Benin too. 
Deutsche Welle cooperates with Beninese media companies (co-productions and training programmes). 
The German Embassy promotes bilateral cultural relations by arranging scholarships and visiting professorships (the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has a lector and a language assistant working in Benin), by organising German courses, concerts and film screenings, and by donating sports equipment. 
Since 2008, the German Embassy has held German Culture Weeks in Cotonou (most recently in March 2014) and Natitingou (most recently in autumn 2012). 
In addition, Germany occasionally supports Beninese cultural projects. 
The Honme Museum for History and Ethnography in Porto-Novo has been restored with German assistance 
and one of the Royal Palaces of Abomey has been rebuilt with funding from the Cultural Preservation Programme. 
Both projects are designed to help preserve Benin’s cultural heritage.

The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding a research programme that also operates in Benin. 
The WASCAL project (West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) is a BMBF initiative jointly developed by the BMBF, German scientists and researchers and partners from the political and scientific sectors of the participating West African countries. 
WASCAL builds on networks and structures established between 2000 and 2011 as part of the BMBF-funded projects GLOWA Impetus and BIOTA West Africa. 
Of the approximately 21 million euros approved so far for WASCAL, some 1.5 million euros is being made available to Benin to build a graduate school. 
The project (preliminary and main phase) runs from 2010 to 2016.

He was impressed by his interlocutors. 
“There is great optimism,” he said. 
“Iraq has considerable economic potential. 
Otherwise, there would be hardly any international investment. 
The main topic of his talks with members of the Iraqi Government was the comprehensive approach to stabilisation that Germany is pursuing in the country. 
“Tackling IS booby-traps with German assistance” (article of 4 April 2017) 
Following years of conflict, the country on the rivers Euphrates and Tigris needs to find its own ways to carry out the necessary political, economic and social reforms. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to Iraq on Tuesday evening (18 April) to underline how Germany can accompany Iraq on this path. 
With its CrossCulture Programme (CCP), the ifa (Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations) seeks to promote intercultural dialogue with Islamic societies as a partner of the Federal Foreign Office. 
The CCP is geared towards socially engaged individuals aged 23 to 45 working in relevant organisations. 
They are given the opportunity to live, work and study in another cultural environment for two to three months. 
Young professionals and volunteers from Germany, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia get to enhance their professional and social skills and become acquainted with another culture. 
CrossCulture grant recipients have the opportunity to work at a host country organisation during their stay. 
As well as learning on the job, the programme participants gain an insight into the social and political structures in the host country and familiarise themselves with cultural influences and patterns of behaviour. 
They also make important contacts that they can use for future collaboration after returning to their home countries. 
This intercultural exchange also boosts network-building between organisations in Germany and the Islamic world and encourages cross‑border cooperation.

Gabriel’s schedule on Wednesday (19 April) included talks with President Fuad Masoum and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, 
This support went far beyond Germany’s role in the fight against IS. Germany is pursuing a comprehensive approach to stabilisation, which includes 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said that Germany was making a key contribution in this area and had already provided a billion euros in support to Iraq since 2014. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met Monsignor Pius Qasha, Vicar General of the Syrian Catholic archdiocese of St Joseph in Baghdad. 
Gabriel also met representatives of churches and civil society in Baghdad in order to learn more about the conflicts in the country. 
Iraq’s economic development is also an important factor for stabilisation. 
And the reform processes that have been launched are the most important means of reviving this potential.” 
Rebuilding the country – as regards both its economy and society – is thus the main priority. 
“Ultimately, security can only be created if two things happen – IS is defeated and the country is developed, thus creating opportunities. 
As Germans, we are committed to making this happen.” 
It was now important to form a state free of corruption, with a functioning public administration and, above all, a trustworthy and independent judiciary. 
Berlin / Bucharest, 21 April 2017 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (20 April) on the ongoing protests in Venezuela: 
The fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe paved the way for undertaking resolute steps in a spirit of partnership in order to overcome the division of Europe for good. 
We condemn violence as means of political confrontation. 
Our two countries enjoy wide-ranging and close relations 
The Federal Government calls on all parties to refrain from violence. 
based on the solid foundation of our shared cultural heritage and in particular on close interpersonal ties. 
These daily contacts between Romanians and Germans, between people with different identities in both countries, are an impressive illustration of how harmonious and natural coexistence can be in Europe. 
Germany accompanied Romania closely on its path to the European Union. 
Europe is our common future and our essential framework for action. 
The opposition has called for the demonstrations to be continued, 
blaming President Maduro for the country’s economic collapse and accusing him of breaching the constitution. 
To this day, the Treaty lays the foundation for the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries. 
“The Federal Government deplores the fact that there were violent clashes in Venezuela on 19 April during largely peaceful mass protests against the Government that have claimed three further victims. 
Our aim was to create a permanent pan-European peaceful order and to build a common Europe united by human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 
Two demonstrators and a police officer died after sustaining gunshot wounds and around 200 others were injured. 
To this end, we conduct an open, constructive and results-oriented dialogue. 
On 19 April – a public holiday to mark the beginning of the Venezuelan war of independence in 1810 – several hundred thousand people took to the streets across the country to protest against President Maduro and his government. 
Our membership of NATO shows that we are also part of a strong community based on the principle of solidarity as regards common defence and security issues. 
State security forces and paramilitary forces (militia) close to the regime engaged in systematic attempts to disrupt the demonstrations and to break them up with the use of tear gas. 
Sixty years after its foundations were laid by the Treaties of Rome, the EU is currently facing a wide range of challenges, including challenges to cohesion between the Member States themselves. 
Since the beginning of clashes between supporters of the opposition alliance MUD and state security forces approximately two weeks ago, there have been a total of eight fatalities (seven of whom were demonstrators), as well as several hundred injured people and arrests. 
Meanwhile, Maduro has accused the opposition of seeking to stage a coup with the support of the USA. 
In the Palestinian territories, the Federal President will meet with President Mahmoud Abbas and visit a training centre. 
In order to rebuild Iraq, it was vital that the internal reconciliation process make headway and that the country be kept together. 
In his talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, Gabriel stressed Germany’s comprehensive support. 
In the end, the country’s stability will depend on the Government’s planned reforms, which must now be put into practice.”

Together, we want to uphold this historically unique project and to take the challenges of the future into account in it – in the interests of a safe, prosperous, competitive and socially responsible Europe! 
The United Nations General Assembly accordingly adopted the World Programme of Action for Youth (WPAY) in 1995. 
Joint declaration by the Foreign Ministers on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the German-Romanian Treaty on Friendly Cooperation of 21 April 1992 
On 21 April 1992, exactly 25 years ago, representatives of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and Romania signed the Agreement on Friendly Cooperation and Partnership in Europe in Bucharest. 
The German minority in Romania had a significant impact on the country’s history and culture and played a role in the renown that Germany enjoys in Romania. 
At the same time, the many Romanian citizens who live in Germany enrich the close relations between our two countries. 
Friendship and mutual respect in Europe are key elements of our wide-ranging political, economic and civil-society relations, which serve as an example of coexistence and cooperation in Europe. 
These relations provide testimony of the good cooperation between Germany and Romania at governmental, Land and regional level. 
Since Romania’s accession to the European union ten years ago, our two countries have worked closely together with the aim of uniting Europe on the basis of human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law. 
We reaffirm our determination, expressed in the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017, to address these challenges in the spirit of European integration. 
The European Union provides the best framework for ensuring security and prosperity in a sustainable and social Europe that plays a crucial role in the world and helps to shape the ever-closer interconnections between our countries and societies on the basis of our common values. 
We reaffirm our commitment to the European integration project, which is a project of peace, freedom, democracy and the rule of law and has developed into one of the most important economic areas with an unprecedented level of social security. 
The Federal Government urges the Venezuelan Government to make good on its promise given in the context of the international mediation talks held in the autumn of 2016 – releasing political prisoners, acknowledging the rights of the Parliament, establishing a schedule for elections and improving people’s economic and social circumstances – thereby creating the conditions for resuming the national dialogue.” 
The Venezuelan Government has a special responsibility to guarantee the right to peaceful demonstrations and to prevent acts of violence against demonstrators. 
All are obviously very worried that the country is fragmenting into Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. 
Of course, they all also see the disastrous economic situation which is driving many young people out of the country, the young people actually needed for reconstruction. 
They believe too little is being done to promote reconciliation.

Visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories 
Amongst other things, he will visit German-Israeli cooperation projects and hold discussions with civil society representatives and students at The Hebrew University. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement concerning the March for Science, which is scheduled for this Saturday (22 April): 
Updated in 2010, this programme defines priority areas that affect young people the world over. 
It also contains recommendations for action by member states. 
Since the adoption of the WPAY, a World Youth Report has been published every two years as a way of taking stock of the progress which has already been made. 
More information on the United Nations Programme on Youth is available here: 
German youth delegates 
Katharina Buch and Eric Klausch, 2016 youth delegates 
Experience the United Nations in New York first-hand? 
Since 2005, two young people have been given the opportunity to accompany each German delegation to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, 
where, along with other youth delegates from around the world, they observe the work of the General Assembly and provide a voice for the concerns of young people. 
We must stand up and defend ourselves against such developments. 
We need free academic discourse and fact-based scientific data, so that we can shape the world of tomorrow. 
Since 2006, the youth delegates have been able to make a speech to the international community. 
While they accompany the German governmental delegation, they are not bound by the Government’s position and may freely express their own views. 
Before departing for New York, the youth delegates tour Germany for several weeks. 
In Germany, the Alliance of Science Organisations has expressed its support for the March for Science. 
Through talks and projects with other young people in schools and universities, youth organisations and associations as well as independent bodies, they familiarise themselves with the work of the United Nations and decide which topics should be presented in New York. 
The General Assembly deals with youth issues in the Third Committee. 
The World Programme of Action for Youth also falls within the remit of the Commission for Social Development (CSocD), a functional commission of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). 
The project to send German youth delegates to the General Assembly is funded by the United Nations Association of Germany (UNA-Germany) and the German National Committee for International Youth Work (DNK) and is also supported by the Federal Foreign Office as well as the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. 
The application process is run each autumn for the following year; for more information, click here: 
Model United Nations 
Model United Nations (MUN) conferences simulate the meetings and negotiations of UN bodies in essence according to the actual rules of procedure of, for instance, the Security Council or the General Assembly. 
Every participant represents the interests of one member state. 
The aim of MUN conferences is to demonstrate to those participating the challenges that diplomats face in negotiations. 
They illustrate why consensus is often so elusive in the UN system. 
Every year, many young people take part in local, national and international MUN conferences in Germany. 
One of the largest simulations is the National Model United Nations Conference (NMUN), which takes place annually in New York. 
Universities from around the world send delegations to the NMUN. 
It therefore worries me that scientific freedom is coming under increasing pressure, also in Europe. 
In many cities in Germany and around the world, people will take to the streets tomorrow as a visible sign of support for the freedom of science. 
Germany has good reason to get involved: as a high-tech country, it owes its global network to a highly innovative research landscape that includes universities, institutes of applied science, research companies and science organisations. 
UNYA Germany 
The United Nations Youth Association Germany (UNYA Germany) brings together more than 35 groups of young people interested in the United Nations from all over Germany. 
They variously focus on research and teaching as well as youth participation in the UN and on Germany’s network of MUN initiatives. 
They collaborate in working groups which are given remits during Assemblies of Delegates to work either on specific projects (such as preparing for a particular event) or towards more long-term goals (such as exchange between Germany’s MUN groups). 
Further information is available on the Association’s website: 
In the context of its cultural relations and education policy, Germany campaigns for the freedom of science around the world. It maintains scientific cooperation also when political conditions are difficult, so that students and junior researchers continue to have access to the European area of knowledge and values. 
When academics lose their jobs for political reasons, universities are sidelined, and certain areas of research are substantially weakened, it is also our democratic principles that come under attack. 
Through the Philipp Schwartz Initiative of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, threatened scientists from around the world are given the opportunity to pursue their research in Germany. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the March for Science on 22 April 2017 
The March for Science is an initiative of United States scientists and researchers and is being held for the first time on 22 April 2017. 
Demonstrations will take place around the world, with the aim of underscoring the significance of science and scientific freedom. 
Independent research and teachers’ academic freedom are pillars of an open and modern society. 
Each year, the Federal Foreign Office welcomes groups from German universities who have come to Berlin specifically to prepare for the NMUN in New York. 
Moreover, since 2012 the CrossCulture Plus module has helped to promote small‑scale projects by CrossCulture alumni in Arab transition countries. These initiatives seek to strengthen civil society structures in the region. 
Ahead of his departure for Jordan around midday (23 April), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the death of an OSCE observer in eastern Ukraine 
The Federal Chancellor’s G8 Personal Representative for Africa, Günter Nooke, visited Benin in February 2011, December 2012 and July 2013. Benin’s Foreign Minister Nassirou Bako-Arifari was in Berlin in March 2012 and again in May 2014. 
Former Federal President Köhler paid another visit to Benin in May 2012. 
The Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Dr Gerd Müller, visited Benin on 2 and 3 January 2016.

Here, too, the focus was on rebuilding the country. 
Minister of State Böhmer on UNESCO World Book Day 
On the occasion of the UNESCO World Book and Copyright Day (23 April), Minister of State Maria Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, issued the following statement: 
“That is a relatively small amount compared with what it means when people can simply return to their fields.” 
The aim is to encourage children and young people in particular to develop a passion for reading. 
“Improving living conditions is the best way to combat ideologies founded on hatred.” 
Access to books always also means access to education and culture. 
That is a crucial requirement for successful integration into our society and for social participation. 
World Book Day aims to raise awareness of this problem and draw attention to it. 
What we have feared for years has now happened: 
I am deeply shocked by the news from eastern Ukraine. 
The death of an OSCE observer and the injuries suffered by two others near Luhansk today is a terrible tragedy. 
Someone who only wanted to help bring about peace and end the fighting lost their life today. 
Our condolences and heartfelt sympathy are with the families of the victims, their friends and colleagues. 
“When you come from a peaceful country, it a really shocking sight,” Gabriel said. 
I wish the injured observers a speedy recovery. 
He also visited a 50-kilometre strip of mines used by IS to secure its territory. 
A visit to a camp for internally displaced persons highlighted how important it is to create opportunities for people in the region. 
Our wholehearted solidarity is with Ambassador Apakan and his great team. 
The OSCE observers show untiring commitment and do outstanding work day after day. 
The intolerable attacks and unjustifiable accusations, especially on the part of the separatists, must stop. 
Open and unhindered access to books, cultural works and information is essential for people to be able to develop an informed opinion and to express their views freely. 
In many countries in crisis and conflict regions, access to books remains a privilege reserved for the few. 
It is in the interest of everyone, particularly the parties to the conflict at the line of contact, that the OSCE observers are able to do their important and indispensable, and at the same time difficult and dangerous, work. 
In view of the comprehensive commitment to education in the fourth goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must not relax our efforts in Germany and throughout the world, but continue to do everything in our power to drive forward initiatives to promote reading. 
It is thanks to them that in the last few years the military escalation in eastern Ukraine has not been greater. 
many publishing houses, foundations, libraries and schools are holding book-related events. 
In Germany, UNESCO World Book Day on 23 April is being celebrated with a large-scale reading extravaganza: 
Situated15 kilometres from the IS stronghold of Mosul, scarcely a single building in the town has escaped damage, and every third building has been completely destroyed. 
In Bashiqa, which was captured by IS in 2014 but has now been liberated by the Peshmerga, Foreign Minister Gabriel said that Germany would provide generators, water tanks and clearance vehicles worth over a million euros. 
After his visit, Gabriel said that far more than the 15 million euros provided to date would be needed to support the landmine-clearance project. 
We have the results from France, and naturally I am pleased that Emmanuel Macron has come out in front. 
He got the biggest vote and will now go forward to the second round. 
And I am sure that he will be France’s new President. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on elections in France 
In France they think about France, of course, but also about Europe. 
And I am particularly happy that Emmanuel Macron won this round because he was the only truly pro-European candidate who did not hide behind prejudices about Europe, who took a clear line, and who stands for a new start in France and in Europe. 
I think we can be pleased about this result, and I am confident that in the second round he will see off right-wing radicalism and right-wing populism, as well as the anti-Europeans. 
I personally will at any rate do all I can to continue to support him. 
He is a great presidential candidate. He will be an excellent President. And he is also, by the way, a really nice person and a good friend. 
Visit to Jordan: 
recognition and support for hosting Syrian refugees 
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is going to unimaginable lengths in its efforts to host refugees from the region. 
Today, Israel remembers those who died in the Shoah, six million Jews who were murdered by the National Socialists in an unparalleled crime against humanity. 
The country’s 6.5 million inhabitants share their country, 80 percent of which consists of desert, with around three million refugees and guest workers. 
Bild: Denkmal … 
Memorial and name 
Monthly per capita income in Jordan is barely 500 US dollars. 
For our generation it is both a warning and an obligation – to take a stand against anti‑Semitism and for human dignity, tolerance and intercultural understanding. 
Jordan has been a host country for Palestinian refugees since as long ago as 1947. 
Education and employment for refugees 
The country is therefore facing major challenges – and Germany stands firmly at Jordan’s side in its efforts to overcome them. 
The name stands for the six million Jews who were murdered under National Socialism. 
Symbol of reconciliation 
It stands for the reconciliation between Israel and Germany. 
The programme Jordan Compact, which has facilitated access to the labour market and education for Syrian refugees in Jordan, was adopted at this conference. 
At the same time, the visit underlines that Germany continues to face up to its dark past in a spirit of profound humility to this day. 
Focus on education 
Germany considers it to be particularly important for Syrian refugees to be able to attend schools and universities in Jordan. 
The visit to Yad Vashem is Foreign Minister Gabriel’s only official appointment in Israel on this day. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in Israel 
Alongside computer engineering, the degree courses include social work in the field of displacement and migration. 
On this occasion I want to reiterate in no uncertain terms the historic responsibility that Germany bears for the Holocaust and the crimes of the Second World War and that guides our conduct today. 
That is the task for which we will one day be called to account. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in Yad Vashem to mark Yom Hashoah 
On this day and in this place, the shadows of history are darker than anywhere else. 
Yom Hashoah, Israel’s Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day, starts with a memorial ceremony in the morning. 
The invitation of a German Foreign Minister to Yad Vashem on this day is highly symbolic. 
Standing up for Israel’s security and well-being thus remains an inviolable cornerstone of German foreign policy. 
Visit continues on 25 April 
Yom Hashoah is based on the Jewish calendar and usually falls on 27 Nisan. In 2017, this corresponds to 24 April in the Gregorian calendar.

The African Union

The African Union (AU) was founded in 2002 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity. 
According to its founding charter, the AU mandate encompasses all fields of political, economic and social co-existence. 
The AU has 55 members, meaning all countries of the African continent are represented. 
Organisational structure 
The most important organs of the AU are as follows: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Jordan on Sunday (23 April) with a clear message, 
namely that the remarkable efforts by Syria’s neighbouring countries would not be forgotten. 
Despite this, the country has taken in people in need from the region time and again since gaining independence in 1946.

The establishment of the AU in 2002 laid the foundations of a peace and security architecture for the whole continent (APSA: African Peace and Security Architecture). 
With it came the understanding that the Africans and their regional organisations should take increased responsibility for peace and security on the continent. 
Jordan is enjoying international support and trade facilitation in return. 
The Federal Foreign Office is helping to fund 90 scholarships for Master’s students at the German Jordanian University, for example.

The African Standby Force (ASF) will provide the central pillar of the architecture in future. A framework concept was agreed in 2004. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visited a community centre for refugees in the Jordanian capital Amman and held political talks with Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki as well as with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. 
In order to do justice to the growing significance of Africa for Europe, the first EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in 2007 adopted the Joint EU-Africa Strategy and Action Plan, which were then reaffirmed at the second Summit in 2010. 
The Strategy placed the relationship between the neighbouring continents on a new footing and extends beyond development issues. 
Pan-African University 
Other objectives are closer cooperation among scientists and researchers, greater mobility for African students and also the establishment of a regional and continental platform for scientific cooperation. 
This was not least apparent at the 2016 London donors’ conference Supporting Syria, at which Germany as a co-host made the largest individual pledge to the tune of 2.3 billion euros. 
Having contributed 145 million euros to date, it is one of the largest donors in this domain. 
We must support the country’s efforts!” The German Foreign Minister said that, as one of the world’s biggest donors of humanitarian assistance, Germany would be unwavering in its support. Gabriel left Amman for Israel on Monday. 
Today (24 April), upon his arrival in Israel, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement: 
Here in Israel today, I bow my head in silence before the unfathomable depths, the almost inconceivable betrayal of all civilised values that was the Shoah, and before the country that has, despite this, extended its hand to us Germans. 
“Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.” (Book of Isaiah, 56:5). The name Yad Vashem is derived from this verse, that is, from “Yad”, the Hebrew for “place”, and “shem”, the Hebrew for “name”. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is visiting Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in Jerusalem on Yom Hashoah, Israel’s Holocaust Rembrance Day. 
He will continue his trip on 25 April, when he will hold talks with members of the Israeli Government, as well as representatives of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. 
Opening of the German-Georgian Year – Foreign Minister Gabriel meets Georgian Foreign Minister Janelidze 
On Wednesday (26 April), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will meet his Georgian counterpart Mikheil Janelidze at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Afterwards the two Foreign Ministers will open the German-Georgian Year in the Weltsaal of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Musical entertainment will be provided by the Georgian vocal ensemble Suliko. 
A place of refuge for people in need 
Up to 1.3 million more refugees have been taken in by Jordan in the wake of the bloody conflict in neighbouring Syria. 
An estimated 300,000 Iraqis have found a safe haven in the country. 
The German-Georgian Year will culminate with the 2018 Frankfurt Book Fair where Georgia will be Guest of Honour. 
On Wednesday (26 April), Foreign Minister Gabriel is to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang at Villa Borsig as part of the strategic dialogue on foreign and security policy between China and Germany. 
The two Foreign Ministers Gabriel and Janelidze will be the patrons of the anniversary events.

Human Rights Commissioner on persecution of LGBTI persons in Russia 
Bärbel Kofler, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement today (24 April) on reports regarding persecution of LGBTI persons in Russia: 
I take reports regarding persecution of LGBTI persons in the autonomous Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation very seriously. 
I support the demand that has been made by Gernot Erler, the Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries. 
I regret this all the more because the human rights situation throughout the Russian Federation has deteriorated. 
This has particularly affected minorities, which include LGBTI persons. 
What is also intolerable is that those who report on human rights violations are themselves targeted. 
In Russia, time and again journalists are attacked and killed. 
The journalist Elena Milashina, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who has covered the persecution of LGBTI persons in Chechnya, is currently in hiding at an undisclosed location. 
What is more, these individuals can apparently also not escape persecution by going to other parts of Russia. 
The reports shine a light on an intolerable situation. 
He has called on the Russian government to investigate these reports and to immediately provide the individuals concerned with the support they need. 
The statements that have been issued by the Russian side so far do not suggest that this matter is being followed up on with the dedication it deserves. 
Their talks will focus on bilateral relations and the recent introduction of visa‑free travel to the Schengen area for Georgian citizens. 
The speeches by the two Foreign Ministers will be followed by a German-Georgian dialogue with the author Nino Haratischwili, Vice‑President of the Frankfurt Book Fair Tobias Voss and the football player Levan Kobiashvili. 
The German-Georgian Year is taking place in 2017 to mark the 200th anniversary of the emigration of Swabian Pietists to Georgia and the 25th anniversary of the re‑establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Georgia. 
Alongside Sino‑German relations, the talks are to focus on economic questions and issues currently dominating international politics, for example the tense situation on the Korean peninsula.

President (since 2017: Moussa Faki Mahamat) and eight Commissioners elected by the AU Assembly every four years. 
The Federal Foreign Office is supporting the development of APSA by, amongst other things, helping to develop the police component of the ASF and construct a building for the Department for Peace and Security of the AU Commission in Addis Ababa. 
At the fourth EU-Africa Summit held in Brussels in April 2014 it was agreed that five (broad) priorities would be the focus of continent-to-continent cooperation: 
peace and security; 
democracy, good governance and human rights; 
human development; 
sustainable and inclusive development and growth, as well as continental integration; 
The African Union began to build the Pan-African University (PAU) in 2008. 
The aim is to promote science and technology on the African continent, coordinate research and development and improve general and vocational education. 
There are institutes on key issues affecting the future with different faculties in four sites in North, West, East and Central Africa. 
The establishment of a fifth institute in South Africa is being prepared. 
In Algeria (Tlemcen) the Pan African University Institute for Water and Energy Sciences including Climate Change, of which Germany has agreed to be patron, is being set up. 
Human Rights Commissioner on two executions in the State of Arkansas 
In the United States these issues are the subject of active civil society debate. 
Many people, including relatives of victims, are engaged in work to abolish capital punishment. 
I think of the victims of the crimes and the suffering inflicted on them, their families and friends, 
and I offer them my heartfelt sympathy. 
Nonetheless, the primary focus of government activity should always be the protection of life – the life of every individual, including the perpetrators. 
I would like to convey to them my particular respect. 
In response to the most recent executions in the State of Arkansas, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, issued the following statement today (25 April): 
I am concerned and saddened that two further executions out of the eight that were originally planned for April have now been carried out in Arkansas. 
The death penalty is an inhumane and cruel punishment – as was also demonstrated by the vacillation in the run‑up to these executions which must have been psychologically extremely testing for all concerned. 
For me, trials based on the rule of law which end with the deliberate execution of an individual are not acceptable. 
The BMZ’s special initiative One World, No Hunger, which was launched in 2015 and in which Benin is a major participant, underlines the importance the two Governments attach to fighting hunger. 
The Foreign Minister began his first official visit to Israel by laying a wreath for the six million murdered Jews. He acknowledged Germany’s responsibility for the Holocaust and the crimes of the Second World War, saying 
“for our generation it is both a warning and an obligation – to take a stand against anti‑Semitism and for human dignity, tolerance and intercultural understanding”. 
In the guest book, he wrote: 
His visit continues on 25 April. 
In particular, the AU is intended to advance economic and political integration, safeguard peace and security, foster sustainable development and promote democracy, human rights and good governance in Africa. 
It is furthermore authorised to speak on behalf of Africa at a global level and also to coordinate the activities of Africa’s regional organisations.

The AU is duty bound to intervene in severe cases of human rights abuse or when there is a threat of genocide. 
It is also committed to the principle of ostracising regimes that have assumed power in violation of a country’s constitution and imposing sanctions on them. 
As a collective security and early warning system (in line with Chapter VIII of the UN Charter), ASPA is intended to facilitate prompt and effective responses to crises and conflict situations. 
Its central organ is the Peace and Security Council (PSC). 
The Council is supported by a Military Staff and a “Panel of the Wise”, whose function is to offer mediation. 
The Department for Peace and Security of the AU Commission combines the functions of executive and secretariat. 
A Pan-African Early Warning Unit is also attached to the Department to steer ongoing AU peacekeeping operations. 
The AU began with a peacekeeping force in Burundi (AMIB) back in 2003, followed by the AMIS mission in Darfur (now UNAMID), AMISOM in Somalia and MISCA in the Central African Republic. 
The peace talks for Yemen led by the United Nations in Kuwait ended on 6 August after three and a half months without agreement being reached. Fighting has increased again since then. 
Federal Chancellor Merkel at the G20 summit in Hangzhou 
These missions are not yet based on the idea of a standby force, but depend on voluntary undertakings by the troop-contributing nations. 
EU-AU relations 
The EU is the AU’s most important partner with regard to financial support and capacity-building. 
The Commissions of both organisations work closely together and meet on a regular basis. 
The EU is also the key partner for the development of an African peace and security architecture. 
The next EU-Africa Summit will take place in Abidjan/Côte d’Ivoire at the end of November 2017. 
“Here, more than anywhere else, we are starkly reminded of what evil people are capable of and of the incomparable suffering that has been caused. 
Our task now is to show what good we are also capable of as people when we remind ourselves every day that we are human beings.” 
Naturally, they include Israeli citizens critical of the Government. 
Indeed, they were once included on the Federal President’s guest list, which is why we were quite surprised. 
As Angela Merkel once said, the security of Israel as a democratic, Jewish state is part of Germany’s raison d’état. 
However, my relationship with Israel, and Germany’s relations with Israel, won’t change in any way now. Our two countries cooperate closely. 
Although the current situation is regrettable, it won’t affect our actions. 
“I’ve been here many times and have always met the Prime Minister. Netanyahu and I have actually always had a very open and frank relationship, so I was surprised when the visit was cancelled. 
Evidently it was because we’re going to do something which is quite usual during such visits, namely talk to representatives of civil society. 
The German Embassy has always invited them in the past and there have never been any problems. 
I very much regret this. However, I also want to say in all frankness that I think we should not be a pawn in Israeli domestic politics. 
There will be another opportunity to meet somewhere. 
For I don’t think this is a major disaster. When we visit we have to know that there may be surprises in store. 
Let’s see what happens the next time we meet.” 
From Jerusalem to Ramallah: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visits the Middle East 
Although Sigmar Gabriel has visited Israel countless times, this was his first official visit as Foreign Minister. 
He arrived in Israel on Yom Hashoah, Israel’s Holocaust Rembrance Day. 
On this special day, his itinerary included only one official stop: 
a visit to Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. 
On arriving in Jerusalem, he gave the following statement: 
Gabriel meets with Palestinian Prime Minister Hamdallah 
On the second day of his visit, Foreign Minister Gabriel held talks with representatives of both sides. These discussions centred on the conflict in the Middle East. 
Make good use of the time that is available 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Israeli President Rivlin 
The day also brought a surprising change of plans: 
A meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who also holds the office of Israeli Foreign Minister, was cancelled on short notice. This apparently occurred in connection with a planned meeting of Gabriel with organisations that have expressed criticism of the government. 
Although the German Foreign Minister regrets this decision, he does not consider it to be “a catastrophe”. 
Gabriel is sure that 
“this will not change a thing with regard to German-Israeli relations”. 
He has often met with Netanyahu, and now he will wait until a new opportunity for a meeting arises. 
Toward the end of his visit, Foreign Minister Gabriel was received by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, with whom he held a long and warm discussion. 
He landed back in Berlin in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Palestinian territories 
For this purpose, he held talks with, among others, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah. 
A two-state solution is in the interest of both sides 
After meeting with Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in the West Bank, he re-emphasised that, in the long term, there is no alternative to the two-state solution. 
This is, he stressed, not only in the interest of the Palestinians, but will help to ensure the security of the State of Israel. 
He went on to insist that the Palestinian side should make good use of the time it has right now, before further progress can be made on the Middle East conflict. 
Gabriel saw a particularly pressing need for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to reconcile their differences. 
Other priorities are the holding of elections and improving living conditions for people in the Gaza Strip, to prevent further radicalisation. 
Surprise cancellation 
On the last day of his trip to the Middle East, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel spoke with Israelis and Palestinians, campaigning for a two-state solution as the only exit from the Middle East conflict. 
The situation is becoming increasingly precarious. 
A donor conference took place in Geneva yesterday. 
The situation in Yemen is becoming increasingly precarious. 
At the invitation of the United Nations, Switzerland and Sweden, a donor conference took place in Geneva yesterday. 
StS Lindner…. 
The ministry has a peace mediation team and supports over 40 mediation projects worldwide. 
The aim of the conference was to mobilise more international humanitarian assistance and to draw attention to the dramatic situation in Yemen. 
Relations that are timeless: 
opening of the German-Georgian year 
Wonderful events sometimes last a little longer. 
No two conflicts are alike, and there is no single way to resolve them. 
When there is a need to resolve conflicts and, above all, to achieve lasting peace, the Federal Foreign Office also uses mediation as a tried-and-tested instrument. 
Sino-German strategic dialogue in Berlin: 
In this work, it is vital to get civil society on board, as this is the only way to find the necessary leverage to resolve conflicts. 
Working closely together for peace 
State Secretary Lindner and Secretary General Zucconi signed the joint declaration of intent today (26 April). 
Foreign and security policy issues, above all North Korea’s nuclear programme, were on the agenda. 
In many countries, it has its own access to parties to the conflict, thus complementing the diplomatic channels available to the Federal Foreign Office and the German embassies. 
Germany’s representative at the conference, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, said at the outset: 
The opening event took place in Berlin on Wednesday (26 April). 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his Georgian counterpart Mikheil Janelidze 
“In view of the looming food crisis in Yemen and the humanitarian situation, which has been rapidly deteriorating ever since the start of the war two years ago, this donor conference is taking place at the right time!” 
Hundreds of thousands of children malnourished 
This play on words alone reminds us that 
I warmly congratulate the OPCW on its 20th anniversary. 
Excellent relations 
Yemen is currently the site of one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. 
The two Foreign Ministers, who had met for bilateral talks prior to the event, have assumed the patronage for the German-Georgian year. 
Over 130 joint events and projects are planned in both countries within this framework over the coming 18 months. 
“This is a testament to the richness and diversity of our relations. 
As the guardian of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which almost all nations have joined, it has made the world a safer place through its activities during the last 20 years. 
The vast majority of chemical weapons in the world have already been destroyed under OPCW supervision. 
Since the start of the conflict in March 2015, just under two million Yemenites have been displaced and are living in precarious conditions in collective accommodation centres. 
Around 460,000 children are already severely malnourished, while 17 million Yemenites are affected by food insecurity. 
This time the dialogue focused above all on North Korea’s missile programme and the key question of how to stop North Korea from continuing with its nuclear programme in contravention of various international treaties. 
Both Ministers agreed that 
a sustainable and enduring solution to the conflict could not be achieved solely by means of sanctions, but only in combination with negotiations. 
Gabriel commented as follows: 
She went on to say that 50 million euros would be made available for humanitarian assistance in Yemen in 2017 as well as 55 million euros for development cooperation. 
The strategic focuses of Germany’s humanitarian assistance in Yemen are food, health care, water supply, sanitation and hygiene, as well as protective measures. 
At the same time, the cruel use of chemical weapons against the civilian population in Syria shows that the remaining chemical weapons can still inflict great suffering. 
However, the humanitarian appeal issued by the United Nations for Yemen has produced a mere 15 percent of the funding required so far. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the anniversary of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
That is a great success, and the organisation has rightfully been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this accomplishment. 
We continue to fully support the OPCW and its Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü in their efforts to investigate the most recent chemical weapons attacks in Syria, as they work toward a world free of chemical weapons. 
“We are very glad that China is also of the opinion that this nuclear programme has to be stopped and that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula has to be undertaken step by step.” 
Step by step – 
economic relations in a spirit of partnership 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi outside the Villa Borsig 
The talks also focused on trade relations between Germany and China. 
Working worldwide for peace – Federal Foreign Office and Community of Sant’Egidio consolidate their cooperation 
The Federal Foreign Office and the Community of Sant’Egidio are reinforcing their close cooperation on peace through a joint declaration of intent. 
The Community of Sant’Egidio has supported peace mediation initiatives for 30 years. Since its foundation in Rome in 1968, it has grown to around 60,000 members in over 70 countries. 
In signing a declaration of intent on cooperation between the Federal Foreign Office and the Community of Sant’Egidio today, State Secretary Walter Lindner and Cesare Zucconi, Secretary General of the Community of Sant’Egidio, are reinforcing the close cooperation on peace. 
Gabriel noted that “China has to open its markets step by step,” but also stated that both sides were in agreement on “the need for a partnership whereby the same conditions apply to Chinese businesses in Germany and Europe as to German businesses in China.” 
He noted that there were still a considerable number of hurdles to be crossed before this aim was reached, but underscored that it was a common goal being pursued by both countries in cooperation. 
More exchange between Germany and China 
The bilateral talks also addressed relations as they concern exchange between civil society groups such as 
citizens, school pupils and students. 
We are “inheriting” an extremely vibrant Georgian-German future!” said Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
We are celebrating the German-Georgian year in both countries with a broad range of topics, from culture to civil society, under the heading “Inheriting the future”. 
The existing German-Chinese youth exchange programmes will also continue to receive support. 
Bilateral relations between Germany and China 
I call on the few countries that have not yet signed the Chemical Weapons Convention to do so as soon as possible. This way, the Convention can become universally applicable, and the remaining chemical weapons will soon be found only in history books. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (26 April) to mark the 20th anniversary of the The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW):

Some 18.8 million people – of which 9.6 million are children – are dependent on humanitarian assistance. 
The country is facing a disastrous famine. 
Some 4.5 million people urgently need help to prevent or treat severe malnourishment. 
As food and medicine are either virtually impossible to find or extremely expensive, the alarming number of people suffering malnourishment is continuing to grow. 
100 million euros from Germany 
At the donor conference, Bärbel Kofler announced Germany’s intention to make a substantial contribution towards the urgently needed humanitarian assistance as well as funding for long‑term development cooperation in Yemen. 
The project funding will be based on the “whole‑of‑Yemen” approach and prioritise regions with a large share of internally displaced persons, as well as neighbouring countries which have taken in refugees from Yemen. 
The two countries are planning to conclude an internship agreement, which should enable young people from Germany and China to experience life in the other country as soon as possible. 
This is why the German-Georgian year is longer than 12 months, namely 18 – 
from April 2017 to its climax in October 2018, when Georgia will be the Guest of Honour of the world’s largest book fair in Frankfurt. 
These occasions are therefore a journey through the history of our countries – with the two hundredth anniversary of the arrival of German settlers in the Southern Caucasus on the one hand and the 25th anniversary of the re‑establishment of diplomatic relations on the other. 
“The excellent German-Georgian relations are simply timeless!” quipped Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the opening event in the Weltsaal of the Federal Foreign Office, which was also attended by his counterpart Mikheil Janelidze. 
He noted that in times of upheaval both sides had a particularly great interest in strengthening multilateral crisis management processes. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi today (26 April) for extensive consultations. The two men met for the first time at the G20 meeting in Bonn this February. 
When it came to international affairs, Germany and China had many interests in common, Foreign Minister Gabriel said upon meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at the Villa Borsig in Tegel, Berlin. 
Federal President Steinmeier travels to Italy 
In Italy, he and President Sergio Mattarella will visit the Ardeatine Caves site. 
The schedule also includes a meeting with Prime Minister Gentiloni. 
This will be followed by talks, a joint press conference and lunch with the Italian President. 
In the afternoon, Federal President Steinmeier will join students at Sapienza University of Rome for a discussion about Europe. 
From 3 to 4 May 2017, Frank-Walter Steinmeier will make his first official trip to the Italian Republic as Federal President.

Germany has the capacity to make an important contribution to this discourse with its history of division and reunification. 
The German-Korean advisory board on foreign policy issues relating to reunification presented its final report at the Federal Foreign Office today (28 April) following its fifth working session. 
On Friday morning, State Secretary Markus Ederer received the report with recommendations for the two governments on behalf of the Federal Government. 
Ederer said that a board such as this was urgently needed against the backdrop of the current situation on the Korean Peninsula and could help to continue to reinforce the strategic partnership with the Republic of Korea. 
State Secretary Ederer said that he was confident that the Federal Foreign Office would soon commence talks with the Government of the Republic of Korea, which is to be elected on 9 May, on devising a new forward-looking consultation mechanism on current security policy issues in the East Asia region. 
The report is the product of extensive consultations between German and Korean foreign policy experts in recent years. 
“German-Korean advisory board recommends expanding bilateral dialogue on security policy” 
One of the key recommendations of the report is to continue the joint dialogue regarding current security issues on the Korean Peninsula. 
Both sides have held very frank discussions on strategies for the Korean Peninsula during this period. 
The advisory board was established by the Foreign Ministeries of Germany and South Korea in 2014. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the events in Skopje 
A government must now finally be formed in Skopje, to fulfil the mandate of the democratic elections that were held in December. 
“Talat Xhaferi is the constitutionally elected speaker of parliament. 
We expect the government to maintain law and order in the country. 
This clear message from the German Government was today conveyed to the Ambassador of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia when he was summoned to the Federal Foreign Office.” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel commented as follows today (28 April) on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson added the following statement: 
This result – along with the outcome of the parliamentary elections – must also be respected by his opponents. 
“The events in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the parliament building was stormed yesterday and legislators were beaten before the eyes of security personnel, are not in keeping with what we in the EU expect from a candidate for EU membership. 
The responsible officials in Skopje should turn their professed commitment to Europe into deeds, accept the outcome of the election and allow it to be implemented. 
It is simply unacceptable that the previous ruling party has refused to allow this to happen, and that its supporters are storming parliament and beating legislators.” 
Thank you very much for this invitation. 
Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the missile test in North Korea 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (29 April) on the most recent missile test in North Korea: 
Commenting on reports about the imminent execution of the young Iranian Peyman Barandah, Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (28 April): 
Peyman Barandah was only 15 years old at the time of the crime he is accused of having committed. 
This morning, North Korea once again attempted to launch a ballistic missile in spite of clear warnings from the international community. 
Although this test was evidently unsuccessful, it represents a clear breach of international law. 
Gabriel advocates critical dialogue with Turkey 
Should Peyman Barandah be executed, it would be an unacceptable violation of international law. 
I strongly urge the Iranian judicial authorities not to carry out the planned execution and to give Peyman Barandah a fair trial and due process – without applying the death penalty. 
We condemn this renewed breach of international law in the strongest possible terms and call upon the regime in North Korea to return to international norms. 
Peyman Barandah was arrested in 2010 at the age of 15. 
AM Gabriel … Statement… 
Foreign Minister Gabriel gives a statement on the fringes of the meeting. 
At the same time it is clear that this conflict cannot be contained and ultimately resolved by military means, but only through diplomatic channels. 
To conduct critical dialogue with Turkey at an even more intensive level, cooperation between the EU and Turkey has to be placed on a new footing, as Gabriel underscored. 
Not disappointing democrats in Turkey 
AM mit Mogherini und … 
Many observers are concerned by political developments in Turkey. 
Yet there are also strong pro-European forces in the country. 
For him, isolating Turkey in terms of foreign policy would not help anyone. 
Both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – both of which have been ratified by Iran – prohibit the execution of individuals who were minors at the time the crime was committed. 
After his arrest he was kept in solitary confinement for three months and allegedly tortured. 
In Italy, he and President Sergio Mattarella will visit the Ardeatine Caves site. 
He did not meet his lawyer before the start of his trial. 
This will be followed by talks and lunch with the Italian President. 
Federal President Steinmeier will join students at Sapienza University of Rome for a discussion about Europe. 
Flight to Rome 
One way of doing this would be by easing travel restrictions for democratic activists or journalists.

As the Minister pointed out, the EU needs to help the countries more to avert both internal and external crises. 
Gabriel described the current crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as incompatible with European expectations. 
Three applications for a new trial due to changes to Iranian juvenile criminal law have been rejected without any reasons being stated. 
Yesterday’s high‑level meeting of the UN Security Council emphasised that the international community is united and determined to take a joint stand against the threat posed by the North Korean nuclear weapon and missile programme – and is prepared to use additional pressure if North Korea does not finally take steps to de‑escalate the situation. 
North Korea’s aggressive collision course and its violation of UN Security Council resolutions are jeopardising the peace and security of its neighbours and the entire region. 
Gabriel in Somalia: 
I am extremely concerned about the imminent execution of the young Iranian Peyman Barandah scheduled for 10 May 2017. 
Since 2016, three applications for a new trial due to changes to Iranian juvenile criminal law have been rejected without any reasons being stated.

However, we shouldn’t forget the others. 
Neither in Turkey nor elsewhere. 
The latest figures from Reporters without Borders show how dramatic the situation is. 
In 2017 alone, eight journalists have been killed. 
G20 in Hamburg: 
I didn’t escalate anything at all, 
either I call off my talks with Israeli civil society organisations critical of the government, or he won’t meet me. 
It’s just an excuse. 
I have a particular connection to this memorial day on account of my family history. 
And there’s no other country on Earth that I have visited more often than Israel. 
Standing up for Israel shouldn’t be synonymous with ignoring the rights of Palestinians, for example. 
How is the EU going to approach Turkey now? 
That is what the EU Foreign Ministers were discussing today in Valletta. 
That is what the EU Foreign Ministers are discussing today in the Maltese capital, Valletta. 
For Foreign Minister Gabriel, the main question is how the EU can promote democracy in Turkey. 
At the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Malta, Gabriel spoke out against halting EU accession negotiations with Turkey. 
“Pushing Turkey towards Russia” could not be in Europe's interest, as Gabriel made clear. 
Now that Turkey has decided to restructure its political system in a constitutional referendum, the EU faces the question of how to continue relations with its neighbour on the Bosphorus. 
Turkey has been an EU accession candidate since 2005. 
Talking to his EU colleagues, Gabriel advocated seeking formats for talks which are separate from the accession process. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with Federica Mogherini and the Maltese Foreign Minister Vella 
The constitutional referendum on introducing a presidential system was only won by a narrow majority. 
For the people in Turkey working to promote European values in their country, a suspension of the EU accession negotiations would be a devastating signal, as Gabriel pointed out. 
Instead, as the Minister stressed, it is a matter now of strengthening the democratic forces in Turkey. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his EU colleagues 
In Valletta, the EU Foreign Ministers will today also talk about the EU's global strategy. 
“It is simply unacceptable that the previous ruling party has refused [to respect the democratic mandate] and that its supporters are storming parliament and beating legislators,” as Gabriel stated. 
Germany’s position with respect to Israel’s settlement activities is well known. 
We aren’t the only country to take this view. 
The fact that I meet critics of the Israeli Government to discuss this important topic is neither improper, nor is it unusual or surprising. 
From 3 to 4 May, Frank-Walter Steinmeier will make his first official trip to the Italian Republic as Federal President. 
Talks will also be held with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and former President Giorgio Napolitano. 
Talks with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni 
The international community must not look the other way 
Yesterday (1 May), Sigmar Gabriel became the first German Foreign Minister to travel to Somalia. 
I’m sure that our good and close relationship with Israel won’t change. 
Has the threat that Donald Trump poses also been exaggerated? 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met with Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire. 
On Monday, Foreign Minister Gabriel became the first German politician in several decades to visit Somalia. 
Gabriel’s visit took him to the capital Mogadishu and to a refugee camp near Baidoa in the south-west of the country. 
Somalia has been wracked by decades of civil war and terrorism and is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 
Appeal to the international community 
Long periods of drought and drawn-out violent conflicts have again brought the threat of famine to the Horn of Africa. 
For weeks now, Germany has been working to mobilise international aid. 
That doesn’t mean that all is now well, however. 
DEU, neu: 
The programme covers a wide range of activities including: 
And it still seems strange to me how, for example, his daughter’s visit to Germany was lauded almost as if it were a society event, even though combining politics with family and business interests smacks of nepotism and would be unthinkable in this country. 
Germany doubles its aid 
Nevertheless, I have the impression that US President Trump has now got a better handle on the day-to-day business of government and listens to advisers who are more rational and realistic... 
Somalia is particularly affected by the threat of famine.

where tens of thousands of families live in makeshift shelters. 
There is no medical care. 
“The situation here is disastrous,” Gabriel said, “what we urgently need is more international aid.” 
Germany will double its aid for Somalia, which currently stands at 70 million euros. 
Somalia faces many other threats besides hunger. 
Rebuilding the country is still being hampered by the violence and terror perpetrated throughout the country by the Islamist Al-Shabaab militias. 
The government controls only some parts of the national territory. 
We have returned to a situation in which relations between Germany and the US are about balancing interests. 
This is quite normal. 
I even have the impression that German-American relations are better than could be expected after the Chancellor’s visit to Washington. 
We’ll have to wait and see how things develop. 
Does that also apply to Trump’s daughter Ivanka? 
Was it a clever move on the part of the Chancellor to invite her to Berlin? 
Certainly from the Federal Chancellor’s perspective. 
However, I must admit that

Germany also provides support for conflict resolution and reconciliation projects. 
In Baidao, Gabriel visited a rehabilitation centre for former Al-Shabaab fighters that is co-financed by Germany and that aims to help them to return to a peaceful civilian life. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to act together with the international community to prevent an imminent disaster. 
More than six million people in the country are already now facing shortages. 
Germany has invited all of the heads of state and government to Hamburg in July. 
What do you have to say to critics of the G20 Summit? 
They should listen to those who don’t hail from the old world of industrialised countries, but rather from Africa or Asia, for example. 
you can’t continue to shape the world like after the Second World War as if you were alone. 
The world has changed. 
New players have joined the global stage. 
The old notion of the G7, that a few major industrial nations meet and the rest are considered to be developing countries, is outdated. 
You have to take care to make sure that the wishes of large parts of the world are not ignored. 
And if not in a city like Hamburg... 
To be honest, 
Nevertheless, 
Or as Andreas Wirsching said: 
Because Hamburg stands as a symbol of open-mindedness, tolerance and intelligence. 
If anyone understands the world, then its the Hanseatic citizens. 
Statement by Federal Minister Gabriel in Somalia 
For some people, globalisation is something new. It has been a fact of life here in Hamburg for centuries. 
Many people here are in danger of dying. 
There is no other city that is more suitable for receiving guests from around the world – 
no one expects everyone to like the decisions that are reached. 
Where should industrial nations and developing countries talk about measures against famines if not at the G20? 
Should the citizens of Hamburg be worried about attacks? 
I would like to encourage critics of globalisation to make their voices heard, but for their protests to remain peaceful. 
Let’s talk about your new role. 
Today, we are in Somalia, a country that for decades has been torn by war and civil war. More recently, it has repeatedly faced severe drought. 
You’ve yet to complete one hundred days in office, and yet your popularity ratings have improved markedly. 
It sounds like you’ve found your dream job. 
We call on all other European countries, on all African countries, and on the United States – as well as on the international community and the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres – to do their part to ensure that people here in the Horn of Africa have at least their most basic needs met, so that they can survive. 
Economic Affairs Minister, SPD Chairman and SPD coordinator in the Federal Government. 
We, as Germans and Europeans, want to help, especially right now, by providing humanitarian aid. 
We will at least double our funding, which currently stands at 70 million euros. Presumably, we will more than double that amount. 
Terrorism, tribal conflict and the threat of famine means that the country is facing enormous challenges. 
To enable long-term peace, the Federal Foreign Office is funding a project in Somalia to build a federal state structure. 
Gabriel visited the Hilaac refugee camp and got a first-hand impression of the disastrous situation on the ground.

Standing Together Against Famine (Article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, published on 12 April 2017) 
The process is apparently quite quick. 
That must be a good feeling for you. 
That wears you down. 
That’s why it was right for me to move aside for Martin Schulz as candidate for Chancellor. 
Do you think that the SPD will continue to increase its level of support? 
Others have already predicted the end of the Schulz hype. 
We will continue to gain in support. 
Was there a point in time when you were still party chairman that there was an O and not a U in the name of the candidate for Chancellor? 
Scholz instead of Schulz? 
Olaf Scholz is one of the most intelligent people in German politics. 
There’s no denying that he is an immensely influential figure in federal politics. 
It was clear to me from a relatively early stage that I wouldn’t be the one.

Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the 2017 Henri Nannen Journalism Awards ceremony 
The problem with being a politician invited to talk about journalists 
Nor can you say what you think, for that only causes trouble. 
there is something going on at present which affects you as journalists, as well as the rest of us. 
Minister of State Michael Roth on the occasion of the 4th German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration 
We’re not quite sure how to resolve this situation, how to deal with it. 
That’s why I believe it’s perhaps also possible on an evening like this, when awards are being handed out to journalists for the work they’ve produced about politicians,to talk as a politician. 
We agree that unilateral actions, mutual accusations and anti-European slogans will not get us anywhere. 
Today, we primarily focused on questions relating to integrating migrants into the labour market. 
A German-Turkish correspondent of a German newspaper, he’s facing serious criminal charges – charges which are incomprehensible to us – for simply doing his job. 
We not only want to provide him with regular consular assistance, we want to see his release. 
Through focusing on success stories in the area of integration, we were able to demonstrate the opportunities and potential offered by migration. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth issued the following statement today (2 May) following talks with the Director of the Department of Advisors to the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Vladimír Spidla, and a Czech delegation at the Federal Foreign Office: 
I am delighted that we had an opportunity to continue our dialogue on migration and integration today. 
And these cases are much more than that. 
Our cooperation is beginning to bear fruit in the form of a joint refugee project in Jordan. 
This demonstrates the tangible impact of our cooperation and friendship. 
We can all see that liberal democracies at any rate are more on the defensive while authoritarian states are more on the offensive – 
even if we’ve experienced developments to the contrary during the last few weeks, especially in Europe. 
What is more, we also engaged in critical reflection on where there is room for improvement. 
The close and frequent consultations taking place between Prague and Berlin have highlighted the common ground between us time and again. 
These freedoms are part of the DNA of every democratic society. 
They are part of our understanding of a constitutional state. 
Unfortunately, when we look around the world, we have to admit that massive infringements of freedom of the press are far too common. 
Although there should actually be consensus on protecting freedom of the press, I’m often told during talks with other government representatives that 
The delegation talks are supplemented by specific projects. 
freedom of the press is a Western concept which isn’t really compatible with their own culture. 
As a result of the dialogue on migration and integration in Prague in November 2016, an agreement was reached to support a project seeking to improve the living conditions of refugees in Jordan. 
Germany is supporting these measures with 1.5 million euros in 2017. 
namely that the so-called Western values should primarily be understood in geographical terms. 
The Russian Foreign Minister once told me that we were living in a post-Western age. 
Together with Czechia, the Federal Government is supporting a project in the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan that is overseen by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). 
We have to combat this idea of the West. 
The objective of the project is to expand and maintain existing refugee accommodation and to distribute humanitarian aid supplies. 
For freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights aren’t confined to one geographical area. Rather, they should apply universally to everyone on this planet. 
Czechia has contributed a similar sum. 
In January 2016, Minister of State Roth and Vladimír Spidla established the German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration, a format in which they meet alternately in Prague and Berlin and are joined by expert delegations. 
When forcefully criticising problems abroad and resolutely campaigning for things to change, we should, however, never be self-righteous. 
In my view at least, the American presidential campaign was not a shining example of how to treat each other fairly, especially with regards to communication with and via the media. 
That applies not only to politicians but also to journalists and enlightened citizens. 
We have to examine whether what we ourselves consider right is actually based on facts. 
There was a lot of fake news in the past which was declared to be true but was later found to be false. 
It’s also about how NGOs, civil society and academics are treated. 
This is not just about freedom of the press. 
Even in Europe, such draft laws are being introduced in an attempt to intimidate society. 
We shouldn’t therefore just complacently pat one another on the back and say: 
“Everything is fine in our own country, that couldn’t happen here.” 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visits the African Union 
Working together to prevent humanitarian crises: 
We have held discussions on an equal footing about common European solutions in the area of refugees, migration and integration. 
Our cooperation with Czechia is very constructive indeed and is taking place in a spirit of mutual trust. 
While we do not always share the same opinion with regard to migration policy, we are reaching out to each other and working together in a solution-oriented manner. 
But not because of me! 
I hope that more journalists will come to us politicians well-prepared and that they’ll challenge us. 
For that makes it clear what we stand for as a society, what our DNA is: a competition of ideas and arguments. 
Journalism which places news in a context and puts us politicians on the spot by posing tough and critical questions.

Journalists are not a fourth power. 
They’re not a branch of government authority. 
They’re not part of the state. 
Thank goodness. 
However, journalists need time and resources for this. 
Of course, they also need time and resources to gather information, to research and to get a good training. 
For that they need the support of their publishing houses and media organisations. 
I know that publishing houses and media organisations are businesses which have to be profitable. 
If quality journalism didn’t exist, then we would have to invent it. 
However, we have to protect it. 
After the meeting, Gabriel said that “we can only avert the threat of famine by working together.” 
For we all sense that the language used in politics is changing. 
He went on to say that 
“we need a strong African Union.” 
Kurt Tucholsky, himself a brilliant and critical journalist in very unstable times, once said that 
readers were lucky because they could choose their own authors. 
I want to change this sentence a little. 
Would it not be more accurate to say today that 
journalists aren’t so lucky because they cannot choose their readers? 
For me, the key question is: 
Mobilising humanitarian aid 
How can the alternative echo chambers in which people are often entrenched be broken up again? 
I’ve no qualms about stating that both politicians and the media have to take responsibility for this. 
The knee-jerk reaction of some will be to say: 
We have to take this responsibility seriously. 
However, each of us has to do so in their own sphere, and on their own. 
There was an anchorman in the US who ended every broadcast with the words 
What I don’t want to see is a truth sanctioned by the state or the media. 
As committed journalists and also as publishing houses and media organisations, your contribution to this is vital. 
thus underscoring our responsibility for him and the many other journalists in prison. 
I believe you deserve thanks for that and for your tremendous commitment to a vibrant democracy. 
For weeks now, Germany has been working to mobilise international aid. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Development Minister Müller have issued an appeal to the international community with the Berlin Humanitarian Call, urging that action be taken before time runs out. 
Preventing crises and conflicts 
without training, without a readiness to give people time to become journalists – journalists like the ones we have seen here today – none of this will be possible. That’s what distinguishes quality journalism from the host of information which is not put into a context, which is not verified and which we find on social media today. 
Encouraging dialogue 
They’ve become open at the fringes for nationalist rhetoric, for verbal comments of all kinds aimed at excluding or marginalising – as well as for harsh criticism of the media. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with Ethiopian Prime Minister Desalegn 
As a regional power in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia plays an important role for maintaining stability in the region. It also participates in several AU and UN peace missions. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in Somalia 
Berlin Humanitarian Call 
Support for the African Union 
We want to make this progress by having heated discussions about the issue at hand while, at the same time, accepting the facts. 
Ethiopia country profile 
In Addis Ababa, where the organisation’s headquarters is located, Gabriel held talks with the current Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat. 
While in Addis Ababa, Gabriel also met in the afternoon with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn. 
After the meeting, Gabriel met with representatives of civil society and members of opposition parties. 
That said, international observers are concerned about the domestic situation in the country. 
Gabriel therefore extended an invitation to Faki to participate in the G20 Summit in Germany. 
But joking aside, I was very happy to accept this invitation and did so out of firm conviction, for – as the first contributions have made clear – 
Although, it has to be said that just as journalists aren’t a homogeneous group, nor are politicians. 
However, award winners personify the power generated by a journalism which is free, inquiring, interested and informative. That’s why this evening is such a great event. 
At the same time, I can’t help thinking about those colleagues who haven’t been awarded prizes in their countries but instead have been put in prison for their journalistic work. 
Deniz Yücel’s situation really brings this home to us. 
He has now been in prison for more than two months, treatment which is both unnecessary and completely disproportionate. 
The first visit to Deniz Yücel in prison two weeks ago was important, but it wasn’t nearly enough. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on World Press Freedom Day 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (2 May) to mark World Press Freedom Day: 
setting each other ultimatums. 
Turkey's path to the European Union 
is clearly described with the criteria 
does not fulfil these criteria. 
if we want a new start in the conditions 
in the relations, 
then this has to come from both sides. 
The EU Foreign Ministers made this plain 
No-one is closing the door, 
we are open to new talks. 
On the other hand, I feel there is only a point 
if Turkey also shows that 
it wants to end the confrontation. 
What we are now hearing are new ultimatums, 
Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. 
We are available. 
However, it must be possible to speak, print and post it. 
The media must be free – both online and offline. 
But it also has to mean that the time 
of setting ultimatums is over. 
My simple advice is to now stop 
which we have as Europeans. 
Every year on 3 May we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, when we remind ourselves of the state of freedom of the press around the world and call for the independence of the media and journalists as well as their personal security. 
that doesn't help anyone. 
If it wants Europe to be 
prepared to talk, Turkey, for its part, 
a new start in relations. 
Freedom of the press is an essential prerequisite for realising human rights – for how can we find out about human rights violations if it is not possible to report on them? 
The last year has seen many attacks on freedom of the press. Only a few days ago, the Turkish Government decided to extend the state of emergency by another three months. 
Emergency decrees have already led to the closure of many media outlets and the arrest of many critical journalists. 
In Russia, Novaya Gazeta was the target of threats after it drew attention to crimes committed against LGBTI individuals in Chechnya. 
Her colleague Anna Politkovskaya, who also reported on the situation in Chechnya, was killed for openly speaking the truth. 
Last autumn I spoke to a journalist in Hong Kong, and early this year to a journalist from Uganda in Berlin. 
On World Press Freedom Day, I would like to express my respect to all journalists who put themselves at great risk to provide truly free reporting and to give them my thanks for their important work. 
The fact that the German journalist Deniz Yücel is being held on remand demonstrates how far governments will go to prevent undesirable reporting. 
The journalist who uncovered these crimes has now gone into hiding. 
Here in Germany, Deniz Yücel is perhaps the best known journalist in prison. 
They indicate the direction in which any given country or society is moving. 
Freedom of the press is not an accessory or luxury in which we can indulge when times are good. 
That’s actually paradoxical given that most governments have clearly stated their commitment – also through binding international treaties – to protect freedom of the press. 
However, there’s a danger that this will result in a quite fundamental misapprehension, 
That Western values were only supported and appreciated by those who grew up in a Western culture. 
Sometimes, as some of the work for which prizes are being awarded today makes very clear, these Western values are championed more by demonstrators in Tahrir Square than by governments in countries which lie in the West geographically speaking. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met with African Union representatives in Addis Ababa to discuss how the threat of famine in the region can be averted. 
What has been happening recently in Turkey 
If we now want new approaches, 
last week in Malta. 
new confrontations - 
also needs to signal that it is ready for 
Yesterday, during a visit to Somalia, Gabriel pledged to provide an additional 70 million euros to help avert the threat of famine. 
However, we shouldn’t ignore the fact that what we experienced during the campaign was, in my opinion, the outcome rather than the start of a trend. 
This is why Germany supports the AU in its efforts to develop its own instruments for promoting peace, democracy and growth. 
Both of them told me in great detail how it is possible to control the media landscape purely through financial pressure and without violence – under very different circumstances but with the same result. 
For it has to be said that fake news is much older than the current debate about it. 
Sometimes we have to be careful and critically analyse even phenomena of which we approve. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel with Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat 
During his trip to the Horn of Africa, Foreign Minister Gabriel on Tuesday (2 May) met with representatives of the African Union. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel believes the organisation plays a key role in shaping Africa’s future. 
Gabriel believes the organisation plays a key role in shaping Africa’s future. 
He also pointed out that, to solve conflicts around the world, modern Africa must be given a seat at the table. 
In view of the threat of famine in the Horn of Africa, Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to the region to mobilise additional humanitarian aid and gain a first-hand impression of the situation on the ground. 
His talks with Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat also focused on the current humanitarian crises. 
Besides the Horn of Africa, the Lake Chad region is experiencing acute shortages, as well. 
As the international organisation that comprises all states on the African continent, the African Union is key to preventing crises and conflicts. 
Therefore Foreign Minister Gabriel encouraged Prime Minister Desalegn to engage in talks with the opposition and tackle much-needed reforms. 
They have a balanced budget, have stopped making cutbacks to schools and have created 80,000 new jobs. 
But he still needs to fight. 
Because Schleswig-Holstein is traditionally CDU territory. 
But Torsten Albig is an excellent man for Schleswig-Holstein, 
We’re seeing NGOs laws everywhere, including in the heart of Europe, which we normally only associate with autocratic states. 
We have to admit there are problems here in Europe when we look at the situation in Hungary, where academic freedom is being called into question and where the state is again exerting its authority, thus threatening the freedom and very existence of press organs. 
Something that, while it has often been prophesied, has not happened in Germany. 
How can we explain this? 
France is much more of a class society than Germany. 
The fragility of freedom of the press in Europe, as well as freedom of expression, should make us more aware that even here in Germany we have to actively protect this fundamental democratic value. We cannot take it for granted. 
It’s true, as has been clearly demonstrated this evening, that there is a lot of critical, in-depth, young and surprising journalism here in Germany. 
For the best way to combat the intolerable talk of the “lying media”, which is supposedly in cohoots with politicians, is to ask tough and persistent questions and conduct interviews with “firm politeness” when necessary. 
For we still plan to go for a beer together. We’ve been wanting to do that for the last four years ... 
They stand alongside the state, 
which should safeguard their rights. 
They have to examine whether the three actual branches of state authority really are carrying out their tasks in conformity with the constitution. 
They should ensure that citizens are able to judge whether the institutions which actually exercise state authority, which of course is derived solely from the people, really are up to the job. 
Industry in the digital age 
focusing on the political objectives, the current challenges and the initial results of measures already implemented in Germany. 
Did your escalation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu really have to happen on the day after Holocaust Remembrance Day? 
rather the Israeli Prime Minister issued me an ultimatum: 
More and more people seem to be giving in to this very temptation to berate representatives of the established media – and, it goes without saying, politicians – and, at the same time, to become cocooned in their own world-view. 
My daughter and I found the documents that belonged to these victims in Yad Vashem a few years ago. 
As you can imagine, I am profoundly moved each time I go there. 
I underscored Germany’s friendship with Israel and the Jews. 
To win back those who believe that “alternative facts” are more reliable than reality. 
there we have it – the political establishment and the traditional media are hand in glove with one another. 
So you deliberately chose to hold this meeting with critics? 
Meetings such as these are a staple of our programmes for visits, including in Europe. 
Rather we need lively discussions – in politics as well as between politicians and those who report and comment on politics. 
We should be careful not to exaggerate such things. 
He’s now been in office for precisely one hundred days. Have things been as bad as many feared? 
The statements made by Trump and his entourage during the election campaign were, rightly, cause for a great deal of concern. 
However, when such a diversity of opinions threatens to turn into an “anything goes” situation where every verified fact can be called into question and indeed is, then we have quite a lot to do. 
But when I see the creativity which young media professionals in particular employ not only to make use of today’s world of communication but also to reflect and comment on it, when I see the range of projects for which prizes were awarded here today, then I am hopeful that we will make progress. 
The workshop aimed to analyse the digital transformation’s diverse effects on industry and the labour market, to present successful strategies for implementing Industrie 4.0 and to identify additional necessary framework conditions. 
We want to achieve this by being tolerant and accepting the opinions and views of others, 
and by not shouting these opinions down – either by raising our voices or by posting loutish remarks online. 
For a vibrant democracy needs a debating culture which is lively and inclusive – and not one which uses friend-or-foe propaganda that stamps out any chance of reaching an understanding. 
There were fears that there could be a trade war and it appeared as if, on Russia, they wanted to ignore the conflict in eastern Ukraine while China was targeted by his supporters. 
pointing out that the aim was to strengthen industrial competitiveness in Germany and make Germany a leading market for Industrie 4.0 applications and solutions. 
Much of this has fallen by the wayside now, or has been watered down considerably. 
… than himself? 
The key policy instrument, he said, was the Plattform Industrie 4.0, set up at Hannover Messe 2015 and involving policymakers, the business sector, trade unions and the scientific community. 
Now the Trump administration says that it doesn’t want regime change in North Korea, but rather security and has offered to hold talks. 
Perhaps we’ve even managed to stop the US President from imposing import duties on Germany. 
We must travel to the US often, talk to each other a great deal and write lots of invitations... 
I still find it strange when family relatives, who were never elected, suddenly start behaving like state guests and are revered almost as if they were members of a royal family. 
As a north German, I probably have a greater affinity with the restraint of the Hanseatic citizens and their republican ethos. 
Where else should Germany invite its guests? 
Allow me to say this to the citizens of Hamburg and to all the critics: 
And if there is one country that’s considered to be a fair mediator, then it’s Germany. 
No, many security precautions will be taken. During the G20, Hamburg will probably be the safest city in the world. 
You shouldn’t underestimate the time you spend working as SPD Chairman. 
With respect to popularity, it’s easy to explain this turnaround. 
I never thought that this had anything to do with me personally anyway. 
As SPD Chairman, I had to fight almost every domestic political conflict tooth and nail, in the party and in society, for seven and half years. 
Were you surprised by his runaway performance in the polls? 
I was also surprised by how fast these things can happen. 
I don’t foresee an end to this, and the election campaign is only just getting under way. 
I wouldn’t have done this without or against them. 
Scholz is currently locked in election campaigns in Schleswig-Holstein. 
The CDU and SPD are neck and neck in the polls. 
Who’s going to win? 
If performance is any yardstick to go by, then Torsten Albig must be re-elected as Minister-President. 
What else does he need to prove? 
which is why I’m quite optimistic that he’ll stay on as Minister-President. 
A new President is being elected in France at around the same time as the elections in Schleswig-Holstein. 
What signal does it send when a man who essentially doesn’t have the backing of a political party is able to get so far? 
It shows how unhappy the French are with their current situation and with the party system in the Fifth Republic. 
Our country is held together by the social market economy. 
And, at the end of the day, people turn on their TVs, read the “Hamburger Abendblatt” and see that, 
He made it clear that freedom of expression was part and parcel of each and every democracy, and was therefore also a characteristic of Israel. 
What personal connection do you have with Holocaust Remembrance Day? 
In my family, there were both Holocaust deniers such as my father and Holocaust victims such as my grown-up daughter’s great-grandparents. 
And yet you are critical of the Israeli Government’s policy. 
The current regime isn’t Israel, even if it is keen to portray itself as being so. 
This has never been an issue in the past – probably because it’s such a matter of course. However, I regret the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister, whom I have met on many occasions, cancelled our meeting. 
Now Donald Trump says: 
we have carried out a military attack against the Syrians owing to the use of poison gas, but don’t want things to escalate, but rather peace negotiations with the involvement of Russia. 
If you are involved in day-to-day German politics, then people can be divided into supporters and opponents of the respective parties and popularity ratings are balanced. 
“I can think of no better city” 
I can think of no better city than Hamburg. 
These countries say: 
not to mention the fact that the heads of state and government will be coming with a few thousand members of staff in tow and we’ll be needing enough good hotels. 
However, it’s worthwhile taking a moment to think about why the Chinese and others want to hold such meetings and why the Africans are pleased to be invited. 
Where should the world meet if not in such formats? 
It’s certainly not that family-friendly, but it doesn’t take up as much extra time as the three jobs that I held previously – 
You’ve also said that this new job is more family-friendly than both of your former roles. 
Your erstwhile unpopularity was apparently not so much a function of your personality as your role. 
However, it was always clear to you that 
if you weren’t chosen as a candidate for Chancellor, then it would be Schulz. 
And there are two people that I held intensive discussions with about who it should be: 
No one was more in the loop than they were. 
And that rings quite true. 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Elke Büdenbender will be paying their first official visit to the State of Israel and to the Palestinian territories from 6 to 9 May 2017. 
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, who is among those with whom Federal President Steinmeier will meet in Jerusalem, invited Steinmeier to visit the country. 
Amongst other things, he will visit German-Israeli cooperation projects and hold discussions with civil society representatives and students at The Hebrew University. 
In the Palestinian territories, the Federal President will meet with President Mahmoud Abbas and visit a training centre that receives financial support from Germany. 
With his trip, the Federal President wants to both pay tribute to and deepen the special friendship between Germany and Israel. 
German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration in Berlin 
On 2 May the German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration took place for the fourth time. 
The discussion format was launched in January 2016 at the instigation of Minister of State Roth. 
Since then, the Dialogue has become a key component of bilateral relations between Germany and Czechia. 
Syrian refugees: 
joint project in Jordan 
Members of parliament, experts from various ministries and civil society representatives from both countries gathered in Berlin for the fourth meeting. 
The main topics were the integration of refugees into the labour market and the presentation of a joint German-Czech project to support Syrian refugees in the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan. 
He said that both countries had pooled their resources to create a project that “is worthwhile and will serve to benefit specific individuals.” 
Forum for open and constructive communication 
Minister of State Roth said with regard to the German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration: 
Andrássy Gyula German-language University in Budapest (AUB) 
Once again, we see that it is always better to talk to each other rather than about each other. 
Even though we do not always see eye to eye with Czechia in the area of refugee policy. 
With the Dialogue we have established a forum which facilitates open and constructive communication. 
We want to focus on what we have in common and drive forward initiatives. 
Andrássy University Budapest (AUB) was established in 2001 by two German Federal States, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, as well as by Austria and Hungary. 
This makes the Dialogue on Migration and Integration a true source of encouragement in Europe. 
I hope that many will be inspired to follow in its footsteps.” 
A tradition with its own particular content which enables us to focus on the future.” 
He went on to say that the project was also a vehicle for further cooperation. 
The Federal Government is represented in the foundation by Germany’s current ambassador to Hungary. 
Behind the scenes: 
in Somalia with the Foreign Minister 
Here, our colleague shares his harrowing impressions from behind the scenes of an extraordinary trip. 
Hilac refugee camp in Somalia 
Beforehand, I was certainly sometimes concerned that we could end up as adversaries. 
You have to cooperate with us. 
If you stay out of this and hold an office in which you represent Germany in the world, then people perceive you differently. 
But I anticipated that we would get above 30 percent and that we would get much stronger still during the election campaign. 
Has Emmanuel Macron already made it? 
It’s very important for him to make it because he’s the only one in the French election campaign to clearly stand up for Europe. 
while perhaps not everything is rosy here, things are certainly much better than in most parts of the world. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe. 
That has nothing to do with Holocaust Remembrance Day, the day before. 
I was most gratified that the Israeli President took an entirely different view of the matter. 
The meeting with him was very relaxed and very friendly and lasted much longer than originally planned. 
With respect to Holocaust Remembrance Day, he also said, by the way, that not all criticism of Israel was tantamount to anti-Semitism. 
It was also with this in mind that I acknowledged Germany’s historic responsibility for the Holocaust and the crimes of the Second World War on my visit to the country. 
Things appear to be turning out better, thank goodness. 
But they are by no means good, yet. 
Most of the diplomats who accompany Gabriel have seen a fair bit of the world. 
Hundreds of thousands are at risk of starvation 
It is the second stage of a special trip by Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
Never before has a German Foreign Minister visited Somalia. 
It is regarded as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 
Islamist militias, tribal leaders and government forces continue to fight one another. 
A white UN propeller-driven aircraft takes Gabriel to Mogadishu, the first stop on his trip. 
The United Nations has a small base directly at the airport. 
Blue helmets from Uganda and international special forces guard the small container village in the sweltering heat. 
While Gabriel holds talks with the Somalian Foreign Minister, the accompanying journalists are driven around the grounds. 
The cars are so heavily armoured that the doors can only be opened with two hands. 
After the political talks in Mogadishu, we travel on to south-western Somalia. 
Many areas in the region are controlled by militias. 
Throughout Somalia, there are now more than one million people who have fled their homes. 
No doctors, no schools, no work 
A family at a refugee camp near Baidoa 
When we disembark, our shoes sink ankle-deep into the soft ground. 
The red clay is home to tens of thousands of refugee families. 
The men, women and children crouching here in the mud have no access to medical care, jobs or schooling. 
Gabriel tries to talk to the people with the help of an interpreter. 
A woman crouches in front of her tent with a coughing baby in her arms. 
Like thousands of others, she can only survive thanks to the aid supplies. 
Yet the situation is becoming more and more acute. 
Every day, increasing numbers of people are fleeing to camps like this one in Baidoa to escape starvation. 
Gabriel has decided to double German assistance for Somalia to almost 140 million euros. 
Yet Germany will not be able to save the people in Somalia singlehandedly. 
In an appeal to the international community, Gabriel declares, “What we urgently need is more international assistance.” 
As the propeller-driven aircraft takes off from the runway in Baidoa, the sea of tents gradually disappears on the horizon. 
However, the images of the devastated city and the suffering of the people there will no doubt accompany the Minister and his staff for a long time to come. 
In the piles of rubbish and debris, emaciated goats are looking for grass, veiled girls wade through the mud with bundles of firewood. 
“Is that the refugee camp already?” the passenger asks. 
The poverty in the streets of Baidoa, home to 130,000 people, is only the tip of the iceberg. 
The country has been wracked by more than 20 years of civil war, terrorism and economic slump. 
Special Federal Police forces accompany Gabriel and his staff at every step. 
A security briefing is held before take-off in Germany. 
Before their departure, all travellers have been asked to provide their blood group as well as the size of bullet-proof vest they will need. 
The constructions moving past the bulletproof windows are more ruins than houses, shacks made of metal and plastic bags sinking down into red mud. 
But what is at the end of the 30-minute drive through the ravaged urban landscape leaves no visitor unmoved. 
For security reasons the visit is kept secret until the delegation has left the country again. 
In the vicinity of Baidoa, Gabriel wants to see for himself the situation of the people who have fled from other parts of the country to escape famine and violence. 
As far as the eye can see, waist-high huts have been built on the bare ground from branches tied together with strips of old cloth. 
Now, severe drought has driven the country to the brink of famine which could claim hundreds of thousands of lives throughout the entire region.

Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth with Vladimír Ṧpidla, advisor to the Czech Prime Minister, at the Federal Foreign Office 
Vladimír Ṧpidla expressed his delight that the Dialogue on Migration and Integration had clarified the approach Czechia and Germany should take to help improve the situation of refugees in Jordan. 
“If the Dialogue didn’t already exist, we would have to invent it. 
Vladimír Ṧpidla declared: 
“I am very glad that the meetings between Czechia and Germany within the context of the strategic dialogue on the issue of migration has already become something of a tradition. 
Click here to read the press release by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth on the 4th German-Czech Dialogue on Migration and Integration (2 May 2017). 
“Don’t move away from the group under any circumstances, not even 100 metres away,” the commander instructs the members of the delegation. 
On the fringes of Baidoa, the Minister’s mud-spattered motorcade comes to a halt. 
She tells the Minister that she used to have several cows, but the drought claimed them one by one. 
A colleague from the Federal Foreign Office’s Website Editorial Office accompanies the Foreign Minister on his travels, publishing reports of the trips on the website and on social media.

is that you have to be careful not to be too nice, for then everyone thinks you’re sucking up to them. 
Some 200 journalists are in prison, as are more than 150 online activists. 
Every one of these cases is an intolerable encroachment of individual freedom - a threat to the person concerned - and indeed a curtailment of freedom of the press in general. 
For supposedly rock-solid values such as freedom of the press and fair debate in the media aren’t always in the best of health in the so-called West either. 
When I see that the presence of publishing houses from other European countries is evidently viewed critically in Poland while, at the same time, public broadcasting institutions have been prompted to toe the government line, we notice that this problem seems to go far beyond what we thought. 
At least when they’re not criminal or connected to criminal activities. 
I’d intended to welcome Ms Slomka at this point, but I don’t think she’s here this evening. 
What we don’t want, of course, is a consensual mishmash. 
Thank goodness it does exist. 
“The boundaries with regard to what is acceptable to say in public have shifted.” 
Who does quality journalism reach today? 
When I read that in a survey conducted early this year 42% of those questioned said they believed the information supplied by the German media wasn’t reliable, then I believe we have to take urgent action to win back those who have turned their backs on these media. 
It would thus be fitting if as many media outlets as possible support the concert in support of Deniz Yücel in Berlin on 3 May, World Press Freedom Day,

“How much plain speaking must a foreign minister do?” 
Since assuming office, Sigmar Gabriel has been on 27 trips abroad. 
In this interview, he takes stock of his first 100 days as Foreign Minister. 
Published in the BILD newspaper on 5 May 2017. 
What surprised you most in these 100 days? 
Or an 8 year-old Iraqi girl, a refugee, living in Hasansham camp near Erbil. She was born deaf, severely wounded in a fire, and then she was driven from her home by IS. 
She’s already experienced more hardship than anyone should have to bear in their entire life. 
Even with those that are responsible for the suffering you speak of? 
Is that really necessary? 
You and Chancellor Merkel have underscored that you want to remain in dialogue even with anti-democratic regimes. 
If we want ceasefires to be agreed, we have to talk to the parties waging the wars. 
But we should not apply double standards. 
If we only want to talk to people who are like us, then I’d never have to fly anywhere more than two hours away! 
How much plain speaking must a foreign minister do? 
As much as possible. 
Sometimes it’s not possible in public, but in private it has to be done. 
What has talking to Putin achieved in the past few years? 
It cannot be in Russia’s lasting interest to support the Syrian butchers who kill their own people with poison gas. 
Yes, the US strike was understandable as a direct and targeted response to an unacceptable use of poison gas by the Assad regime. 
And hopefully it will deter the Assad regime from using poison gas again. 
But it goes without saying that military action will not bring peace to Syria. 
On your first official visit to Israel you wanted to meet organisations that are extremely critical of the government. 
Your talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu were cancelled as a result. 
Looking back, would you do the same again? 
I therefore thought it was a great gesture that the Israeli President took a lot of time for us and alluded to the right of freedom of expression in Israel. 
What would have been the problem with postponing your meeting? 
Democrats don’t give each other ultimatums. 
There are always two things we have to do simultaneously. We have to defend our values and we have to assert our political interests. 
It’s true that peace has not been restored in eastern Ukraine, but the negotiations between Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine did avert an escalation of the conflict. 
Iran has ended its nuclear programme because we pursued the negotiations to a successful conclusion. 
And in Syria, the aim now is to help Russia out of the corner it has manoeuvred itself into. 
That’s why it is a big mistake for President Trump to increase spending on arms and cut spending on development assistance. 
It thus seems self-evident to me to hear what the critics have to say, too. 
Surprised isn’t the right word, but I was not prepared for how close I would get to almost inconceivable human suffering, and how deeply that would affect me. 
In Somalia on Monday, for example – thousands of people who have been displaced by drought, forced to live in hunger in dirty tents where everything is caked in mud. 
Anyone who criticises talking to Russia’s President Putin has to explain why it’s all right to maintain good relations with China, and vice versa. 
This message can only be got across by means of diplomacy. It certainly won’t be communicated by dropping bombs. 
And yet you seemed more understanding when the US bombed Syrian airports after the latest poison gas attack. 
Among democrats, it has to be possible to meet with organisations critical of the government as well as any others. 
It is not just us who think that Israel’s settlement policy is a violation of international law and an obstacle to the peace process. The Netanyahu Government’s policy on this is also extremely controversial in Israel. 
“Every generation must fight for Europe anew” 
The Israeli Prime Minister wanted to force me to cancel a meeting with respectable Israeli citizens because they are critical of his policies towards the Palestinians. 
We need a new start, with specific projects that build new trust in Europe and that create true added value and prospects for young people everywhere in Europe. 
We can, and we must, do much more in this area. 
It is truly worth it, because it increases every individual’s opportunities, and it strengthens the European project overall. 
Exchange programmes such as Erasmus can be geared much more towards all young people, including vocational trainees, not only university students. 
We should also expand the European Voluntary Service. 
Europe must not be an elitist project. 
We do not want an “academic Europe”, but a “Europe for all”. 
More than one third wants the EU to hand power back to national governments. 
Overall, only half of young Europeans consider democracy to be the best form of government. 
For more information, please visit: 
It is crucial that we win back the hearts of young people across our continent; we must rekindle their belief in the future of Europe. 
“Every generation must fight for the common European project anew. 
A large majority supports the common European project. 
We must not turn a blind eye to this common view, and we must act to correct it. 
This applies in particular to using what we have learned at European level about training young people. 
The TUI Foundation asked young people in several EU countries about their opinions on Europe for its Young Europe 2017 study. 
I’m not so much worried about the very good results in Germany – most young people in our country appear to be happy with their life and with the opportunities that Europe affords them. 
What is particularly worrisome is that this has also damaged faith in democracy. 
According to it, many young Europeans have critical views of the specific political objectives and plans of the EU and do not like the way EU institutions function. 
When the French head to the polls the day after tomorrow, they also will be voting on the future of the European peace project. 
Yesterday, the TUI Foundation issued its Young Europe 2017 youth study. Its findings are unsettling and should be a call to action. 
That is very good. 
However, the situation elsewhere in Europe is different, and this is especially true in France. 
Half a generation of economic and social troubles and concerns about the future have left deep scars on the political consciousness of European youths, and the faith in Europe of many has been eroded. 
In the public's opinion, the only area in which the EU creates advantages is economic cooperation.

Foreign Minister Gabriel on Emmanuel Macron’s election as French president 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (7 May) on the outcome of the French presidential elections: 
This is a good day for France – 
and it is a good day for Europe and for Germany! 
The French people have chosen optimism, reform and open-mindedness. They have chosen liberty, equality and fraternity – and they have rejected isolationism, cynicism and hatred. 
I am very pleased that my friend Emmanuel Macron has claimed this victory. 
Employers, too, help to induct people into the culture of their transatlantic partners, 
with hundreds of thousands of Americans working in German companies’ US offices and vice versa. 
Europe is worth betting on! 
More than 17 million US servicemen and women, plus their families, have spent time living in Germany since the end of the Second World War. 
US-German links are deeply rooted in history. 
Around 15 percent of all Americans claim to have German roots. 
Although German-Americans are not a cohesive group influencing US political life, 
there are countless German-American associations devoted to upholding German customs and traditions. 
Jewish organisations 
The German Government, the Bundestag, political parties and foundations maintain close contacts with Jewish organisations in the US. 
If he should fail, Ms Le Pen will assume the presidency five years from now, and the European project would be thrown to the wolves. 
Therefore, reforms are needed in France. 
We Germans now have an obligation to support him. 
Those who tackle reforms must not at the same time be forced to maintain strong budgetary restraints. 
That is why the time for financial orthodoxy and lecturing must now finally be over. 
We have the strongest economy in Europe. 
Long Night of Ideas: 
It was France that paved the way for us. 
High-level meetings take place regularly. 
American Jewish organisations’ interest in Germany has increased appreciably in recent years. 
This interest is also a sign of recognition for Germany’s close relations with Israel. 
Then in May 2012, he was the guest of honour at the American Jewish Committee Global Forum in Washington. 
Therefore, we must now give up our financial orthodoxy. 
Germany and France must now assume joint responsibility. 
It is in our political, and also in our economic, interest to support France in this way. 
On the evening of 12 May 2017, we will show you the full spectrum of cultural relations and education policy at 17 prominent locations of Berlin’s cultural scene – from the Humboldt-Forum to the Maxim Gorki Theater to the Wissenschaftsforum on the Gendarmenmarkt. 
We should act just as wisely. 
Because this makes it impossible to invest in growth and creates less, not more, employment. 
We are a leading exporter in Europe and in the world and, as such, we benefit most from the European single market. 
We owe at least as much gratitude to France as we do to the United States for the Marshall Plan. 
As Germans, we should join France in building a Franco-German investment fund. 
Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl knew this was the right thing to do. 
They are interested in how Germany is handling the history of the Shoah, and in what is happening in Germany now –

We would like to invite you to come up to the roof of the Federal Foreign Office to take a look at the Open AArtist Studio, 
where you can meet the artist Said Baalbaki for a chat and sample a spot of experimental music. 
Baalbaki witnessed the Lebanese civil war as a child and examines issues of identity and memory in the age of global conflicts in his works. 
The Open AArtist Studio will be on show from 6 to 11 p.m. during the Long Night of Ideas on 12 May. 
It was with this in mind that the Federal Foreign Office was the first federal ministry to set up an international in-house artist-in-residence programme in cooperation with the Galleries Association of Berlin (lvbg) in 2016. 
and receive a grant to this end. 
The Open AArtist Studio featuring the German-Lebanese artist Said Baalbaki is open to the public during the Long Night of Ideas. 
He has proven to us all that, by taking a clear stance and sending clear messages, it is possible to resist the enemies of Europe, the nationalists, the populists and those who are offering simple solutions by taking a clear stance and sending clear messages. 
Emmanuel Macron’s victory is also a call to action for us in Germany, - 
because Emmanuel Macron must be successful. 
Emmanuel Macron knows this, and he clearly said so during the campaign. 
Without brave individuals like the Frenchman Robert Schuman, Germany would never have been invited back into the fold of civilised European nations after the terrible crimes it committed during the Second World War. 
On 24 April 2017, at the OECD workshop on “Going Digital: The Future of Industry and Jobs", the Director for Industrial Policy at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Markus Heß, presented Germany’s strategy for implementing Industrie 4.0, 
On 24 April 2017, the OECD Working Party on Industry Analysis organised a workshop on “Going Digital: The Future of Industry and Jobs”. 
As part of a series of addresses on the framework conditions and policy instruments, Mr Heß outlined Germany’s Industrie 4.0 strategy, 
The main ideas behind this multi-stakeholder platform, he went on, were to come up with recommendations for companies on various topics, e.g. IT security, to establish national and international cooperation arrangements relating to Industrie 4.0, and to mobilise SMEs. 
The creation of Mittelstand 4.0 Competence Centres and an online map on Industrie 4.0 would, Mr Heß added, help SMEs in particular with the in-house implementation of Industrie 4.0. 
After Mr Heß had spoken, representatives of Italy and Japan presented their national concepts on Industrie 4.0. 
The results of the workshops will feed, among other things, into the horizontal OECD project “Going Digital: Making the Transformation Work for Growth and Well-being” launched under the German G20 Presidency. 
The French presidential elections have an impact far beyond the country’s borders – both on Germany as France’s closest partner and on Europe as a whole. 
What can we hope for from our neighbour in future? 
And what should we offer the new French Government? 
Given the difficult international situation, as well as the destructive forces of populism and nationalism in Europe, we have an obligation to work even closer together with France in future in order to strengthen Europe. 
Europe’s political geography will change dramatically with the forthcoming Brexit. 
Germany has a growing responsibility to act more as a mediator within Europe and not to take sides. 
In the last few years, we have asked much of our partners – when it comes to cuts, reforms and solidarity with us. 
And in terms of substance, we have not always been wrong. 
However, these messages were often received quite differently than we intended by our partners. 
But we can only successfully stand together in Europe if everyone feels understood, if they do not feel left behind and if they see themselves as equal winners. 
We should also approach the new French Government in this spirit.

For if we succeed in formulating a European agenda for the future in partnership with France, then we can win the support of other countries. 
For we have to coordinate economic, social and employment policies in a binding manner. 
We should promote education and employment in such a way that people see the entire EU as a community of social justice, fair opportunities and prosperity. 
Secondly, we are keen to see a union of solidarity: 
For that, thirdly, we have to invest more in research, infrastructure and digital networks. 
For success in reducing youth unemployment will be crucial if the EU is to win back the trust it has lost. 
We will have to spend more rather than less money on this – admittedly ambitious – agenda. 
For these are urgently needed investments. 
I cannot imagine a better partner for this than France. 
I hope that our two countries can greatly advance European integration. 
Finally, it is vital that we convince our citizens that this is the way forward. 
Everywhere, especially in Germany and France, people are taking to the streets every week to show their support for Europe. 
Europe is close to their hearts. 
This gives us hope that the Franco-German friendship can again be strong and ambitious – dedicated to fostering a united Europe. 
Germany should mediate in Europe, not take sides 
We have to move towards our partners so that there is once again more room for compromise. 
As a member state with a successful economy, we have done this from a position of strength. 
A stronger institutional bulwark, whether in the form of a eurozone minister, an own budget or a eurozone parliament, is needed. 
we can prevent a race to the bottom with regard to social benefits by implementing minimum social standards in Europe. 
Fourthly, we should strengthen internal and external security in a way that allows us to protect our freedoms from terrorists. 
With this objective in mind, we should also broaden the Élysée Treaty, the foundation of our cooperation, to include the European dimension. 
AU-Germany donor coordination meeting 
The African Union and the Federal Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany co-hosted a meeting in Berlin on 22 March 2017 to discuss donor coordination in the field of small arms control. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of donors from the G7 countries as well as Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, the European Union and NATO. 
Representatives of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Small Arms Survey (SAS) and the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) also took part. 
Representatives of all organisations involved attended the meeting 
The morning session gave the donor representatives the opportunity to exchange information on their current projects and priorities. 
In 2014/15 alone, more than 10,000 German students were enrolled at US universities, while 11,000 American students studied in Germany on a long or short-term basis. 
At the start of his term of office, Foreign Minister Gabriel met representatives of the Jewish organisations in the United States in February 2017. 
an interest demonstrated by the successful exchange programme Germany Close Up, the aim of which is to invite young Jewish Americans to Germany. 
US soldiers and their families have been bringing the American way of life to Germany for more than 70 years, and, on their return to the United States, almost all take a positive view of their host country with them. 
Societal and cultural relations between Germany and the United States are particularly wide-ranging. 
We owe much to the United States. 
It supported Germany and Europe through the Marshall Plan after the Second World War 
In March 2014, Chancellor Merkel received the Anti-Defamation League’s Joseph Prize for Human Rights and in April 2017 the Elie Wiesel Award of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
At a private level too, many American Jews have been rediscovering their family ties to Germany in recent years. 
€1.8 million for project work. 
Germany, along with the OSCE, has committed itself to three specific areas: 
The recent explosions in two arms depots in Serbia and Ukraine in February and March highlighted that 
EU and US 
The European Union and the United States enjoy close ties. 
Regular consultations take place at government level. 
The US and the EU are the two most closely linked economic regions in the world. 
The European Union and the United States enjoy close ties. 
The US and the EU are already the two most closely linked economic regions in the world. 
EU and US flags 
The links between the European Union and the United States have historical roots: America’s decision in 1945 not to withdraw from Europe, as it did after the First World War, provided for an element of stability in Western Europe which enabled it to pursue European integration. 
Since the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration there have been regular consultations between the EU and the US. 
These include annual summits. 
This was underscored once again by the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015. 
This example also highlights another dimension of this complex topic. 
Economic ties and cooperation 
The EU and the US are the most closely connected economic regions in the world. 
The arms used in the attacks were, in part, deactivated arms that had been reactivated for the attacks. 
Mutual investment does even more to increase our economic links than trade alone. 
In late 2014, the EU member states had investments amounting to around 1985 billion US dollars in the US, while US direct investments in the EU totalled 1810 billion US dollars.

Germany, along with the OSCE, has committed itself to all three specific areas: 
Although they account for just over 10 percent of the world’s population, they produce 46 percent of global national product, 50 percent of global economic output, around one third of world trade and one third of all patent registrations. 
In 2015, the transatlantic trade in goods amounted to 619.6 billion US dollars. 
In this project, the Bosnian armed forces also received help with training personnel. 
We are currently running a project in Montenegro that, among other things, focuses on police border security and arsenals. 
These measures may help with tracking down arms trafficking more quickly. 
Finally, as part of an OSCE workshop on deactivating arms, we were able to discuss this topic in depth and encourage an exchange of experiences in this area. 
In addition, there are a host of transatlantic dialogue formats, especially on economic and trade issues, in the spheres of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), Justice and Home Affairs as well as on global challenges such as fighting terrorism, development policy, energy and cyber security. 
They account for 60 percent of direct investments worldwide. 
In order to make even greater use of the potential of the two major economic blocs, 15 rounds of negotiations were held on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between July 2013 and October 2016. 
The agreement is intended to generate more growth and employment on both sides of the Atlantic and would include trade, investment, technical standards and norms. 
The negotiations have been suspended for the time being. 
On 17 January 2017, a joint report by the European Commission and the US Trade Representative was published. It describes the state of the negotiations and states that the negotiations can be concluded if there is sufficient political will. 
It is unclear at present when the negotiations can be resumed under the Trump Administration. 
These negotiations could lead to a new transatlantic economic area for around 800 million people. 
safe storage, combating proliferation and common standards for deactivating SALW. 
the safe storage of ammunition and arms is of great importance for public security on the ground. 
The Federal Republic of Germany paid the record sum of €1.8 million into the OSCE SALW Trust Fund, to support this important work. 
For historical reasons, the Western Balkans still have large stockpiles of conventional arms and, due to their geographical position, they are one of the main sources for illegal arms trafficking in the EU. 
Germany is committed to combating illegal arms trafficking. 
Enhanced cooperation with the OSCE in the field of small arms and light weapons (SALW): 
Above all, we have to make greater use of the creative potential of all young people and greatly expand mobility schemes such as Erasmus. 
By Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth. 
We have to see overcoming the refugee crisis as a joint European task and establish an effective asylum and migration policy based on humanity and solidarity. 
The Federal Foreign Office has trained civilian personnel for international missions since 1999. 
The Center for International Peace Operations (ZIF) has assumed this role since its establishment in 2002. 
Since it was set up, just under 1800 German and international experts have completed ZIF courses for election monitoring and peace missions. 
“The cold wind of renationalisation” 
We are currently witnessing a recalibration of the world in which old patterns of order no longer apply and new lines of conflict keep on emerging – even where we least expect them. 
This is precisely where the social power of culture lies. 
And this is why we are working resolutely to achieve a strategic realignment of cultural relations and education policy. 
Does cultural work stand a realistic chance at all here? 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the use of the death penalty in Belarus 
The person executed killed two people. 
My sympathy extends to them and their families for the suffering brought upon them. 
The German Government rejects the death penalty under all circumstances and will continue to campaign with its partners in the EU for its worldwide abolition. 
I call upon the Belarusian Government to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the country and thus take a step to abolish capital punishment once and for all." 
The person executed was sentenced to death for rape and murdering two women. 
"I am deeply shocked that the death penalty has again been carried out in Belarus. 
I visited Minsk in early March and was able to see for myself that, despite all the restrictions to which civil society in Belarus is subject, there is an active civil society movement against the death penalty and also in Parliament the topic is dealt with in a differentiated manner. 
Yet, the death penalty is an inhumane, cruel and antiquated form of punishment and cannot be justified in any way. 
Belarus is the last European country in which death sentences are handed down and carried out. 
25 years of friendship between Germany and Romania 
Discussion with representatives from civil society 
Roth also held discussions on this issue with representatives from civil society. 
“bridge-builders and role models” 
Conference to mark the 25th anniversary of the Treaty on Friendly Cooperation between Germany and Romania 
“The members of the German minority played and still play a major part as bridge-builders and role models. 
The same is true for the many Romanian citizens who live in Germany and enrich our relations. 
Minister of State Michael Roth and President Klaus Werner Johannis 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (8 May) on an execution in Belarus: 
It has no place in our age and I am shocked that it is being carried out again in the middle of Europe. 
The death penalty was upheld in Belarus in 1996 following a referendum. 
In February 2017, President Lukashenko again spoke out in favour of a timely moratorium. 
The last execution was carried out in April 2017. 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler travels to Mexico 
Ahead of her trip to Mexico, Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (8 May): 
Mexico is an important partner for Germany. 
At societal level, contacts and dialogue are promoted by a wide range of individuals, groups and associations. 
A transatlantic free‑trade agreement could create further momentum. 
Therefore the integration of Europe following the Second World War is both a historic achievement by the Europeans and the result of far‑sighted American foreign policy. 
EU‑US summits 
The last EU‑US summit took place in Brussels on 26 March 2014 (participants: President Obama, European Council President Van Rompuy and European Commission President Barroso, High Representative Ashton, National Security Adviser Rice, US Trade Representative Froman and Commissioner De Gucht). 
The protection of journalists and of human rights defenders is not as effective in practice as it should be. 
In view of the many crises and uncertainties, the support of such an important pro-European partner at the heart of Europe was particularly valuable, emphasised Minister of State Roth. 
The Mexican government is aware of certain problems, that is, the involuntary disappearance of individuals, as well as torture and impunity. 
The Romanian Government had come in for criticism at the beginning of the year on account of controversial anti-corruption legislation. 
Ms Kofler’s trip will also take her to the state of Oaxaca, where she intends to meet with government institutions that are responsible for women’s and indigenous people’s rights, as well as hold discussions with an NGO regarding the freedom of the press. 
Massive protests among large parts of the population were the result. 
Germany and Mexico: bilateral relations 
“Friends must also be able to deal with criticism. 
The Government’s controversial legislation (Emergency Decree no. 13) was the focus of the Minister of State’s talks with Laura Kövesi, head of the Romanian National Anti-corruption Directorate. 
The very good relations between our countries and our close cooperation, also in United Nations bodies, are good reasons for me to travel there during the current Year of Mexico. 
At the same time, I am concerned about certain developments in the country. 
Speech by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth at the Romanian-German Forum’s “Romania and Germany – New Opportunities for Europe?” conference in Bucharest 
I want to conduct an exchange on these issues with the Mexican government, as well as with the parliament, active members of civil society and, of course, human rights organisations. It is my aim to support the efforts of Mexicans to strengthen both the rule of law and the effectiveness of protective mechanisms. 
Criticism of emergency decree on anti-corruption legislation 
On the occasion of Ms Kofler’s trip to Mexico, the Federal Foreign Office will be conducting a human rights seminar in Mexico City that Ms Kofler will attend and that will will focus on the Central American and Caribbean region. 
On his visit to Bucharest, Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth called for greater Romanian commitment in the EU and for the Government to cease its controversial anti-corruption legislation. 
The German minority: 
This daily interaction between Romanians and Germans is clear proof of the fact that diversity is part of Europe’s identity.” 
Roth held frank and intensive talks with Liviu Dragnea, Chairman of the PSD party, which is the strongest ruling party. 
We hope that the Romanian side will dispel all such doubts once and for all”, said Minister of State for Europe following the meeting. 
In his speech at the conference entitled “Romania and Germany – New Opportunities for Europe?”, the Minister of State for Europe emphasised the countries’ very close and friendly relations which he said were not only based on cultural and economic, but also on countless personal ties. 
One key area of exchange are the close societal and cultural relations between the two countries. 
There is a long tradition of exchange programmes for pupils, students, researchers and athletes. 
Two interconnected societies 
Nowadays, Americans and Germans not only visit each other’s countries as tourists; 
the many exchange programmes for pupils, students, artists, researchers and athletes give those taking part a good insight into the culture of their host country. 
In 2006, Chancellor Angela Merkel was the first German leader to deliver a speech before the highest representatives of the American Jewish Committee in Washington. 
In December 2011, Foreign Minister Westerwelle gave the speech honouring Anselm Kiefer on his receipt of the Leo Baeck Medal at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. 
Only then can we work on solutions together. 
This is why we are deliberately creating and working to maintain spheres outside the political realm – such as with difficult partners like Iran or Turkey or with the package of measures of the Eastern Partnership as a response to the Ukraine conflict. 
We are flanking this by expanding our cultural infrastructure abroad. 
Strengthening the social power of culture and education is indispensable for a more peaceful world. 
There aren’t many countries that are as intensively committed to culture and dialogue. 
Is Germany’s integrative role in the world expanding? Are expectations of us rising? 
The signal that this sends shouldn’t be underestimated. 
An example of this is Turkey, where the Goethe-Institut is working together with the Institut Français and Swedish, Dutch and Turkish partners to set up cultural centres in Diyarbakir, Gaziantep and Izmir with the aim of strengthening civil society in Turkey. 
Let’s stick to the example of Turkey. 
The Federal Republic opened the Kulturakademie Tarabya, a wonderful place for creative individuals on the Bosphorus, just a few years ago. 
I’m greatly concerned by developments in Turkey. 
Moreover, with the Kulturakademie in Tarabya and the Turkish-German University, we have inestimably important places and platforms for the social dialogue between our two countries, especially in difficult times such as these. 
What can we do to combat strident nationalism and populism? 
Foreign Minister, your predecessors assessed and promoted culture in different ways. 
What is your position in this regard? 
Cultural relations and education policy are indispensable in terms of promoting the liberalisation of society and offering people prospects for a better future, particularly when politics and traditional diplomacy reach their limits. 
Shouldn’t cultural work abroad seek to realign itself under these circumstances? 
We must improve access to culture and education in order to better understand what preoccupies other societies and what constitutes the new world disorder. 
Seen in this way, cultural policy no longer has a purely aesthetic, but, above all, a social function. 
Thanks to the Members of the German Bundestag, we were able to reverse the negative trend in the current legislative term and to increase funding for cultural relations policy considerably. 
Turkish society has been deeply polarised since the referendum and the room for manoeuvre enjoyed by the press has become vastly diminished; Deniz Yücel’s case unfortunately remains unresolved. 
It is therefore all the more important to maintain this dialogue, even though this is so laborious at the present time. 
This is why we are, with our cultural and educational work, doing what we can to keep the channels of communication open and to support the forces of civil society – from greatly expanding youth exchanges in the course of this year to promoting independent reporting in Turkey to scholarships for persecuted Turkish academics. 
Let’s take a look at Hungary and Poland. 
Values that the Goethe-Institut stands for and conveys are being attacked by the governments in these neighbouring countries. 
That is to say what Willy Brandt once described as “compassion” – the capacity to see and feel life through the eyes of others. 
Nevertheless, we mustn’t overestimate our capacities, but must cooperate with our European partners more intensively. 
This is why the Goethe-Institut’s closer collaboration with other European partners, especially France, is so important. 
How can culture and dialogue strengthen the country’s civil society that is under threat? 
The cold wind of renationalisation that is currently howling through Europe is shaking the very foundations of the European house. 
This trend is highly dangerous. 
Europe is a community of shared values, also culturally speaking. 
What do you hope the planned German Academy in New York will achieve? 
Recent months in particular have shown most clearly that the transatlantic partnership is no longer a matter of course. 
To believe or not to believe: 
The quest for religion’s role in our times 
In 1516, one of his envoys, Girolamo Andrea, returned from a longer sojourn in Germany and the Netherlands to report on growing discontent north of the Alps. 
He told the Pope that in Germany especially, people were just waiting for the right opportunity. 
The training programme is primarily geared to personnel to be deployed in peace missions of the UN, the EU and the OSCE. 
In addition to general training of civilian peace experts, ZIF’s remit also includes recruiting experts for specific missions and looking after them before, during and after the missions, as well as drafting independent analyses and providing advisory services and information on peace operations. 
Initially, it was cities who adopted Protestantism – 
Other movements arose in Switzerland; Calvinism took hold in parts of France, the Netherlands and Scotland. 
We are not holding back in our criticism of the infringement of human rights. 
Moreover, we are looking to cooperate with difficult partners in order to create, using the tools of cultural policy, spheres outside the realm of politics where culture can develop in a protected way. 
In 1534, Henry VIII of England broke with Rome. 
One example was our involvement in the Janadriya Festival in Saudi Arabia as a partner country. 
Emergency Decree no. 13, issued at the end of January, greatly troubled the German Government and many other international partners, affecting their confidence in the Romanian Government’s desire to persevere in its path to success. 
We came in for a great deal of criticism over this, but this is the only way to promote the liberalisation of society. 
Islamic State and the Taliban are attacking our civil and cultural values. 
Culture is certainly a polemic concept here. 
What can be done about this? 
We are currently witnessing a pseudo-religious escalation of conflicts in many parts of the world. 
We must take decisive steps to combat this, and also make it clear through our cultural work that education and differentiation are the only remedy against ideology. 
Quality cinema, good books and excellent music all move me in equal measure. 
My passion for rock and blues, from the Stones to BAP to Lindenberg and Maffay, is quite compatible with my current office at any rate. 
Interview conducted by Rüdiger Schaper. 
In his talks with President Klaus Werner Johannis and Minister of Foreign Affairs Teodor Meleşcanu, Roth called for Romania to have a stronger voice in Europe. 
Slogans such as “roll things back and batten down the hatches” that are being peddled as the solution by populists everywhere on Twitter lead nowhere as the complex issues of our time, from climate change to fair world trade and migration flows, can only be addressed at the European level. 
And this is why we have set up formats such as the Dialogue on Europe in order to connect across Europe and as a rebuttal to populist answers. 
If he had it his way, President Donald Trump would dispense with the promotion of culture entirely. 
Change came breathtakingly fast, even from today’s perspective. 
The states of Hesse and Saxony soon followed. 
It is therefore all the more important that we expand the close dialogue with the US on the topics that concern us, and especially with the tools of cultural relations policy. 
Advised by Wittenberg theologians, various monarchs adopted the new teachings – in Sweden and Finland in 1527, in Denmark and Norway in 1536. 
This right to emigrate became one of the first fundamental rights granted to individuals. 
With Thomas Mann’s house, we will, in the future, have an ideal place to sharpen our focus for one another in the spirit of the great German author. 
Another important element is the planned German Academy at the heart of Manhattan. 
Are there limits, such as who you talk to and do cultural exchanges with and what you put up with – for example in Arab countries that engage in mass violations of human rights and which finance terrorism? 
In my experience, however, more is often achieved for the victims in confidential talks than by statements shouted through megaphones. 
This is, admittedly, often somewhat more challenging than calling for others to gear their actions to our values from the comfort of our armchairs in Berlin. 
Spheres outside the realm of politics is not a description of a state, but is a normative aspiration that we constantly have to renegotiate. 
But, deep down, I still pledge allegiance to rock music. 
Foreign policy, particularly cultural relations policy, isn’t something you can bash into shape with a sledgehammer, nor can it be boiled down to 140 characters. 
This will be an open, transparent building that will bring together innovative minds on both sides of the Atlantic in order to collaborate on relevant topics of the present and future and make them tangible – also with a view to the year of Germany in the USA, which is scheduled for 2018. 
One last question. 
What area of culture do you yourself like best: film, literature or music? 
All over the world, the spread of digital technology and the resulting growth in connectivity are increasingly shaping the way we think and act. 
However, this may also give rise to new uncertainties as well as conflicts between different value and legal systems, and it may strengthen isolationist tendencies. 
The German Government’s international cyber policy is designed to ensure that German interests and ideas concerning cyber security are coordinated and pursued in international organisations, such as the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the OECD and NATO. 
Moreover, we will be supporting at European and national level the development and implementation of the Digital Agenda for Germany. 
Protecting human rights and championing the freedom of the internet 
to guarantee the security of cyberspace and contain threats resulting from the spread of digital technologies, 
The resulting profound social and economic changes open up many opportunities. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the social power of education and culture – and leeway for a peaceful world. 
This is about a cultural policy that facilitates the necessary leeway for culture, education and academia, about a foreign policy of civil societies. 
Many people consider the state of the world to be threatening and peace to be in jeopardy. 
Many culture professionals and academics around the world have got in touch with us via our model and bring their findings to bear in their own societies back at home. 
We must take even greater steps towards achieving genuine cooperation and the formation of cultural teams in Europe. 
Civil society actors in Germany are also working to enable Turkish culture professionals and journalists at risk to continue their work. 
This is why we take a strong stand when European principles are undermined, such as the recent case of the Central European University in Budapest. 
There are also anti‑cultural trends in the US. 
We must not give free rein to preachers of hate waging conflicts under the mantle of cultural or religious struggles. 
It’s about the sound you create. 
cultural and educational work is considered to be a key task across the parliament. 
Anyone who, like ISIS, destroys religious sites and cultural property, wants to rob people of their identity and stand in the way of an open, humane and diverse society. 
Its objectives are: 
International cyber security policy 
For this to happen, we believe that national cyber policy needs to be linked with European and international efforts. 
to safeguard universal human rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of opinion and the press, also on the internet, as well as to ensure responsible use of the internet’s freedom-generating potential, 
and to make the best possible use of, as well as expand, the opportunities afforded by digital technology. 
The priorities for the work of the Federal Foreign Office in these fora are, among others, agreement on standards for good governance, the application of international law, as well as the development of confidence-building measures to enhance cyber security. 
Pope Leo X had been warned. 
It was high time, he said, to take action to prevent a tempest arising against Rome. 
As we all know, events took their course. 
Today, 500 years after Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door in Wittenberg, it is obvious that the Reformation he set in motion has had and continues to have far-reaching theological, cultural and political consequences far beyond Germany’s borders. 
That is why this year’s anniversary of the Reformation is not just a Church event, but a happening with foreign policy dimensions. 
The Reformation played a crucial role in shaping our modern understanding of what constitutes freedom, and what is important with respect to education and social coexistence. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the sentencing of an Indonesian governor for blasphemy 
In the USA, the non-European heartland of the Reformation, we have collaborated with renowned German museums to organise two top-rate touring exhibitions, which have attracted huge numbers of visitors. 
In addition, countless activities are taking place at German embassies and consulates around the world. 
The Federal Foreign Office is providing funding for overseas participants in the 37th Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag in Berlin and Wittenberg. 
– in my home town the words “ora et labora” (pray and work) are inscribed on the door of the “Siemenshaus”, built for an earlier member of the great industrialist family. 
I call on Indonesia’s politicians, society and institutions to continue this tradition. 
Background information: 
The Reformers were in it for the long haul. 
Their repeated calls for cities and villages to establish schools is just one example. 
In so doing, I wish to call to mind Indonesia’s voluntary commitment to acknowledge and promote all rights stemming from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which include the right to freedom of speech and the freedom of religion in particular. 
Lawyers representing Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known in Germany by the name Ahok, have announced their intention to appeal this decision. 
Traces of the Reformation, which started as a theological dispute and became a canonical conflict, can nonetheless still be found in the socio-political realm. 
Now, as then, access to information and the skills needed to use the new media are crucial. 
Luther made deft use of the media revolution of his time, above all the printing of books, pamphlets and images. He responded without delay and in writing to accusations from Rome, and had his own writings and those of his opponents printed and reprinted. 
We have no cause to venerate Luther as a saint, especially in view of his dark side – his anti-Semitism. 
What will remain with us after this anniversary year? 
There are two things that I personally view as the legacy of the Reformation. 
Immediately after the announcement of the ruling, Ahok was taken into custody and removed from office. 
His lawyers have announced their intention to appeal the ruling before the Supreme Court. 
Any such action plan should be country-specific and initially cover the 16 states included in the AU-Germany project. 
On 9 May, the North Jakarta District Court sentenced Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who goes by the name Ahok, to two years’ imprisonment without parole for charges of blasphemy in a surprise ruling. 
They applied a blasphemy paragraph that the UN Human Rights Council has recommended be scrapped or revised on repeated occasions. 
This judgement casts a shadow over Indonesia’s moderate form of Islam, which places an emphasis on the tolerant, pluralistic aspects of the religion. 
Renewed dialogue between Germany and Slovenia 
Firstly, the attitude postulated by the Reformers that everyone should exercise their own faculty of reason without outside guidance (to use the words of the later philosopher Immanuel Kant, who was brought up a Pietist) and to trust in one’s own conscience. 
The entire European Enlightenment owes much to Luther and the other Reformers 
– critical debate with tradition and the public competition of ideas have since been a keystone of political discourse in Europe. 
Without them, there would be no science, no functioning democracy and no open societies. 
Secondly, participation in society and the assumption of responsibility for the greater common good. 
Luther’s own path led him out of the monastery and into the world. 
As the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, a nation that is committed to democracy, religious tolerance and pluralism, the Republic of Indonesia is held in high regard in the Federal Republic and around the world. 
In so doing, the five judges went beyond both the charge brought by the public prosecution office (“spreading hate”) and the requested penalty (a suspended sentence).

The participants in the coordination meeting agreed to these proposals and emphasised that the action plan needed to be based on joint analyses by donors and recipients. 
on the grounds that it could serve as an example of a joint leadership role and as a contribution to the upcoming PoA review conference in 2018. 
Germany and Slovenia have been maintaining diplomatic relations for 25 years. 
To believe or not to believe – we have that freedom. 
They also have very good political and cultural relations. 
Dialogue between Germany and Slovenia 
80% of the world population belongs to one religion or another. 
In my opinion, the religions thus bear a great responsibility for peace and for the cohesion of our societies. 
Gabriel and his Slovenian counterpart signing the anniversary declaration. 
Gabriel stated that relations would be further strengthened in the future. 
They are non-state actors with whom we, as secular governments, would like to work more closely. 
In a joint anniversary declaration, the two Foreign Ministers decided to create a new framework for their bilateral partnership. Every year, Germany and Slovenia will officially meet to discuss bilateral relations. 
This dialogue will be held alternately in Germany and Slovenia. 
Cooperation in Europe 
Gabriel: A desire to build on the excellent relations between Germany and Slovenian © Kjer/photothek.net 
500 years after the Reformation the world is once again in turmoil and pseudo-religious ideologies drive many of the world’s conflicts. 
It is not only bilateral relations that are excellent, Germany and Slovenia also work closely together at European level and in NATO. 
Gabriel stated that Slovenia has demonstrated that it can do both: 
Mediation in Libya: 
Gabriel meets Algerian Foreign Minister Lamamra 
Algeria plays an important role in efforts to mediate in Libya. 
“It is a strong and confident nation state but it is also a strong partner working with the EU in solidarity.” 
Algeria plays an important role in efforts to mediate in Libya. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met his Algerian colleague Lamamra in Berlin to discuss the situation. 
Gabriel … Lamamra … 
Article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the “Tagesspiegel” supplement of 5 May 2017 marking the 37th Evangelischer Kirchentag in Berlin and Wittenberg 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his Algerian counterpart Lamamra 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra in Berlin on Tuesday (9 May). 
Their talks focused on the continuing crisis in Libya. 
Luther’s opposition to the “alternative facts” broadcast by Rome concerning letters of indulgence earning their buyers time off from purgatory just happened to be the trigger. 
In 1517, the movement – for which the groundwork had been laid in many parts of Europe –suddenly spread like wildfire. 
It was not long before the conflagration spread beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. 
Haven for human traffickers and arms smugglers

Wittenberg, Nuremberg, Augsburg, and Brunswick; Riga on the Baltic Sea coast. 
In the wake of the fall of the brutal dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya split into areas under the influence of various rival militias and parts of the army. 
Germany counting on the United Nations 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with UN Special Representative for Libya Martin Kobler 
The international community has been trying for years to stabilise the country. 
Germany is supporting the United Nations in its endeavours to form a viable Government of National Accord in Libya. 
This was the start of the first major globalisation, a religious globalisation which spread in a series of ever higher waves, pulsating out from Europe’s shores to be felt all over the world, especially in what was to become the United States of America. 
Neighbouring countries like Algeria with contacts to all political camps in Libya have an important role to play in the mediation efforts. 
These relations will be further strengthened in the future through a regular dialogue between Germany and Slovenia. 
Anniversary visit on Europe Day 
Europe is affected too 
Gabriel thanked Foreign Minister Lamamra for these mediation efforts and called on all parties involved to continue the dialogue. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel stressed that the two countries are more than just close economic partners. 
“The instability in Libya is a danger for its neighbours, too, and also affects Europe. 
That is why we need to speak with one voice at last,” said Gabriel. 
As one of the largest Western donors, Germany finances numerous humanitarian assistance, reconstruction and stabilisation projects in Libya. 
Together with the EU and the UN, Germany is particularly committed to improving the humanitarian situation for migrants in the country. 
It was ultimately President Woodrow Wilson, the product of a Presbyterian upbringing, who made democracy, human rights and the right of all peoples to self-determination universal values of US foreign policy. 
Within the framework of the EU, Germany and Slovenia are working closely together in the area of refugees and migration in particular. 
Mediation for Libya: 
Gabriel talking to Lamamra 
Gabriel and Lamamra also discussed German-Algerian relations. 
and seek to intensify cultural exchange between the two countries. 
As a son of the Lutheran and once Free Imperial City of Goslar, I can well understand that 
We do this by talking about the fruits of the Reformation with the world and putting them up for debate. 
This idea raises questions about the economisation of life and the fair distribution of revenues, questions that continue to preoccupy us now. 
But to complete the picture it must be noted that Luther and his defenders, as well as his Roman Catholic opponents, differed little from some of today’s users of social media in their fondness for polemic tirades and images to match. 
The fact that Luther dared to set out his own divergent views in a letter to the Pope, and refused to recant in Worms, “unless [he was] convinced by Scripture and plain reason”, marks a turning point in European history as regards freedom, not least freedom of opinion. 
The meeting was held as part of the ongoing AU-Germany project on improved coordination of small arms control measures in the Sahel region. 
Presentation of the AU Master Roadmap 
The African Union presented its Master Roadmap of Practical Steps to Silence the Guns in Africa by the Year 2020. 
During the afternoon session, representatives of the African Union and the Federal Foreign Office suggested that this roadmap be used as a common framework for all activities relating to small arms in the Sahel region. 
The organisers of the meeting also recommended that donors work with the AU, the regional economic associations, regional bodies and regional organisations to draw up an action plan to translate the themes addressed in the AU's roadmap into concrete activities. 
In addition, an action plan would have the advantage of enabling donors to focus on activities in line with their priorities, and thus also of going some way to create a coordinated, common framework. 
Finally, the participants agreed to feed the action plan for the AU Master Roadmap into the UN’s Programme of Action (PoA), 
The meeting was held as part of the ongoing AU-Germany project on enhanced coordination of small arms control measures in the Sahel region. 
This AU-Germany project, which launched in May 2015, aims to coordinate the needs of the countries in the Sahel region more effectively with donor resources. 
It particularly focuses on physical security and stockpile management (PSSM). 
The Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, issued the following statement today (9 May) on the sentencing of the governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known as Ahok, for blasphemy: 
It was with concern that I heard the news about the ruling of 9 May by the North Jakarta District Court against Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment following a blasphemy trial. 
Conservative Muslim groups instituted legal proceedings against Ahok for blasphemy seven months ago. These proceedings were, particularly at the instigation of the small splinter party, Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), flanked by the largest mass protests on the streets of Jakarta since the upheavals of 1998. 
On the previous day, Monday, 8 May 2017, the Government had banned another splinter party, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which was accused of radical Islamistic activities and was also involved in the mass demonstrations. 
Algeria, whose eastern border is shared with Libya, is intensely committed to mediation in the country, which is being torn apart by internal power struggles. 
Islamist terrorist militias like the so-called Islamic State trickled into the country. 
Whole regions of Libya have become a haven for human trafficking rings and arms smugglers. 
In this connection, Gabriel today also met Martin Kobler, the United Nations Special Representative for Libya and a German national. 
Representatives of Libya’s neighbouring countries have arrived in Algiers in recent days to sound out the possibilities for new steps forward with mediation. 
“We are very keen to give young people in your country prospects for the future,” Gabriel said. 
For this reason, Germany will step up support for education institutions in Algeria 
As a result of this, in 2016, a project for the proper and safe storage of arms in Bosnia and Herzegovina was completed after six years. 
One question remains. It concerns the role religion plays in our times. 
As a first step in that direction, I have invited one hundred religious representatives from around the world to Berlin at the end of May in order to talk about the responsibility the religions bear for peace. 
Support for projects: 
Preserving the manuscripts from Timbuktu 
Now they have been saved from destruction, the aim is to conserve the centuries-old Islamic documents. 
© Bergische Universität Wuppertal 
The story was in the news for weeks 
in late 2012, when radical Islamist rebels in Mali were threatening to destroy all the 12th and 13th-century Islamic writings which had until that point been kept in Timbuktu. 
Around 285,000 of the manuscripts, which are included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list, were evacuated to Bamako in a secret rescue operation. 
Now these historical documents need to be preserved and made permanently accessible for research. 
In this way several hundred thousand documents from the old Ahmed Baba Institute were saved – unnoticed by the Jihadists, who had in the meantime established their headquarters in the modern library building. 
Financial support from Germany 
Germany’s help in saving the Timbuktu manuscripts is also substantial in financial terms. 
Germany remains the most important bilateral donor in 2015, thanks to the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office, the Gerda Henkel Foundation and the Jutta Vogel Foundation. 
In the autumn of 2014, Haidara was presented with the German Africa Award by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in recognition of these efforts. 
On the 25th anniversary of bilateral relations, Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Slovenian counterpart Karl Erjavec renewed the dialogue between Germany and Slovenia. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel welcomed his Slovenian counterpart Karl Erjavec to the Federal Foreign Office on Tuesday (9 May). 
This meeting was held on a special occasion, as in 2017, Germany and Slovenia are celebrating 25 years of bilateral relations. 
9 May is Europe Day, but this was not the only reason why the visit of Slovenian Foreign Minister Karl Erjovac today marked a special occasion. 
There is also broad agreement between the two countries on the situation in the Western Balkans and Germany, Sigmar Gabriel said, could still learn a lot from Slovenia's familiarity with the region. 
Archiving and digitising the manuscripts 
International experts are helping to save and preserve the manuscripts in Bamako. 
More than half of the international aid given to SAVAMA-DCI, an NGO which represents the overwhelming majority of the manuscript-owning families of Timbuktu, comes from Germany. 
The Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures of the University of Hamburg coordinates the use of Germany’s contribution under the leadership of Dr Dimitry Bondarev. 
SAVAMA is collaborating with the University of Hamburg to archive the manuscripts and catalogue them. 
Other donors and technical partners are helping to digitise the manuscripts before they are sent back to where they belong. 
Coordination and collaboration between the partners involved has improved tremendously since the project began. 
The German Embassy in Bamako coordinates a network to this end and regularly invites all partners to meetings. 
The manuscripts from Timbuktu, considered part of world heritage by UNESCO, are testament to a rich literary tradition and reflect the Arab world’s great scientific, philosophical and theological knowledge. 
The majority of the manuscripts come from the 12th and 13th centuries. 
They were kept in Timbuktu until the north of Mali was occupied by Islamists. 
A complicated assistance mission at the end of 2012 managed to save the manuscripts from the threat of imminent destruction by the Islamist rebels. 
25 years of diplomatic relations: Foreign Ministers launch a dialogue between Germany and Slovenia 
The Foreign Ministers of Germany and Slovenia met in Berlin today (9 May) to celebrate 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. 
The Malian Government, civil society, multilateral and bilateral partners, foundations and research institutes have since jointly developed a strategy designed to reconcile the interests of the Malian owners with those of international research. 
Commenting on this, Foreign Minister Gabriel said: 
Since gaining independence 26 years ago, Slovenia has been a true success story. 
The joint statement in full: 
25 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Slovenia have closer political, economic and cultural ties than ever before. 
The Ambassadors of the Federal Republic of Germany in Ljubljana and of the Republic of Slovenia in Berlin will act as coordinators. 
The Prince’s right to choose his religion (ius reformandi) soon gave rise to its pendant, his subject’s right to emigrate should he refuse to convert (ius emigrandi). 
In 1904, Max Weber published the now classic description of a religiously driven business ethic as an “iron cage” which humanity had erected around itself. 
At a time when the world is being redefined, when traditional categories have ceased to apply and authoritarianism seems more popular than ever, we therefore have to take a fresh look at the questions of religion and order, of informed choice and individual responsibility which are inseparably linked to the Reformation. 
The London Economist recently tried, tongue-in-cheek British style, to highlight the fruits of the Reformation as they can be seen in the present day. 
They can be seen, it was claimed, in the allegedly modest dress and office decor of some German politicians, in our religious separation of rubbish, and the lasting success of a furniture business from – of course – Lutheran Sweden. They can be seen in the fact that Germany has the second-largest book market in the world and in our dislike of running up. All of these tendencies stem, it suggested, from Luther and Calvin. 
But the half a millennium which now separates us from Luther is enough to guard us from the naive belief that European intellectual history progressed along a neatly linear course. 
Education for all as a foundation for living self-determined lives and as a prerequisite for the lasting success of democracy has been on the political agenda ever since and there it will remain. 
His house, his home town of Wittenberg became a hub of European thought, visited by travellers from all over. 
He communicated with scholars, with city officials and with princes about relief funds for the poor, about converting monastery buildings into schools and about holding services in the German vernacular. 
Our joined-up way of thinking about society as a whole, and this schooling of our own conscience, are the result of a very long development which was given a significant jolt by the events of 1517. 
As well as bequeathing us with an obviously conspicuous delight in separating our rubbish, it has endowed us above all with a vibrant civic spirit, a public education system and a natural sense of consideration for those who are weaker and more in need than ourselves. 
But secularisation has not led to the disappearance of religion. Religion has great political influence and this is still growing, especially outside Europe. 
It is thus more important than ever to stand firm and argue for what we are firmly convinced is right. 
They will also be in charge of jointly determining which issues both sides wish to focus and make progress on. 
It will serve as a forum for bilateral issues, as well as for discussing political cooperation in Europe and for conducting an exchange on international issues. 
It will be held every year, with the venue alternating between Germany and Slovenia. The ministers responsible for European policy will be in charge of organising the event. 
These can by mutual agreement be adapted and expanded on at any time. 
To mark this anniversary, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Slovene Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec signed an agreement that establishes a German-Slovene dialogue. 
With the path it has chosen, Slovenia has demonstrated it can be both: 
a strong and confident nation state, as well as a strong partner working with the European Union in solidarity. 
Professor Uli Barth lecturing during the OPCW course at Bergische Universität Wuppertal 
The following short film gives an overview of the course: 
Germany has a particularly strong chemical industry – it is the third largest importer and one of the largest exporters of chemical and pharmaceutical products in the world. As such, it aims to promote this scientific exchange. Since 2009, it has been offering, in cooperation with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), courses on chemical safety management, titled Wuppertal Annual Course of Loss Prevention and Safety Promotion in the Chemical Process Industries. 
Other ministries, as well as bilateral actors and institutions can be included in the German-Slovene Dialogue on issues in which they are involved. 
Today is a special day for German-Slovene relations, because we are celebrating an anniversary – 25 years of diplomatic ties. 
Joint declaration of intent on the German-Slovene Dialogue, marking the 25th anniversary of bilateral relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Slovenia 
The Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia are taking this opportunity to provide a new framework for their bilateral partnership, by creating the German-Slovene Dialogue. 
The Dialogue is intended to be a new institutional pillar of German-Slovene relations. It aims to promote mutually beneficial cooperation in selected areas, as well as to deepen the exchange of information and coordination between the two governments. 
The Dialogue is designed to be conducted in a spirit of partnership, and to be inclusive. 
Courses on chemical safety management 
Under Article XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the 192 States Parties seek to promote the exchange of scientific and technical information for the production, processing or use of chemicals for purposes not prohibited under the Convention. 
The courses are funded by the Federal Foreign Office, and the OPCW helps with the selection each year of 24 course participants, who come from Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Caribbean. 
The courses provide knowledge about, skills for and insight into long‑term chemical safety management. This, among other things, helps minimise the risk of dangerous chemicals falling into the hands of non‑state actors, who may use these for prohibited purposes, including terrorism. 
Minister of State Böhmer comments on the idea of cooperatives being inscribed on UNESCO’s “Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage” 
Minister of State Böhmer commented: 
For the first time ever, UNESCO has recognised an element nominated by Germany as an intangible cultural heritage. 
With regard to the future of cooperatives, Böhmer stated:

It is particularly in the area of development cooperation that the idea of cooperatives offers successful models that are both economically and politically sustainable.

“kulturweit” is an international volunteer programme devoted to cultural relations and education policy and is aimed at everyone aged between 18 and 26. 
The programme gives young people a tangible and practical insight into their global responsibility. 
They work in cultural and educational institutions across the world as part of the volunteer service of the German Commission for UNESCO. 
The “idea and practice of organising shared interests in cooperatives” was inscribed in UNESCO’s “Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage” in Addis Ababa at the end of 2016. 
Through their commitment, “kulturweit” volunteers help to create scope for dialogue, trust and mutual understanding in over 70 countries around the world. 
Educational and financial support 
All “kulturweit” volunteers do a voluntary social year abroad, during which they receive educational and financial support. 
Böhmer explained that cooperatives are a modern, forward-looking form of organisation that involves a great deal of creativity, flexibility and ability to innovate. 
By taking part in an international volunteer programme, the young people expand their perspective on global connections and different lifestyles and ways of working. 
It was instituted in 2008 to raise awareness all over the world of elements of intangible cultural heritage and to help people understand how varied cultural forms of expression can be. 
These new experiences and enhanced skills enable them to work for more open-mindedness in German society when they return home. 
The programme, which has sent out over 2700 volunteers since 2009, has been awarded the QUIFD (Agency for Quality in Volunteer Services) quality seal. 
Offering perspectives 
“kulturweit” promotes learning and gives the volunteers long-term perspectives. 
Thanks to further training on how to organise seminars, on the world heritage and on education for sustainable development which goes far beyond the scope of the volunteer service, “kulturweit” alumni are part of a strong network which self-confidently raises issues and shapes developments.

Venice: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opens the German Pavilion at the International Art Exhibition. 
Every second year, one of the world’s major international art exhibitions is held in Venice. 
This year’s pavilion was designed by artist Anne Imhof. 
A key forum for contemporary art 
© Inga Kjer / photothek.net 
This is the 57th time that artists from all over the world have gathered in Venice for the International Art Exhibition. 
Every second year since 1895 the international art scene has assembled in the Giardini di Castello. 
Over the years, the oldest biennial art festival in the world has become one of the most important international forums for contemporary art. 
The exhibition is organised around 85 country pavilions designed by artists. 
In addition, there is an international exhibition space for which work is selected by the curators. 
On 11 May 2017, Minister of State Maria Böhmer will officially hand over the documents of the inscription of the “idea and practice of organising shared interests in cooperatives” on UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage to Deutsche Hermann-Schulze-Delitzsch-Gesellschaft e.V. (the German Hermann-Schulze-Delitzsch Society) and Deutsche Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen-Gesellschaft e.V. (the German Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen Society) in Berlin. 
As someone who comes from Rhineland-Palatinate, I am particularly delighted, as Friedrich-Wilhelm Raiffeisen, one of the founding fathers of the cooperative idea, came from my Land. 
That there are some 800 million people in over 100 countries that are organised in cooperatives only goes to show the appeal of an idea that brings people together from various countries. 
I am convinced that the idea of cooperatives and the values that come with it are a particularly valuable cultural heritage and have a positive effect on our society. Far beyond this, the idea is of great practical importance worldwide because it encourages us all to take responsibility when dealing with today’s challenges. 
The “Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage” includes elements such as music, dance, theatre, oral traditions, customs, festivals and handicrafts. 
Germany has participated in the Biennale from the outset, and has had its own pavilion since 1909. This was constructed by the Venetian architect Daniele Donghi. 
Art as an invitation to engage in dialogue 
Gabriel considers it important that national entries to the Art Exhibition be viewed as an invitation to engage in dialogue: 
“Artistic freedom must not be reduced to a national package.” 
Gabriel then attended the performance by Anne Imhof in the German pavilion. 
The exhibitions can be visited in Venice until 26 November. 
“Giving art space to breathe”

Foreign Minister Gabriel with Susanne Pfeffer, the curator of the German Pavilion 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opened the German Pavilion today. 
We have to ensure that art is given space to breathe and thrive, Gabriel stressed in his opening address. 
Artistic freedom thus has to be protected – it is only a small step from curbing artistic freedom to ignorance and intolerance. 
He noted that this is also the approach taken by Germany’s cultural relations and education policy – the focus is not on showcasing national art but on the opportunities for exchange and dialogue that art opens up. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opened the German Pavilion at the International Art Exhibition in Venice on Wednesday (10 May). 
Gabriel noted that the fine arts are an integral part of any democracy, along with science, culture and education.

This rescue operation was the work of librarian Abdel Kader Haidara from Timbuktu. 
With many brave helpers, he secretly organised the transport of the manuscripts to Bamako, with financial support from the Federal Foreign Office.

An International Strategy Conference held in the Federal Foreign Office in June 2014 was instrumental in this regard. 
Since then, manuscript experts from Mali and Hamburg have been working to preserve and restore the documents and to ensure permanent access to them for research purposes. 
The Directorate-General is responsible for political relations with 110 states in the Near and Middle East, Africa and Latin America. 
None of the major challenges facing our world, for instance climate protection, the global food supply or clean seas, can be tackled without them. 
The Directorate-General’s work thus focuses on the following areas: 
at a political level, supporting weak or fragile states, many of which border Europe, so that they can develop into more stable states that are less likely to fail or to turn into areas with no rule of law 
cultivating and expanding political, economic, academic, scientific, cultural and social relations with all countries in these regions. 
Germany acts both independently and as part of the European Union to maintain bilateral relations. 
Germany and the European Union also support the United Nations and regional organisations (for example, the African Union, MERCOSUR in South America, the Arab League, etc.). 
We rely on effective multilateralism so that the largest regions in the world can work together efficiently. 
Israeli-German cyber dialogue at the Federal Foreign Office 
The fundamental principles of a values-based foreign policy form an immutable basis and influence all foreign policy decisions. 
Delegations from Israel and Germany are meeting at the Federal Foreign for the first time today (11 May) for a dialogue on issues relating to international cyber policy and cyber security. 
Both sides agreed that,

Their discussions will focus on a presentation of the two countries’ cyber security architectures as well as a comprehensive exchange of information and views on current issues and developments in cyber diplomacy and international cyber policy. 
extending cooperation with emerging economies, strengthening mutual trust and reliability and working with these countries to establish rules to ensure orderly international relations 
Both sides will hold discussions today on how best to continue this dialogue. 
However, these regions are also home to countries whose development is at a critical stage, as well as a number of unstable or fragile states and most of the trouble spots in today’s world. 
“kulturweit” international cultural volunteer programme 
With its “kulturweit” (Bridging Cultures) volunteer programme, the Federal Foreign Office seeks to foster young people’s intercultural skills and encourage a world-minded outlook. 
Directorate-General for Asia and the Pacific 
“kulturweiter” alumni association 
There are two rounds of applications a year, in April and November. 
China and Asia in general are becoming increasingly more important for Germany and Europe, both economically and politically. 
As the result of an initiative by alumni, the association “kulturweiter” was set up in 2014, enabling former volunteers to actively network and develop and realise their own project ideas. 
Whether as assistants in German lessons at the European School in Tbilisi, in the Cultural Programme Division at the Goethe-Institut in Hanoi or in the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Information Centre in Bogotá, “kulturweit” volunteers spend either six months or a year working in countries in the global south, eastern Europe or the CIS, with support from the Federal Foreign Office.

Germany should build on existing partnerships in Asia and should enter into new agreements. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel’s speech at the German Asia-Pacific Business Association in Hamburg: 
“Asia is and remains a crucial region for the future of both Germany and Europe” (24 March 2017).

Germany must therefore intensify its relations with Asia and shape them more strategically in order to do even greater justice to the ever-growing importance of this region, with its population of over four billion and its rapidly expanding markets. 
Today more than ever, Europe and Germany need reliable partners in the world. 
Economic cooperation is a crucial area, i.e. reliable rules should be laid down for free and fair trade to create new jobs in Germany and Asia while respecting social standards. 
In addition, Germany wants to bolster conflict prevention in this region and support regional institutions and multilateralism. 
The goals of the Directorate-General for Asia and the Pacific are to 
improve coherence in Germany's policy on Asia through better coordination 
build up contacts with Asian partners at all levels 
enhance expertise on this crucial continent.

“We hope, of course, that others will follow our example,” Gabriel said in London. 
Stabilising and strengthening state structures 
The conference did not, however, focus exclusively on addressing the current severe humanitarian crisis. It also looked at ways to stabilise the country in the long term.

Rebuilding the country is still being hampered by terrorism and violence. Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved since the last conference on Somalia in London five years ago. 
In 2017, Germany has doubled its assistance to Somalia, to 140 million euros. 
Only recently, Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Mogadishu and Baidoa to get a first-hand impression of developments there. 
Now, it is also up to the international community to join the aid effort: 
The continuing drought is making the crisis even worse for many. 
Top priorities in this respect are improving national security, strengthening state structures and promoting the country’s economic development. 
That is why, under the co-chairmanship of the United Kingdom, the United Nations and the Somali Government, the international community met today to discuss further support for Somalia. 
Digitalisation brings opportunities for societies as a whole, but it also brings risks – in the sphere of foreign policy as elsewhere. 
Analogue and digital foreign policy: German-Israeli consultations on cyber policy in the Federal Foreign Office 
The world is getting ever smaller as digital technology continues to spread. 
Current issues and developments in cyber diplomacy and international cyber policy were also discussed. 
The talks focused on the cyber security architecture of the two states. 
Ambassador Thomas Fitschen, Director for the United Nations, International Cyber Policy and Counterterrorism, headed the German delegation. 
“Israel and Germany are already liaising closely with regard to strengthening national and international cyber security.

“In view of the diversity and intensity of the threats in cyberspace currently faced by our countries, it is vitally important that we cooperate closely in the interests of our countries’ national security and, above all, with the protection of our critical infrastructures in mind,” the two sides agreed. 
This also includes the opportunities arising in both countries’ markets for security solutions developed in Israel and Germany”. 
And of course I would like to give a special thanks to our artist. 
Delegations from Israel and Germany met at the Federal Foreign Office for the first time today (11 May) for a dialogue on issues relating to international cyber policy and cyber security. 
These three regions include emerging economies such as Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa, as well as many other countries that will help shape a new global order. 
Simultaneous and sometimes prolonged crises are posing an ever greater challenge to foreign policy. 
Germany regularly coordinates its policy with its EU partners and with the European External Action Service. 
Germany’s efforts are driven by our desire to help make democracy and the rule of law a reality throughout the world. 
and 11 divisions. 
It is a wonderful opportunity 
to open the Pavilion and show 
The Pavilion itself echoes back to 
a difficult period in Germany and 
focusing on the very opposite. 
keeps people together or indeed drives them apart. 
is now being opened with a performance 
to be here. 
Thank you so much, Anne Imhof, that you put so much energy and creativity into this project and presented us with something so intriguing, thought-provoking and exciting. 
So we are all waiting with bated breath to see what will be unveiled. 
I will limit myself to just a few things that must be said about where we find ourselves. 
We are standing today in front of the German Pavilion at the Giardini di Castello, an artistic focal point. 
A place that, if we take a step back, will allow us to take a break from our busy everyday lives. 
However, despite its uniqueness, this place is not an isolated oasis. 
The art we find here did not arrive vacuum-packed but is rooted in a real political context. 
And this is reflected not just in Anne Imhof’s work but in all works that help us to better understand our society and its centres of power. 
Artists give us the opportunity to see things from a different perspective. 
These echoes can be found in the building itself. 
But this building no longer feels threatening today. 
Its massive columns are framed by Anne Imhof’s glass creation. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel was recently in Somalia. 
Millions of people there are at risk of starvation. 
The situation on the ground is catastrophic. 
And they stand on a base of more than seventy years’ freedom in Europe. 
The claim to absolute truth made by a national or even nationalistic understanding of art can still be clearly seen in the imposing façade of this pavilion. 
An understanding of art that confines and excludes. 
Hundreds of thousands of families are living in poverty. 
Gabriel decided to double aid from Germany. 
And we are experiencing a revival of such a mentality today. 
“We hope, of course, that others will follow our example. 
It is perhaps not so prevalent in our art, but it colours our society, public opinion and certainly also our politics. 
Populists are throwing slogans about that would have us believe that individual states can recoup their lost glory by cutting themselves off from an interlinked Europe and a globalised world. 
We cannot find solutions by insisting there is only one right way for culture. 
Letting the majority decide on a narrow definition of culture is only one small step away from cultural ignorance or even intolerance. 
You cannot have a successful dialogue on culture if you start by taking provocative and narrow positions. 
I must admit that my political understanding of the definition of culture is very straightforward: 
“Arts and sciences, research and teaching shall be free”. 
I think that we Germans are lucky that we can have an open debate about our cultural identity. 
That is because we had parents and grandparents that had a good understanding of our cultural identity. 
At the Somalia Conference in London, Gabriel is now pushing for more assistance: 
Unlike a few years ago, the threat of famine is foreseeable this time - it isn't happening overnight or unexpectedly." 
The international community is thus called upon to do something about it." 
Our constitution clearly sets us a political mission to protect and support the freedom of art. 
And it is a subject that artists also explore. 
Total freedom is needed to work with such artistic concepts. 
It is not by chance that Anne Imhof challenges preconceived notions of borders and exclusions in her art, or that she is willing to work in difficult spaces such as the German Pavilion here in Venice. 
We follow this very approach in our cultural and education policy at the Federal Foreign Office. 
And I am taking the opportunity to say this at the opening of our “national” Pavilion here in Venice. 
This Pavilion is no longer just a place to glorify our national art, just like our cultural and education policy no longer enshrines such an attitude. 
It is not a narrowing of vision to the national level, rather, it is an invitation to communicate openly and enter into a dialogue. 
That is why I believe that Anne Imhof’s work will have a great effect on us here and now. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Development Minister Müller had issued an appeal at the beginning of April in the form of the Berlin Humanitarian Call, urging that action be taken before time runs out. 
“We have now collected 55 percent of the funds that are needed to combat the food crisis in Somalia and the Horn of Africa”, he stated, adding that this meant that 45 percent had yet to be raised. 
Last-minute effort to avert famine: 
Some 40 countries and international organisations convened in London on Thursday (11 May) to discuss aid for Somalia. 
In addition to combating the current threat of famine, the aim of long-term stabilisation of the country was also discussed. 
The urgent appeal by UN Secretary-General António Guterres has been heard, Foreign Minister Gabriel said at the start of the conference: 
“We have meanwhile collected 55% of the funds that are needed to combat the food crisis in Somalia and the Horn of Africa .... 
However, this also means we are still missing 45%,” he then added. 
The situation in the country is dramatic, Gabriel said. 
The people are suffering from the effects of war and civil war. 
In 2017, Germany has already doubled its humanitarian aid for Somalia, to 140 million euros. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross operates a medical centre in Lebanon for the treatment of complicated war wounds. 
With determined concentration, Maria reaches for the wooden blocks. 
Her arm is bandaged, and her small fingers are attached to a wire frame with elastic bands. 
Very slowly, she manages to make and control her first movements. 
The physiotherapist praises the five-year-old Syrian girl. 
She turns around to her mother, full of pride. 
The clinic is run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), for which Germany is one of the most important donors. 
The facility in Tripoli treats only complicated war wounds, like that of Maria. 
The little girl was on the roof of her house in Aleppo when it was hit by an air strike of the Syrian regime and its allies. 
A piece of shrapnel hit Maria’s right arm. 
“It was almost completely severed,” her mother Samira Hussein Mohammed says. 
Maria had two operations in Syria. Although her arm was attached to her body, it hung lifeless and crippled at her side. 
Maria did not want to go outside any more. The other children were afraid of her. 
“The situation was so bad that I wanted to sell my own kidney to pay for a new operation for Maria.” 
Only after fleeing to Lebanon did Samira learn that Maria could be treated at the WTTC. Not only would her treatment be free, but the family would even receive a small stipend to help tide it over during the treatment, which takes several months. 
Treatment of war wounds is something the ICRC is specialised in. 
Being able to live as healthy and independent a life as possible is important not only for every single wounded person, but also for the society and future of a country. 
The number of Syrians who are no longer capable of this is also so high because “restricting access to medical care in Syria is increasingly being used as a weapon,” Carboni explains. 
The Federal Foreign Office is therefore supporting efforts to strengthen the police force in order to make the population feel safer. 
At the same time, the Max Planck Foundation, which is supported by the Federal Foreign Office, is helping to strengthen local initiatives and accountability through the establishment of a federal state. 
The reintegration of former fighters into Somali society is another important task. 
With German support, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is able to prepare up to 1000 former soldiers for a life in peace each year. 
On the margins of the conference, Foreign Minister Gabriel met with UN Secretary-General António Guterres, to whom he reiterated his support for the work of the United Nations with regard to Somalia. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel congratulates Anne Imhof and Franz Erhard Walther 
Anne Imhof and Franz Erhard Walther from Fulda win Golden Lions at this year’s Venice Art Biennale. 
To mark this, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement: 
I would like to sincerely congratulate Anne Imhof and Franz Erhard Walther on their Golden Lions. 
Federal Government condemns new North Korean missile test 
Bashira Arash, who is from the Syrian city of Homs, was injured while trying to take shelter during a bombing raid. 
This is also the story of Bashira Arash from the Syrian city of Homs. 
The 56-year-old widow was injured while trying to escape during a bombing raid. 
She was blinded by the dust that filled the air. 
The German Pavilion in Venice is a crucial part of our cultural relations policy. 
She has had five operations so far at the WTTC. 
A metal frame is implanted in her arm. 
But she can move it again, and the pain is almost completely gone. 
Her work helps us to shed light on social spaces and their centres of power. 
It gives us an opportunity to see things from a different perspective by appealing to the whole individual, their thoughts and feelings. 
“And I love being independent.” 
Franz Erhard Walther and Anne Imhof have won the two most important prizes at this year’s Venice Art Biennale. 
I am delighted to be able to be in Venice with you all today to open the German Pavilion at this year’s Art Biennale. 
Germany is its largest donor. 
The German Pavilion designed by the Frankfurt artist Anne Imhof was awarded the Golden Lion for best national participation. 
Franz Erhard Walther from Fulda was awarded the Golden Lion as best artist. 
The pavilion is curated by Susanne Pfeffer, director of the Museum Fridericianum in Kassel. 
A great deal has already been written about it, which is surely a good sign. 
Last night North Korea evidently tested another ballistic missile. 
The conceptual artist Franz Erhard Walther (77) is exhibiting a large-scale textile work. 
She grabbed Maria and ran to the hospital. 
The last time the German Pavilion won the Golden Lion was in 2011, when Christoph Schlingensief was awarded the prize posthumously. 
In 2013, the German-British artist Tino Sehgal was awarded the Golden Lion as best artist. 
Main exhibition entitled “Viva Arte Viva” 
“We also want to give patients back hope in their future,” says the British surgeon Paul Ley, who has operated on Maria several times. 
The 57th Art Biennale opened to the public on Saturday. 
“Our goal is for them to be able to live productive and independent lives.” 
Half a million visitors are expected to go to one of the most important exhibitions of contemporary art until 26 November. 
An understanding, or should I say a misguided understanding, based on the tenet that art must, above all, demonstrate our national superiority over the art forms of our neighbouring countries. 
The Deauville Partnership: 
Supporting change in the Arab world 
Misplaced superiority and arrogance instead of dialogue, an exchange of ideas and open communication. 
The G8 launched the Deauville Partnership at its May 2011 summit in France in response to the “Arab Spring”. 
The main exhibition entitled “Viva Arte Viva” (long live art) is curated by Christine Macel from France. 
Around 120 artists from 51 countries are showing their works, which include three German artists alongside Franz Erhard Walther. 
In addition to the main exhibition, more than 80 national pavilions are presenting their countries’ contributions. 
The aim of the partnership is to promote political reform in the countries in transition – Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and Yemen – and to create an economic framework conducive to sustainable, inclusive growth. 
If you read it, you can see and understand everything you need to know about how to live in a sensible, peaceful and culturally open manner, not just within your own country but also in your relations with all other nations in the world. 
A space that teaches us about different narratives, reflects the stories, pictures and attitudes passed down the generations, and encourages us to talk about what has shaped us and what challenges we are facing in our societies. 
From what I have seen of her work so far, she does not lay claim to creating “the right art” and she will not simplify a complex world for us. 
“I was willing to sell my own kidney to pay for a new operation for Maria” – Maria’s mother, Samira 
“If you want, at some point, to rebuild a country, then you will need active people who are capable of doing so,” Fabrizio Carboni says, who is Head of the ICRC Delegation in Lebanon. 
The ICRC is doing its best to get medical supplies and equipment needed for operations to clinics in war-torn areas. 
Still, injured persons can often receive only limited care in field hospitals. 
This in turn has led to many bone infections, badly performed amputations, incompletely healed fractures and constant pain. 
At the same time it must be clear that this conflict cannot be contained and ultimately resolved by military means, but only through diplomatic channels. 
“I was afraid I would need an amputation and that I would lose a part of my body” 
After an operation in Homs, the arm became infected and stiffened up completely. 
There was no way she could return to her job of knitting in a small workshop. 
“I can hardly wait to get back to knitting,” she says. 
The MENA Transition Fund is the Deauville Partnership’s financing instrument. 
I am delighted by the courage shown by the jury, the artists and Susanne Pfeffer, the curator of our pavilion, in developing this concept and in awarding these prizes. 
We condemn this new violation of international law in the strongest possible terms and, along with our partners, urgently call upon the regime in North Korea to abandon its aggressive collision course and to go back to respecting international norms. 
Three days ago, I had the honour of opening the pavilion and attending the “Faust” performance devised by Anne Imhof. 
And now I wish for us all – despite all these ruminations – to simply enjoy this amazing exhibition here in Venice. 
This was announced by the jury in Venice on Saturday. 
In the German Pavilion, the Frankfurt artist Anne Imhof (39) is staging the approximately five-hour long “Faust” performance. 
It is supported primarily by the G7 partners (envisaged capitalisation: 250 million US dollars) and serves to back reform projects in the six target countries. 
He is known for creating art which allows the observer to take part. 
To date, 77 projects with total funding of 220 million US dollars have been implemented or launched. 
I would like to thank Susanne Pfeffer, our curator, who had overall responsibility for the pavilion, the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, the intermediary organisation which organises our contribution at the Biennale, the many patrons and sponsors who helped us make possible this year’s presentation and, most especially, the performers who took part in “Faust”. 
The United Nations Security Council is in agreement and has emphasised on several occasions that the international community is determined to work together to confront the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapon and missile programme. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the arrest of Bahá’is in Iran 
The Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, today (12 May) issued the following statement on the detention of leading members of the Bahá’i faith in Iran: 
The seven leading members of the Iranian Bahá’i community have now spent nine years in jail. 
There must be an end to the persecution of the Bahá’is and other religious minorities on account of their faith. 
Such measures violate the right to freedom of religion or belief, a right which Iran has undertaken to protect and respect by signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Their arrest and conviction completely disregarded fundamental rule of law principles. 
The sentences originally imposed on the leading members of the Bahá’i faith were reduced to ten years, a term which the detainees have now served almost in full. 
The seven members of the ad hoc Bahá’i leadership committee were arrested in spring 2008. In August 2010, having been held without charge for over two years in Tehran’s Evin Prison, they were sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment each. 
The Biennale has given awards to two artists who invite us in very different ways to reflect on the limits and possibilities of art and society and integrate the viewer into their works of art. 
With help from her physiotherapist, Maria (age 5) from Aleppo in Syria is re-learning to move her hand. She has had several operations and a nerve transfer. 
It is a small miracle that Maria can move her right arm at all, especially her fingers. She owes this to the highly specialised doctors at the Weapons Traumatology and Training Center (WTTC) in the Lebanese city of Tripoli. 
The aid organisation is supported with funds from the humanitarian aid budget of the Federal Foreign Office. 
As part of the German government’s wide-ranging humanitarian aid efforts in the region, more than 150 million euros have been made available since 2012 for such aid in Lebanon alone. 
As a result, she did not see the street light standard coming as it fell on her, breaking her arm. 
“I was truly desperate, because I was afraid I would need an amputation, and that I would lose a part of my body,” Bashira says. 
“It’s part of who I am. I love my job,” she continues, while laughing. 
Against this background, I call upon the Iranian judiciary to finally quash these sentences and to release the Bahá’is without delay, along with all other prisoners held on account of their religious beliefs. 
In late 2015 it was announced that the sentences had been reduced to 10 years. 
To date the prisoners have not been granted early release on parole after having completed half their sentence, a move which would be possible under Iranian law. 
She was injured 18 months ago. 
The project is financed exclusively with special funds from the German Bundestag. 
The event is open to the press. 
This process is based on the OSCE’s Berlin Declaration of 2004. 
In this document, the OSCE States acknowledged the threat to stability and security posed by anti-Semitism in the OSCE region and pledged to take countermeasures in close cooperation with civil society. 
Important regional partners (Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates) are to be involved and coordination with international financial institutions (e.g. International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) is to be improved. 
Numerous meetings at ministerial and senior officials level have taken place since 2011, as well as a number of high-level conferences devoted to issues such as good governance, promoting civil society, creating employment, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, inclusive growth and empowering women. 
In May 2015, the G7 and the Deauville partner countries adopted the Deauville Compact on Economic Governance drawn up by the German chairmanship. 
The Compact contains a comprehensive catalogue of recommendations on socio-economic reforms and has become a main element of the Deauville Partnership. 
Italy, which is chairing the Deauville Partnership in 2017, has made the development of human capital in the target countries the focus of its agenda. 
Ms Pfeffer, Ms Imhof, Members of the German Bundestag, My dear colleague, Ms Grütters, Ms Seiler-Albring, Mr Grätz, Ladies and gentlemen, 
First and foremost, Ms Pfeffer who curated the German Pavilion this year. 
Countless helpers have worked hard for months in the planning and execution of this event. 
I would also like to extend our warmest thanks to our many sponsors, friends and partners. 
We at the Federal Foreign Office, as part of the Government, with the full support of our Parliament, have played our role, but it would simply not have been possible without our sponsors. 
You are certainly very intrigued to see what Ms Pfeffer and Ms Imhof will be presenting today after working so long and hard on this. 
I think we will be struck by the visual power and artistic depth that have been harnessed into the various elements of this work. 
For example, for those of us involved in politics, this can serve as a wake-up call, remind us of things that we might not notice otherwise. 
A building that cannot hide the fact that it became a victim of National Socialist ideological zeal. 
Yet the past still resonates in the building. 
It is part of this space that we are visiting and that we are interpreting in a new way in this performance. 
Such an understanding invites a narrow focus on the nation. 
It sets borders, first in our minds, but ultimately between individuals, societies and countries. 
We can see that here in Europe, there is a tendency today to take the facile nationalistic approach and to attempt to find simple solutions to complex problems. 
In my opinion, if we want to avoid such mistakes, we must ensure that our political, social and artistic horizons that Europe broadened after the Second World War do not shrink back to hem us into our own little nations. 
Or that “our” cultural standards are better than “theirs”. 
If we refer to individual countries as “cultural nations”, we are putting them in a false position of superiority. 
This is what it says in Article 5 of the German Basic Law, our constitution. 
This is reflected in the first 20 articles of our constitution. 
We should thank all those who drew the right conclusions from buildings such as this one. 
Article 5 gives politics a clear mandate, i.e. we must not set limits to art. 
Christine Macel, curator of this year’s main art exhibition at the Biennale, stresses in her project description that “art is the ultimate ground for reflection, individual expression, freedom and for fundamental questions”. 
It is much more than that – it is a place where we create and protect freedom. 
I am certain that she will instead challenge and provoke us, maybe even confront us with harsh realities; she will definitely encourage us to explore our freedom in this space and to discover the treasure enshrined in Article 5 of our constitution. 
Once again – my sincere thanks to all who have been involved in the creation of this work. 
Restoration of a synagogue in São Paulo 
© Fernando Siqueira 
The biggest city in the southern hemisphere with the longest traffic jams, the greatest number of helicopters, the best restaurants, the biggest German centre of industry in the world – São Paulo is a megalopolis, a city of superlatives. 
Restoration work on the synagogue 
Revival of the centre of São Paulo 
Amongst other things, the original plaque of architect Samuel Roder has been uncovered, along with a stone model of the building and above all, the original materials and colours, all so that the Synagogue can shine not only with a renewed freshness, but also in its original glory. 
A German-Brazilian symbiosis 
Along with the façade, the magnificent dome in Byzantine style and the stained glass windows, the wooden altar with its Torah shrine and the original benches dating back to 1932 were restored. 
Economic relations with Latin America 
The Chamber of Commerce Abroad in Paraguay was established 50 years ago. 
Today, Brazil and Mexico are important overseas locations for German industry. In many other Latin American countries, German companies are playing an increasingly important role. 
Latin America can look back on a golden decade, so to speak, because high demand, particularly from Asia, along with high prices for raw materials on the global market, generated strong growth in many Latin American countries. 
Population growth, increasing urbanisation and efforts to diversify economic structures offer opportunities for German businesses. 
Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin this evening (15 May) on the start of a new round of the Syria peace talks in Geneva: 
It is good that Staffan de Mistura has managed to get the parties to go to Geneva. 
The new round of intra-Syrian negotiations is a key milestone. 
For that it is crucial that the sides come together again before Ramadan. 
How can we meet the security needs of Jewish communities, and what is the best way to tackle anti-Semitic hate crime? 
The guide was developed as part of the “Turning Words into Action” project, which promotes prevention and the fight against anti-Semitism. 
Find out more about the presentation of the guide here. 
Following a break which has been far too long, progress in the talks between the Syrian regime and the opposition is urgently needed in Geneva. 
Background information: All OSCE participating States have pledged to resolutely combat anti-Semitism and all forms of hate crime against individuals or communities. 
The opportunities available to break out of the spiral of violence must not be wilfully squandered. 
Promoting human rights in Latin America 
Relations with Latin America are based on shared values, common interests and cultural ties. 
Latin America as a strategically important region 
The German Government’s Strategy on Latin America and the Caribbean 
Strategic Partnership between the EU and Latin America 
In the realm of international relations, Germany’s relations with Latin America and the Caribbean stand out as something special. 
Its priorities are as follows: 
The Strategic Partnership between the EU and Latin America covers all countries in the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean and thus around one billion people. 
It was founded in June 1999 at the first EU-LAC Summit in Rio de Janeiro. 
There is a tightly-woven network of diverse relationships, activities and cooperation mechanisms. 
Supporting the efforts of German companies 
The German Government is helping German businesses exploit the wealth of opportunities Latin America offers. 
First official visit to Poland 
Spotlight on Africa: 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Elke Büdenbender will be paying their first official visit to the Republic of Poland on 19 May 2017. 
Association agreements with particular regional groups or countries are an essential component of relations between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean region. 
They are based on the three pillars of political dialogue, trade and cooperation. 
The principal target group here are small and medium-sized enterprises. 
The negotiations on a comprehensive association agreement between the EU and Mercosur gained considerable momentum in 2016. 
A summit attended by the Heads of State and Government takes place every two years, while there are regular meetings of senior officials and, on occasion, ministerial meetings. 
The partnership also extends to civil society, parliaments and companies. 
Due to the many summits, it has been possible over the last few years to develop and refine the cooperation between the EU and Latin America. 
The agreements were approved by the European Parliament in 2012 and have been in force since 2013. 
They have increased both their economic and political clout, a fact reflected in the new assurance they demonstrate in the international arena. 
A common commitment to universal and indivisible human rights links Germany with its partners in Latin America. 
In addition, the Federal President and Elke Büdenbender will meet students for an informal discussion. 
Police officers outside synagogues, schools and cafés are part of everyday Jewish life in many countries. 
A practical guide that is being presented in the German Parliamentary Council at the Bundestag on 15 May seeks to provide answers to these questions. The publication is entitled “Understanding Anti-Semitic Hate Crimes and Addressing the Security Needs of Jewish Communities”. It explains the main characteristics of hate crime and offers guidance for governments and civil society on how they can best respond to hate crime and meet the security needs of Jewish communities, such as by closing gaps in the recording of anti-Semitic hate crime. 
OSCE Special Representative Gernot Erler, ODIHR Director Michael Georg Link, Member of the German Bundestag Doris Barnett and others will give opening speeches at the presentation of the guidelines in Berlin. 
On Monday (15 May), Minister of State Michael Roth attended the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. 
Only if a viable political solution is found regarding a transitional government and Syria’s future constitutional structures can the terrible conflict be ended. 
On Monday (15 May), Minister of State Michael Roth attended the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels. 
However, a number of challenges in this sphere remain in some Latin American countries. The German Government is therefore working to improve the human rights situation in this region, both through its bilateral relations and in the multilateral framework. 
The Foreign Ministers also discussed ways to strengthen the Common Security and Defence Policy. 
creating prospects for the young generation 
Minister of State Roth meets Slovenian Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec 
Roth stressed how important it was that Germany was making available 140 million euros to help fight starvation in the Horn of Africa. 
Everyone involved must work towards a viable and effective ceasefire for the whole of Syria and, at the same time, seek to ensure that a genuine and earnest political process under the auspices of the United Nations gets underway. 
“Words into Action” – tackling anti‑Semitism 
This initiative is overseen by the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and, with a budget of five million euros, is the largest project ever implemented by ODIHR.

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the resumption of the Syria negotiations in Geneva 
In Peru, for example, a so-called German Desk has been set up which provides small and medium-sized enterprises with specialised financial advice from the Chamber of Commerce Abroad, the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, the German Investment and Development Company and the local partner bank Banco Financiero. 
In 2016, Lateinamerika Verein e. V. – Business Association for Latin America – celebrated its 100th anniversary, as did the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. 
As a corporate network and information platform for German companies, Lateinamerika Verein e.V. – Business Association for Latin America – also makes a major contribution to launching and expanding business activities in the region. 
He added that to achieve this it was crucial to create prospects for young people in their homelands, 
and that transit countries also needed more support in dealing with migration flows. 
The Latin America Initiative of German Business brings together Germany’s business associations. 
Promoting sustainable production and use of energy and raw materials 
Promoting human rights projects 
For this reason, Moussa Faki Mahamat, the new Chair of the African Union Commission, was a guest at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting. 
These include projects dealing with issues such as: 
promoting women’s rights 
promoting democratic institutions 
strengthening the human rights dialogue and human rights training courses for state security forces; protecting human rights defenders 
protecting migrants in border areas 
investigating human rights violations 
In the sphere of energy, Germany is one of the region’s main partners for bilateral cooperation. 
There is significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency in Latin America – and it has by far not been fully tapped. 
The same applies to efficiency in energy generation and transportation. 
Ensuring that Germany has a sustainable, secure and cost-effective supply of energy and raw materials is another important aim of our cooperation with the region. 
The Council also discussed how the EU can respond more effectively to crisis situations. 
Roth said that rapid implementation of the joint decision to establish an EU command centre for military training missions was a priority, 
but added that this also needed to go hand in hand with bolstering civilian crisis mechanisms. 
the EU stands by its commitments 
As well as support for Africa, the Eastern Partnership was on the agenda. 
Foreign trade and investment promotion 
In this context, Minister of State Roth reminded participants of the recent decision to ease visa requirements for citizens of Ukraine. 
He underlined the fact that this step showed that the EU stood by its commitments when the Eastern European countries worked to promote democracy and the rule of law. 
Roth said that in the case of Ukraine, reforms had been shown to have brought “tangible benefits” for the population. 
Deliberations focused on the humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa and EU relations with Africa. 
However, he emphasised that this amount was not enough and that support from the EU needed to be increased. 
He said that as well as tackling the food crisis, the aim was to improve security and stability in many African countries in the long term. 
Strengthening the EU’s Global Strategy for security and defence 
Easing of visa requirements: 
The easing of visa requirements was preceded by progress in fighting corruption and promoting the rule of law, in the education system and in administration. 
The European Union has signed trade agreements with 26 of the region’s 33 countries. These include the CARIFORUM countries, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. 
Negotiations are underway on an agreement with the MERCOSUR countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). 
Latin America has rich deposits of minerals, such as iron, copper, tin and lithium. 
Just under 60% of the global production of lithium – needed, for instance, for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries for electric cars – comes from Latin America. 
There is still a considerable need to modernise and expand Latin America’s infrastructure, and this bears potential for transport and logistics companies. 
There is also a demand for cutting-edge German technology in other areas – for instance, in mining, renewable energies, environmental technology and the health sector. 
The German Chambers of Commerce Abroad, together with Germany’s missions abroad and Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI), a German Government agency, are the three main players in our external economic promotion activities. 
Besides security of supply, economic efficiency of production and environmental compatibility are the key factors that shape the German Government’s natural resources policy. 
The German Government is therefore supporting efforts by countries in the region to develop sustainable energy systems by providing advice, funding projects and concluding energy and climate protection agreements. 
Funding from the Cultural Preservation Programme made it possible to restore the Beth‑El synagogue built in 1929 in the centre of São Paulo to its former glory. 
The Beth‑El synagogue in São Paulo 
Funding from the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office, made it possible to restore the Beth‑El synagogue, built in 1929 and inaugurated in 1932 in the centre of São Paulo, to its former glory. 
And right at the heart of its once run‑down centre there is yet another superlative, namely the most important Jewish sacred building in Brazil, the former Beth‑El synagogue. 
Beth‑El was restored with funds from the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office and is now an integral part of the first Jewish museum in Brazil currently under construction. 
The museum complex will, moreover, be part of the work already begun to restore and revive the city centre. 
“The German restoration of the synagogue is a quantum leap,” commented the museum’s Director, Roberta Sundfeld, and “it has already attracted sponsors to the museum.” 
In this case, the Cultural Preservation Programme is not just living up to its name, it has provided the impetus for new projects and is thus a beautiful German-Brazilian symbiosis, symbolising the vibrant history of the centre of São Paulo. 
Minister of State Roth attends EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels 
In view of the threat of famine in the Horn of Africa, Roth went on to say that the EU had reiterated its awareness of the responsibility it shared for peace and stability on the African continent. 
This will allow Ukrainian citizens to travel to the Schengen area for up to 90 days without a visa. 
Education and research 
There are a large number of collaborations between German and Latin American universities and research institutes. 
Vocational training – dual training system 
An apprentice at a German company in Irapuato (Mexico) takes measurements. 
The apprentices are trained using the German dual training system. 
In many Latin America countries, there is keen interest in the German dual system of vocational training. 
This kind of training is thus an important focus of bilateral relations with many partners in the region. 
Research cooperation 
The growing internationalisation of academic cooperation is reflected in the large number of collaborations between German and Latin American universities and research institutes. 
Cooperation at universities 
Relatively few German students and academics opt to study or engage in research in the region. 
The number of German Academic Exchange Service fellows from Latin America has however risen significantly over the past years. 
The great interest is also reflected in the large number of grant programmes that are co-financed and co-run with partner countries. 
For example, in the period from 2012 to July 2016, the Brazilian Government’s academic travel programme, Ciência sem Fronteiras (Science without Borders) helped around 6500 students, PhD candidates and post-doctoral candidates to study at a German university. 
While English is definitely the foreign language of first choice in Latin America, there is great interest in what Europe has to offer in the cultural sphere. One reason for this is that many Latin Americans have German roots. 
This also explains why the German language is comparatively strong in the region. 
There are 760 schools in Latin America where German is taught. 
Around 350,000 pupils in the region are now learning German. 
The PASCH initiative 
The initiative Schools: Partners for the Future (PASCH) was launched by the Federal Foreign Office in February 2008. 
The goal is to create a worldwide network of German-language partner schools. 
The aim of this initiative is to encourage young people’s interest in contemporary Germany and the German language. 
The initiative’s network in Latin America now numbers 192 partner schools. 
Most of the German schools in Latin America were founded by German immigrants for their children and their neighbours’ children, some of them 150 years ago. 
Seven of these schools have vocational training centres, which primarily offer business training courses based on German models. 
The main vehicles for promoting interest in the German language in Latin America also include the 15 Goethe-Institut branches, which offer German classes as well as training courses for teachers of German. 
Latin America also has ten Goethe-Zentren, 33 German Academic Exchange Service lectorships and 31 funded German-partner country cultural associations. 
German in higher education 
In total, they have some 2500 students enrolled in German studies programmes and some 41,000 students learning German as a foreign language alongside their main subject. 
The growing demand for German classes at universities reflects a global trend towards more practical language learning. 
The German Academic Exchange Service also promotes partnerships between German studies departments at German and Latin American universities. 
It is currently supporting the following partnerships in Latin America: 
In Brazil: 
In Colombia: 
In Chile: 
In Cuba: 
A considerable number of universities in these countries have German studies departments, but some of their students have only very limited German language skills. 
When preparing for this event, my mind was drawn to two questions in particular: 
Are art exhibitions like this one here in Gotha really a continuation of politics by other means? 
We need each other. 
The world yearns for greater peace, stability and security. 
Many German companies have had subsidiaries in Latin America for over a century and have an excellent reputation there. 
The drop in prices of, and global demand for, raw materials, along with slower economic growth around the world, are posing great challenges to the region. 
But that we can only deliver if we work together. 
As a country with few raw materials, Germany is highly dependent on imports to supply its needs. 
Shared values and similar interests, as well as the close cultural ties that have developed over the years, form a unique basis for shaping cooperation that is both mutually beneficial at the bilateral level and reflects our shared responsibility at the multilateral level. 
In recent years and decades, Latin America and the Caribbean have undergone transformation in various ways. 
In some Latin American countries, new political movements and balances of power are leading political action in a new direction. 
Many countries in Latin America are seeking and finding a range of new partners in other parts of the world, particularly in Asia, but also in Africa. 
Since Germany is keen to put the traditionally close ties and shared interests we have with Latin America onto a secure footing for the future, we plan to step up our engagement with the region and present our country as a reliable long‑term partner. 
On 4 August 2010, the German Government presented an interministerial strategy to shape Germany’s long‑term Latin America policy. 
Cooperation on global challenges such as environmental protection and climate change, the fight against organised crime and drugs, and shaping the architecture of the global financial market 
Expansion of economic ties and promotion of mutually beneficial trade and investment in both directions 
Cross-border networking in the fields of science, research, education and culture 
The two regions cooperate closely in the spheres of politics, business, culture, and science and technology. 
The summits serve as a forum for political dialogue on important global issues and as a catalyst for shaping concrete bilateral relations (through association or partnership agreements, direction of development assistance, etc.). Since the establishment of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in 2010, these meetings have been known as EU‑CELAC Summits. 
Following far‑reaching global or association agreements with Mexico and Chile (in force since 2000 and 2005 respectively), in 2008 the EU concluded a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the Caribbean Forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (CARIFORUM), the Caribbean states within the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP). 
Negotiations on an association agreement with Central America and a multi‑party trade agreement with Peru and Colombia were concluded during the 2010 EU‑LAC Summit. 
This is one reason why cooperation with Latin America is of great importance, since Germany develops and brings to market a great deal of cutting-edge technology. 
Energy and raw materials policy plays a key role in Germany’s cooperation with Latin America. 
German companies are in an ideal position to participate in the modernisation of energy generation in Latin America. 
The challenge is to access new markets, particularly in the field of renewable energies, energy efficiency and environmental technology, as well as in the production of raw materials. 
This collaboration has not only made it possible for some of the French masterpieces on display here to be shown for the first time outside of Russia, 
On the contrary – we must continue to actively seek both political solutions and possibilities for compromise. 
They aren’t the cherry on the cake but the yeast in the dough. 
This is the only way to enable a return to the negotiation process. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel prior to his meeting with Prime Minister of Yemen Ahmed bin Dagher 
Therefore, it is right for us to help wherever we can, including by increasing Germany’s humanitarian aid for Yemen in 2017 to 125 million euros. 
Prior to his meeting today (16 May) with the Prime Minister of Yemen, Ahmed bin Dagher, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement: 
All parties to the conflict have a responsibility, in the interest of those who are suffering in Yemen, to stop playing for time and immediately cease all hostilities. The parties must make a serious effort to finally achieve progress towards resolving the deep intra‑Yemeni conflict. 
This week, high‑level representatives of Yemeni parties will again be coming to Berlin for an informal dialogue. This meeting will for the first time include representatives from the region. 
We strongly support the mediation efforts of UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. 
I have made an offer to UN Secretary‑General António Guterres, saying that Germany, as part of the effort to initiate a political process at the negotiation table, is prepared to assume an active role. We are willing to do so also because we are in contact with, and held in high regard by, neighbouring countries. 
This makes us the third-largest donor. 
Speech by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth at the opening of the Gotha exhibition of French masterpieces from Russia 
For Germany and Russia alike, the loss of cultural property has been a painful wound in our cultural identity. 
Our cultural relations and education policy does not avert its eyes from critical social issues. 
Everywhere. 
In Argentina, increased cooperation on research led to the establishment of the CONICET - Partner Institute of the Max Planck Society (2011) and of a branch of the Max Planck Society in Buenos Aires (2014) and of the Max Planck Laboratory in Rosario (2014). 
As a result of the economic crisis in Brazil, the programme has now been suspended. 
Despite these shared values, there are still major tasks to be tackled in some Latin American states. 
Upholding and protecting human rights are key principles guiding the German Government’s foreign policy action. 
The countries of Latin America are faced with tasks of varying magnitude for which the German Government can lend its support. 
Championing human rights also featured prominently in the German Government’s Strategy on Latin America and the Caribbean. 
The German Government is supporting Latin American countries in their efforts to combat impunity, advance judicial reform, guarantee freedom of the press and of expression, combat child labour and child prostitution, foster the non-discrimination of minorities and strengthen the economic and social rights of disadvantaged population groups. 
The German Government is conducting an active dialogue with civil society in Latin American countries – in particular with NGOs, which have assumed a key role as partners in German-funded projects. 
Hundreds of thousands of euros are made available every year to finance human rights projects in Latin America. 
implementing penal reforms. 
By voting in favour of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the German Government demonstrated its determination to support the implementation of this Declaration. 
On Tuesday (16 May), Foreign Minister Gabriel met with the Yemeni Prime Minister to discuss ways of finding a political solution to the conflict. 
However, the only way to permanently end the suffering of the civilian population is through a political agreement.

The Foreign Minister expressed his concern about the situation prior to his meeting with bin Dagher: 
This makes Germany the country’s third-largest donor. 
“The people of Yemen are in a desperate situation. They face the threats of hunger, disease – for example, the current cholera outbreak – and, all too often, ongoing fighting.” 
Willing to mediate 
“We must continue to actively seek political solutions.” 
This is the only way to enable a return to the negotiation process,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said before the meeting. 
He went on to say that Germany is prepared to assume an active role as part of the effort to initiate a political process at the negotiation table. 
The Foreign Minister called on all parties to the conflict to do their part towards solving the deep intra‑Yemeni conflict. 
They have a responsibility, he said, in the interest of those who are suffering in Yemen, to stop playing for time and “immediately cease all hostilities. 
“We strongly support the mediation efforts of the UN Special Envoy.” 
On Tuesday (16 May), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met with Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher in Berlin to discuss ways of finding a political solution to the conflict. 
A desperate situation 
The rapid spread of cholera in Yemen has already claimed far more than 100 lives. 
“As essential as our aid is for the survival of the people in Yemen, it is also clear that the solution cannot be to accept the armed conflict and thereby limit our efforts to humanitarian aid.” 
“We must continue to actively seek both political solutions and possibilities for compromise.

Gabriel back in Washington: Transatlantic partnership benefits both sides 
Offering joint security in a crisis-stricken world. 
Safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs through close economic cooperation. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is visiting the United States for the second time since taking up office. 
Portraits have assumed a central place both in the Cranach exhibition in Moscow and in this show of French masterpieces in Gotha. 
Rather, both sides of the Atlantic are winners in the open and rules-based trade system. 
It put the individual in the focus of art and politics. 
That is why Foreign Minister Gabriel will argue in favour of maintaining open markets during his talks with representatives of the US Administration. 
Shouldering joint responsibility 
But portraits also remained a depiction of power, dominion, and political or economic importance, as was brought home to us by Cranach in particular with his many portraits of Luther. 
Interest was huge. 
Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the presentation of the German Football Ambassador award to Miroslav Klose 
The fifth award ceremony for German Football Ambassador took place yesterday (16.05) at the Federal Foreign Office. 
“Doing what we can to help” – solutions urgently needed for Yemen 
Humanitarian aid is important for alleviating the immediate hardship of the people in Yemen. 
It was therefore right to increase Germany’s humanitarian aid for Yemen in 2017 to 125 million euros. 
However, there is barely any sign of progress in the political process. 
Considering the dreadful situation and that the international humanitarian community has shown solidarity for, and willingness to help, Yemen, we have very clear expectations in this regard.” 
Since Sunday, around a dozen high-level representatives of Yemeni parties and groups, as well as, for the first time, representatives from the region, have been participating in a dialogue in Berlin. 
These talks are meant to underpin the efforts of UN Special Envoy for Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, who met with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on 16 March. 
Well, with all due respect, Miroslav Klose: 
German football gives us a good image. 
North Germans get together: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Miroslav Klose has broken every goal record that a striker can break:

Through this initiative, 19 projects have already been funded throughout the world, from Nepal to Namibia, over the last few years. 
Whether working as a national coach in Nigeria or a striker in Barcelona, German players and coaches are often the best-known German faces abroad. 
Whether it be climate change or terrorism: such challenges affect the international community as a whole. 
Europe and the United States have to assume responsibility together to find solutions to these problems. 
Strong Europe in the United States’ interest 
If this balance was maintained and the burden was fairly distributed then both sides of the Atlantic could be sure that

Before leaving on a trip to the United States and Mexico, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel gave the following statement today (17 May): 
and this included emancipating itself in the sphere of security policy. 
– top scorer in the Bundesliga! 
Since President Trump assumed office, many members of the new US administration have made clear – also after intensive discussions with us – that they have a great interest in a united and strong Europe, and that they fully support the transatlantic partnership we have in NATO. 
Everyone benefits from open markets and from a fair, multilateral trade system. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling to the United States today (17 May) for the second time since taking up office. 
There is no lack of good reasons to champion the European‑American partnership. 
That is why Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is travelling to the United States on Wednesday (17 May) for the second time since taking up office. 
trade between the two countries is anything but a zero‑sum game in which everything revolves around competition on the markets. 
The around 670,000 jobs created in the United States thanks to German investments make it quite clear that 
Maintaining a friendship which has grown over the decades. 
All of this is good, and must by no means be taken for granted. 
German corporations’ role in the United States is not only competitive. 
Afterwards, I will on Thursday evening be travelling to Mexico, an important partner in the G20 and the OECD, as well as one of the most important countries in the world for German foreign investment. 
Through investments and innovation, we create hundreds of thousands of jobs and apprenticeships there. 
Mexico is already home to some 2000 companies in which German corporations hold an interest. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel ready to depart for the United States and Mexico 
“I will today be making my second trip to Washington since the new administration took office. I want to reaffirm that we are interested in good and close transatlantic relations based on trust, and I want to deepen our conversation with our American partners. 
We are, however, concerned by the fact that Washington is not firmly committed to free trade, as became evident recently during the meeting of G7 finance ministers. 
I am also glad that, next year, Mexico will be the first Partner Country from Latin America at HANNOVER MESSE, where it can showcase itself as a prime location for business and investment.” 
That’s why I’m pleased we will have the opportunity to visit Pittsburgh, where we will see first hand how structural change can succeed, also with the participation of German firms. 
For more than fifty years, the Federal Foreign Office has been supporting the posting of football coaches to developing countries to harness the positive social effects of sport. 
Award winner Horst Kriete 
Football and development have been part of Horst Kriete's life for more than 35 years. 
In 1979, Kriete began his international career in Nigeria, where for three years he was in charge of coaching in the Nigerian football association. 
The most important thing for Kriete was always the sport itself and the lasting social changes that football can bring with it. 
On behalf of FIFA and the DFB, he ran training courses for coaches and took on various advisory jobs. 
Football ambassadors shape Germany’s image all over the world. 
German footballers and trainers actively bridge borders. 
Yesterday, there was an award ceremony for the winners of the "German Football Ambassador." 
The main award in the “coach” category went to Horst Kriete and the audience award in the “player” category went to Bastian Schweinsteiger. 
World champion Miroslav Klose won the honorary award. 
The honorary award went to Miroslav Klose. 
These awards are given to football coaches and players whose work in sports and society helps give Germany a good image. 
The awards come with prize money that must be used to fund social projects abroad. 
Since then, this native of Lower Saxony has had a very eventful life and helped shape the face of football all over the world. 
He has been posted to more than 50 countries. 
They worked together to humanise Russia’s penal system. 
From 2004 to 2009, Kriete worked for the Chinese football association, where he restructured the youth and coach training programmes and made a huge contribution to the sport and cultural exchanges between Germany and China. 
And what a contrast to Golitsyn’s role in the partition of Poland. 
For example, in recent years, the countries of the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru) have shown increased interest and, as an observer country, Germany is playing an active role when it comes to vocational training. 
Latin America's role in the sphere of science, research and innovation is growing constantly. 
National investment in education and research is generating progress, and the region is becoming an increasingly important partner for Germany as a result. 
A forum for events and services by German scientific organisations was created in São Paulo in Brazil with the inauguration of the German House of Science and Innovation. 
As part of the Research and Academic Relations Initiative, three of a total of four centres of excellence worldwide were set up in Latin America – The Corporation Center of Excellency in Marine Sciences (CEMarin) in Colombia, the German-Colombian Peace Institute and the Heidelberg Center in Santiago. 
The German-Argentine University Centre promotes academic cooperation and the development of binational degree courses at German and Argentine universities. 
The same holds true for the cooperation programmes UNIBRAL and UNIBRAL II concluded between the Brazilian and German Education Ministries in 2000 and 2008 to promote cooperation between universities in the two countries. The programmes were implemented by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and its Brazilian partner organisation CAPES and facilitated exchanges for German and Brazilian students, post-doctoral candidates and professors as well as cooperation between faculties of the two countries. 
In 2017, the two programmes were integrated into the regular DAAD programmes International Study and Training Partnerships (ISAP) and International Degree Programmes with a Double Degree. 
These include 37 German schools abroad, 85 schools offering the German Language Certificate (DSD) and 70 schools starting up or expanding German teaching programmes (FIT schools). 
“Love the art in yourself, not yourself in the art!” 
They have now developed into major international schools and include the largest such school worldwide: 
Porto Seguro in São Paulo with a total of some 10,000 pupils, most of whom are Brazilian. 
Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín – Freiburg University of Education 
Today, as it was in Cranach’s time. 
Universidad de la Habana, Havana - Gießen University 
German as a foreign language in school tends to be offered mainly in southern Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and southern Brazil), where a significant proportion of the population is of German descent. 
A big thank you to the organisers of today’s exhibition! 
And we can indeed learn something from it if we open our minds to it. 
And so – to get back to my two initial questions – this art exhibition is political in nature. 
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre – Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg 
Mr Mayor, Ms Taubert, Mr Shvydkoy, Ms Loshak, Professor Eberle, Excellencies, Ambassador Grinin, Ambassador Etienne, honoured guests, 
can we learn anything for today from the art of bygone times? 
Trust in Russia has been eroded by the illegal annexation of Crimea, the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the measures taken to suppress criticism and the barbaric attacks on homosexuals in Chechnya. 
At the opening of the Moscow exhibition you, Professor Shvydkoy, expressed your hope that such joint projects would prepare the ground for talking about more difficult issues. 
More and more German researchers are finding interesting research partners in Latin America. 
In 2010, for example, the first Fraunhofer Institute in Latin America was set up in the Chilean capital Santiago. 
Academic cooperation has also become more important in the university sector, resulting in a large number of successful collaborations. 
Academic exchange is developing just as dynamically. 
Some 345 universities in Latin America offer German studies or German language programmes. 
The aim of inter-faculty German language classes, which are mainly given by DAAD lectors, is to remedy this situation. 
Out-of-school German language programmes 
In some countries, German language courses for adults are only provided by the Goethe-Institut, Goethe Centres and German-partner country cultural societies. 
In a few metropolitan areas (such as São Paulo, Mexico City and Buenos Aires) there are also a limited number of commercial providers of German courses. 
Let us counteract this growing alienation first and foremost by strengthening and revitalising civil society exchange. 
For this reason, too, “inspiring people” is the slogan of our cultural relations and education policy. 
Art and culture create human relationships. They help us understand each other better. 
We want to inspire people across borders – for example through our numerous fellowship and residency programmes and our youth exchange programmes. 
It takes sides. It takes the side of humanity, respect, diversity and artistic freedom. 
It is the job of cultural relations to create space for intellectual exchange and for the forming of emotional bonds. 
It is the lifeblood of our societies. 
It is with this in mind that we also support projects to expand civil society exchange with Russia and eastern European countries. 
That can certainly be of particular advantage in politics. 
As Paul Klee said in 1920, art does not reproduce what we see; rather it makes us see. 
Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora were the first commoners in Germany to be painted in this style. 
This development has been shown to great effect in the two major exhibitions in the United States which the Federal Foreign Office has helped fund. 
Their close relative, Princess Natalya Golitsyna, had a great fondness for card games and was the inspiration for Pushkin’s eponymous figure “The Queen of Spades” in the short story published in 1834, when she was still alive. 
In the story, Hermann’s avarice leads to his betrayal of his beloved and the death of the Queen of Spades, but he is intoxicated by his belief in the magic power he has thereby gained which will guarantee that he triumphs in any card game. 
He embodies the aristocratic imperial ambitions of his time. 
The aforementioned Prince Golitsyn is also remembered for founding Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow with his own money, and for leaving a large part of his inheritance to the institution. 
It is thus of unexpected relevance to us today! What a role model! 
Portraiture remains a mirror of its time. 
What a warning this is to the rulers and chancers of the modern world with their inflated egos! 
The artworks however also presage the fundamental shift which saw the decline of the noble houses of Europe in the second half of the 19th century and ushered in the age of nation states based on liberal or conservative values. 
Especially since the Prince Golitsyn pictured in the portrait played a key role in the negotiations on the first partition of Poland. 
The Golitsyn portrait thus also depicts one of the first protagonists of fledgling civil society engagement and an enabler of German-Russian cooperation. 
In the early 20th century, irresponsible aristocratic elites and aggressive nationalism drew Europe into the cataclysm of the First World War. 
In an era when digitally filtered selfies are “advancing” portrait art in a highly ambivalent manner, questions about the place humans assume in society, in a world shaped by advancing globalisation and digitalisation, are still very topical. 
President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe today presented the team with which they want to start governing the country. 
We want now to develop concrete projects and proposals very quickly so that we can chalk up the first successes at the Franco-German Council of Ministers in July. 
Germany and France: bilateral relations 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (17 May) during his flight to Washington: 
In him, we have a partner with vast political experience who has earned great acclaim, most recently as Defence Minister. 
What we need to do now is keep moving Europe forward together, take the initiative and get the Franco-German engine revving at top speed. 
– record scorer for the national team! 
– top scorer in the 2006 World Cup! 
– World Cup goal record with 16 goals! 
and of course – World Champion! 
Just take a moment to think about it: 
Or the crucial equaliser against Argentina in the World Cup quarter final here in Germany. 
What central message do you as Foreign Minister have for the three-day Congress? 
You have no idea how much work you made for us here at the Federal Foreign Office! 
But the special thing about you, Miroslav Klose, is this: 
Yet you manage to ensure that your football opponents don't have to feel like losers. 
That's why Football Ambassador, diplomat, is, after all, an appropriate term. 
For even though he has scored so many goals against other teams, Miroslav Klose is characterised by his respect for his opponents, his team spirit, his fairness, his decency – and this he undoubtedly also shares with Uwe Seeler. 
But back to your question. 
And that is exactly why we can't think of anyone who deserves this award more! 
Miroslav Klose once said: 
“Anyone who knows me, knows that 
the team always comes first, then nothing, and after that, at some point, it's my turn.” 
And that's true: 
Both on and off the field! 
Miroslav Klose is such a player. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the appointment of Jean‑Yves Le Drian as new French Foreign Minister 
I am especially looking forward to working with Jean‑Yves Le Drian. 
That is the goal we share and I am sure that we can continue seamlessly with the wonderful cooperation with him. 
I extend a warm invitation to him that we meet for talks very soon. 
That is what so many fans like about him. 
Congratulations and thank you very much! 
Many successful projects that have been conducted through public private partnerships demonstrate to me how important and valuable these partnerships are. 
I want to build on this. 
In eastern Africa, millions of people are starving. 
At the Somalia Conference in London, you pledged assistance. 
His team went on to lose the game. 
Maybe he would have saved the game for his team if he had kept quiet. 
However, Klose's gesture earned him the respect of team colleagues and opponents throughout the football world. 
Ladies and gentlemen, that is why Miroslav Klose is a great Football Ambassador. 
He stands for fairness, team spirit, commitment and, of course, for exceptional performance! 
Miroslav Klose, we are all delighted that you will remain involved with German football as a trainer after the end of your football career. 
You have made an outstanding contribution to football. 
You have shaped the image of Germany abroad in the most positive way. 
I was in Somalia two weeks ago to see the situation for myself. 
You are right, 
Fields are parched, livestock dead, people starving. 
We cannot stand by and do nothing. 
That is why Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to the United States on Wednesday (17 May) for the second time since taking up office. 
German Football Ambassador awards presented at the Federal Federal Foreign Office 
On Tuesday, there was an award ceremony for the winners of the "German Football Ambassador“ at the Federal Foreign Office. 
This former DFB chief trainer also worked for more than six years in total in South Africa, running international coach training programmes. 
That is why Germany recently made more funding available. 
We are now the second-largest bilateral donor in the sphere of humanitarian assistance worldwide and we will continue along this path. 
Together with other international donors, we have now covered some 55% of what is needed according to United Nations figures. 
We must mobilise more funding. 
And how? 
“That was a really good conversation!” 
Neues Bild: 
hope for a better life, development prospects and an end to poverty. 
He has never tried to draw attention to himself with loud statements or poses. 
Following his meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson, Sigmar Gabriel said: 
because he had touched the ball with his hand! 
We are talking to other donors, also with those who could do more. 
For us, these countries include China, Russia and also Saudi Arabia. 
And we will not wane in our efforts. 
Not just here in Germany, but also in Italy, where, in Rome, he rapidly won the hearts of the tifosi through his playing, and that is no mean feat. 
For in the interconnected world, the impact of supposedly local crises is felt around the globe. 
What do you think about moving the troops to Jordan? 
Gabriel’s talks with Tillerson on these issues lasted twice as long as originally planned. 
We revisited all the topics from our previous talks. 
An ambassador in a building full of diplomats – people who work to forge good relations with their counterparts, as it says in the dictionary, 
people who try to engage with people without annoying them. 
After all, your performance will have made an impression on several of your opponents all over the world! 
was it possible to achieve all this by diplomatic means, 
with regard to our good relations in this world? 
Gabriel reported that on topics such as Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Russia they agreed on many points regarding the challenges and how to address them. 
Insofar he considered the meeting to have been very helpful. 
spectacular goals, like the 8:0 win against Saudi Arabia, a country with which we are constantly working to forge better relations – and three of those goals were headers from you! 
Foreign Minister Gabriel ready to depart for the United States and Mexico (press release of 17 May 2017) 
Using this deployment as a political pawn, as Turkey is obviously planning, can only backfire. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Gabriel at the opening of the German-American Conference: The Marshall Plan and its legacies - Towards a strong transatlantic partnership (16 May 2017) 
Transatlantic relations 
What does that mean exactly? 
We have been insulted and have tried time and again to reach out to the Turkish Government. 
You can be pleased about good popularity ratings and praise for doing your job courageously. 
Have you found the best job of your life? 
My three wonderful daughters are the best job of my life. 
But what you say is right, 
[Video BM Statement zu AM USA Untertitel] 
We had truly excellent talks. 
Naturally, we’ve discussed the situation in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, our relations with Russia and the various conflicts we will be tackling together. 
I think that these talks were extremely helpful and that they will continue in the same vein. 
We agree on many of the challenges ahead and on how best to tackle them. 
Federal Foreign Office on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson commented today (17 May) on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 
This decision was long overdue and finally reflects the outcome of the elections held in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in December 2016. 
The leader of the SDSM, Zaev, now has the mandate to form a government. 
We call upon all players in Skopje now to work together constructively - also in the upcoming coalition negotiations. 
Gabriel noted positively after his talks with his counterpart Rex Tillerson: 
Win‑win rather than zero‑sum game 
That is why Foreign Minister Gabriel argued in favour of maintaining open markets during his talks with US Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. 
The numerous crises in the world – from Syria to Ukraine and North Korea – are another reason for Europe and the United States to cooperate more closely. 
However, the initiative had to come from Europe 
Although Europe had some catching up to do in terms of hard power, Gabriel said, the American side should not lose sight of the importance of its soft power. 
Germany will continue to support the country along this route. 
Given the upheaval in our world and the large number of conflicts, we are trying to involve the foundations, which have unbelievably good networks and expertise, more intensively in our foreign policy communication. 
Are others ruthlessly shirking their responsibility? 
After all, this is the breeding ground where the terrorist organisations of our world are finding recruits. 
Turkey has again denied Members of the German Bundestag access to German soldiers at the Incirlik air base. 
We did not give into this in the past and we are not going to do so in the future. 
In recent months, we really have done everything not to slam the door shut for Turkey. 
But now that German nationals keep being imprisoned with incomprehensible charges, that they are denied consular assistance, that Germans are not allowed to leave Turkey and now that attempts are also to be made to blackmail the German parliament, we have reached the limit of what is acceptable. 
I can only hope that the Turkish Government will change its mind in the coming days. 
Otherwise the German Bundestag will surely not leave the soldiers in Turkey. 
the job as Foreign Minister is not just very important, 
On the evening before his departure, Gabriel had stressed to the German-American Conference in Berlin that a strong and united Europe was also in the United States’ interest. 
Far-reaching reforms are needed in order for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to proceed further along the path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. 
The country's people do not deserve to have political games played out at their expense. 
I am delighted to be honouring you as Football Ambassador today. 
I suspect you may well have annoyed people during your encounters on the football pitch in the last few years, at least your football-playing opponents! 
And yet I ask myself: 
I imagine there are a few countries which were critical of Germany when Miroslav Klose went off the field. 
Or the 7:1 victory against Brazil in the World Cup semi‑final three years ago! 
of course, you are an ambitious sportsman. You want to win – otherwise you wouldn't have achieved nearly as much in your football career. 
At all stages of his career, whether in Kaiserslautern, Bremen, Munich or latterly with S.S. Lazio in Rome, Miro Klose has always made his team his first priority. 
I think football fans have a very fine sense for when a player has no aspirations to be a star, and doesn't pretend to be something he isn't amid all the hype surrounding professional football. 
Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that he once scored the deciding goal in the Rome Derby for S.S. Lazio in the third minute of extra time ... After that, an Italian sports newspaper christened him “the true king of Rome”. 
And for many he even became the “emperor of Rome”, when during a match he wouldn't allow a goal he had scored for S.S. Lazio, despite the fact that the referee had already approved it, 
at the same time you have set an example of how it is possible not to deny one's own culture and national origins and still be a role model for many other people in our country. 
I hope you are pleased to receive this special prize. 
Although I do understand if you don't express your delight in the same extraordinary way that we've seen when you've scored a goal ... with a somersault! 
“Espousing a transatlantic agenda”: 
Gabriel opens German-American conference 
It is a positive development that President Ivanov has changed course and is no longer blocking the formation of a new government. 
This can be an important initial step along the way to overcoming the political crisis which has enfolded the country for months. 
What the country needs, and what its citizens rightly expect, is the rapid formation of a new government which will actively work on the comprehensive implementation of the arrangements made in the Pržino Agreement and on the other urgent reform priorities. 
Federal Foreign Office on the comments made by President Ivanov of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
Foreign Minister Gabriel gave the opening address. 
We are pleased that, after a long period of consideration, President Ivanov has managed to reach the right decision and given up his obstructionist stance. 
Renewing transatlantic relations: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel at the opening of the conference 
Marshall argued that without economic stability, there could be no political stability and hence no guarantee of peace. 
Gabriel back in Washington: 
Transatlantic partnership benefits both sides 
At the beginning of the conference he stated: “We, both in Europe and in the United States, are standing at a crossroads. 
Should we just stand by and watch as our liberal and open world order, built on balance and compromise, is increasingly threatened with disintegration? 
Accusations directed at German diplomats and those of other friendly nations are inappropriate. 
Initiative should come from Europe 
With regard to the comments made by President Ivanov of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia concerning the German Ambassador in Skopje, Christine Althauser, a Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (18 May): 
The opening address was followed by a panel discussion Kjer/photothek.net 
Gabriel said that the initiative for this renewal had to come from Europe. 
“We need to do everything we can to renew our partnership and imbue it with new momentum.” 
In the Schengen area, it is particularly easy for citizens to live and work on both sides of a border. 
Exchange within society, he added, was also vital. 
Click here to find out more about the third conference on Franco-German cross-border cooperation in Hambach in April 2017: 
He believed that to counteract this development, societies needed to be brought into contact with one another and exchange in the areas of culture, business and academia intensified. 
Visit to the United States 
Gabriel concluded by saying that although European initiative was important, 
The Foreign Minister soon had an opportunity to continue the transatlantic dialogue: following the conference he travelled to the United States for the second time since assuming office. 
The rules-based international order - the safety net of our external freedom - is increasingly being called into question. 
We need to stand up for our values and principles at home and abroad, we need to jointly defend them. 
Europe and the United States are standing at a crossroads 
Foreign Minister Gabriel declared that today, this world order that had been built up since 1945 was no longer seen as a given by all countries. 
we are ready to reach out to each other again as soon as there is a basis on which to do so. 
In the midst of these political difficulties, this wonderful art exhibition gives us the chance to focus on a long‑standing trust‑based German-Russian partnership – the collaboration between the Friedenstein Castle Foundation in Gotha and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. 
It was the first such exhibition ever to be held in Moscow or elsewhere and 
it met with overwhelming interest. 
I can only endorse this hope! 
Yesterday, Cranach in Moscow – and today French masterpieces in Gotha. Both exhibitions are part of our endeavour to keep the dialogue between us alive in these politically strained times. 
Only by meeting and exchanging ideas with other people can we create an environment that provides the scope for intellectual flexibility and development, fosters understanding and empathy, and breaks down prejudices. 
That’s what this project in Gotha is about as well. 
Culture has always been and will remain a “motor” of social processes. 
We should also take the contemplation of art as an opportunity to see things from another perspective. 
Art is thus also a mirror of its time. 
In the 15th century, the genre of portraiture was becoming fashionable in the Italian city states, but it was still revolutionary. 
To hang pictures of them on your own four walls was a courageous sign of support for the Reformation. 
Portraits from the Cranach workshop thus played a similarly central role in the success of the Reformation as Gutenberg’s printing press had done 50 years earlier. 
The German Cultural Forum for Eastern Europe is currently responsible for a total of seven touring exhibitions which show just what far‑reaching political, religious and social effects the Reformation had in eastern Europe and even in Russia. 
The French masters on show here – like Cranach many years before them – produced works commissioned by aristocrats at their courts, and so continued the tradition of portrait painting. 
However, their paintings also reveal how, following the Reformation and the rise of Absolutism in European capitals from Paris to Moscow in the 16th to 18th centuries, even more emphasis was laid on symbols of power. 
What we see here today is thus in a sense the passion for art and collecting of a powerful pan‑European aristocratic elite. 
They defined themselves primarily through their noble lineage and their claims of dominion, and far less through their language or culture or that of their subjects. 
For example, the exhibition includes portraits by François‑Lois Drouais and Jean‑Marc Nattier of Princess Ekaterina Golitsyna and Prince Dimitri Golitsyn. 
But then he makes a mistake at the crucial moment – and loses everything. 
Later on, members of the Golitsyn family and, from 1828 to 1853, the German doctor Friedrich Haas, known as the “holy doctor of Moscow”, worked in this very hospital. 
The deaths and deprivations this entailed swept the German and Russian royal families from the political stage, 
paving the way for the Russian Revolution of February-March and October-November 1917, and the November Revolution of 1918 and the creation of the Weimar Republic. 
Konstantin Stanislavski, who co‑founded the Moscow Art Theatre company in 1898, once said: 
I wish all those active in the Russian-German dialogue on art and culture all the best – may you have lots of good ideas and pursue meaningful projects. 
Dialogue not speechlessness, exchange not isolation, inspiration not desolation, freedom not oppression, courage not resignation – that’s what I wish for us all. 
Our relationship with Russia is currently experiencing some turbulence. 
but last year it also resulted in a Cranach exhibition in Moscow, which brought together works from Gotha’s Cranach collection with pieces that had been removed at the end of the Second World War. 
“Extending cooperation with foundations” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel spoke to the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (17 May 2017) about the Foundation Congress to be held in Osnabrück. 
On 16 and 17 May a conference was held at the Federal Foreign Office in cooperation with Atlantik-Brücke e.V. and the American Council on Germany. 
What role do transatlantic relations play in today’s world, and how will the partnership develop? 
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16 and 17 May), a German-American conference was held at the Federal Foreign Office in cooperation with Atlantik-Brücke e.V. and the American Council on Germany. Its motto was “Finding Common Ground: Confronting Challenges and Setting Priorities for Europe and the United States”. 
70th anniversary of the Marshall Plan 
Seventy years ago, American General George Marshall gave a speech which led to what is now known as the Marshall Plan: the United States’ reconstruction assistance for Europe in the wake of the Second World War. 
He said that this stability could be ensured only through cooperation, not isolation. 
The idea was that with the help of the United States, the European countries should therefore be rebuilt as economic partners, and that Europe’s status as a partner of the United States should also be restored with regard to shared values. 
Gabriel went on to say that in today’s phase of transition, it was only wise to remember the political challenges that had resulted in closer transatlantic cooperation after the Second World War. 
He added that in the sphere of security policy, Europe needed to emancipate itself from the United States, and that burdens in the transatlantic partnership needed to be distributed fairly. 
He declared that while Europe had some catching up to do in terms of hard power, the American side should not lose sight of the significance of its soft power. 
At the Foundation Congress in Osnabrück at which Europe’s foundations enter into dialogue with politics and business, the focus is on education. 
He said that it was important above all to focus on the political values they shared: the democratic separation of powers, inalienable human rights, the rule of law and representative democracy. 
He explained that both in Europe and in the United States, societies were becoming increasingly polarised, which made relations between societies more complex. 
Gabriel emphasised that this process also had to include those unable to afford a trip across the Atlantic. 
“finally, we, too, as governments on both sides of the Atlantic, ... must declare that we espouse a new, common transatlantic agenda.” 
Five key points concerning the renewal of transatlantic relations (extract from Sigmar Gabriel’s address) 1. 
We constantly need to re‑anchor them in our societies and ensure that the burdens of these relations are fairly distributed. 
First of all, I would like to say that I would have loved to come to Osnabrück for the Foundation Congress but I unfortunately couldn’t manage as I am heading off on a trip to the United States and Mexico. 
Since 2015, the Federal Foreign Office, the first government institution in Germany to do so, has conducted strategic dialogue with private and charitable foundations which are working internationally. 
I’m also enjoying it very much. 
the drought on the Horn of Africa has robbed many of their livelihoods. 
But, that also means a further 45% is still required. 
Instead of constantly demanding more money for arms, we need to realise that for lasting stability and peace we need above all 
That is what is behind our Berlin Humanitarian Call, and also the Somalia Conference in London. 
The work of the Bundeswehr, the German parliamentary army, is an important factor in the fight against IS – this is not just in our interest but is shared by key NATO partners, for example by the United States. 
Those who try to blackmail us to force us to disregard the German fundamental right to asylum and only allow our parliamentarians to visit the Bundeswehr in their country if we expose political refugees to imprisonment and torture are not going to get anywhere with us. 
If it is no longer possible to work sensibly from Incirlik – and this does of course include that Members of the German Bundestag can visit their soldiers – then we need to consider alternatives.

EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region 
Germany and France shared the remaining costs for the construction of the bridge. 
The Strategy for the Alpine Region seeks to support sectors in the region such as agriculture and forestry, tourism, energy, healthcare and high technology. 
It is a well-known fact that the assessments conveyed to the guest country always emerge in close coordination between the Foreign Ministry and the Embassy itself. 
The development of closer links in Europe is particularly apparent in border regions – at political and economic, as well as at social and cultural level. 
The development of closer links in Europe is particularly apparent in border regions – at political and economic, as well as at social and cultural level. 
Moreover, the EU is promoting regional cooperation between a number of countries located in the same geographic area, such as the Baltic Sea, the Alpine region and along the Danube. 
When asked in a survey about the persistence of barriers that restrict cross-border cooperation, some 40 percent of the inhabitants of border regions considered socio-economic and legal and administrative differences to be a hurdle. 
Although their budgets are relatively small, the projects that are supported achieve numerous tangible results for citizens – be it the development of transport links, cooperative partnerships in the education sector, healthcare, environmental protection or the creation of jobs. 
Thanks to the new, faster connection, the regions on both sides of the Rhine are becoming increasingly economically and culturally interlinked. 
In addition, the two countries are cooperating closely in the environmental sphere. 
Pittsburgh – Story of an amazing comeback 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is visiting the Rust Belt to get an insight into Pittsburgh’s amazing comeback. 
You could actually call Pittsburgh another Phoenix: 
the city, which used to be the world’s steel capital but then virtually collapsed along with the industry, has risen from the ashes to new glory. 
During his visit on Thursday (18 May), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel got an insight into this fantastic story – and the part played in it by Germany.

Abandon it! 
BM Video McMaster White House 
From then on, Pittsburgh’s image was to be shaped not by wealth, but by rust. 
Soon, one in five was unemployed. 
Half of the city’s population moved away. 
What crisis? 
In 2017, there is absolutely no trace of the crisis: 
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) boasts 19 Nobel Prize laureates among its alumni. 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera are among the best in the country. 
When the Administration first took office, that was not so clear. 
And secondly, 
we also spoke of course about the situation in Syria. 
Secret of success 
The secret of this success is clever strategic planning focusing deliberately on key sectors for the future – IT, robotics and medicine. 
The city has been able to attract multinational companies such as Google or Alcoa. 
Major German companies including Bayer and Bosch have established important subsidiaries there. 
The Bosch Group is one of the sponsors of the Carnegie Bosch Institute at CMU – 
another indication that import and export figures are not the only way to measure the benefits of economic exchange between Germany and the United States. 
Who still burns coal? 
Researchers at CMU presented their state-of-the-art robotics projects.

Cross-border cooperation in many spheres 
We talked once more with the Americans about our options for relaunching efforts to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. 
Some 6.6 billion euros have been set aside from the EU budget for border regions for the 2014‑2020 period (in the context of Interreg projects). 
as part of the Initiative on electromobility and the digital age, a joint project that was launched in September 2016, a cross‑border testing ground is currently being set up in the Saarland/Metz region for self-driving and connected vehicles. 
In April 2017, the tramway line that connects the city of Strasbourg in Alsace and Kehl in Baden, Germany, was officially inaugurated. 
The Strasbourg tram now runs across the River Rhine, all the way to Kehl train station. Work to extend this line to Kehl town hall should be completed by 2018. 
The tramway is also reducing the amount of car traffic crossing the Rhine. 
Preliminary planning and construction of the bridge over the Rhine were co‑financed with EU funds from the Interreg programme. 
For example, the project GREATER GREEN, which was established in September 2016, bundles existing environmental technology clusters in the border region. 
One example is the trilateral academic alliance European Campus – EUCOR, founded in May 2016, which consists of the universities of Basel, Freiburg, Haute‑Alsace and Strasbourg, as well as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
The first Franco-German employment agency in Kehl, Land Baden‑Württemberg, has for several years been successfully providing employment information and matching job‑seekers with jobs on both sides of the border. 
Cooperation between the French employment authority (Pôle emploi) and the German Federal Employment Agency has not only been increased, but has meanwhile been expanded to five new locations. 
Moreover, in February 2016, the employment ministers of Germany and France, Andrea Nahles and Myriam El Khomri, presented an action plan for Franco‑German vocational mobility. 
Macro‑regional cooperation – a regional approach to policing in the EU 
An approach that works well in the German‑French‑Swiss border region can also serve as model for other regions in the European Union. 
The EU is promoting the development of what are known as European macro‑regions – major supranational areas in which several regions or countries cooperate. 
There are four macro-regional strategies at EU level, three of which Germany is involved in: the Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region of 2009, the Strategy for the Danube Region of 2011 and the new Strategy for the Alpine Region, which was adopted in 2016. 
Efforts to implement this initiative have been under way since the beginning of 2016. 
Cross-border exchange allows hitherto unused potential to be tapped into in regions that are often at a structural disadvantage. 
Naturally, the focus was on the situation in Syria, but also in Ukraine. 
I am very pleased that the National Security Advisor as well as the Secretary of State yesterday gave a clear commitment that America also wants to work on a solution. 
“Abandon it.” This was the advice given by legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright when asked how Pittsburgh could be improved. When the city’s huge steel plants were hit by crisis, it seemed that the glory days of the home of magnates like Carnegie, Flick or Westinghouse were over for good. 
today, Pittsburgh stands for an excellent quality of life, a vibrant, highly innovative start-up scene, and world-class research. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel used his visit to Pittsburgh to get a first-hand view of the drivers of this success. 
Here, the burning of coal and oil seems nothing less than prehistoric, and a return to the days before the Paris climate agreement is inconceivable. 
Gabriel at CMU Robotics © Photothek/Koehler 
At the Energy Innovation Center, Gabriel saw how companies and educational institutions are working hand in hand to advance green technology. 
We have just had our third meeting with Mr McMaster, the US President’s National Security Advisor. 
We must, and this is also America’s interest, prevent further military escalations. We need to ensure that the process in Astana helps achieve a ceasefire, but also that the parties involved begin seriously in Geneva with the process for a new constitution, for elections, and ultimately the Assad Government must be replaced. 
And we need to convince Russia to support this – those were the key points of our conversation today.

Kick-off: Mexico will be the Guest of Honour at Hannover Messe 2018 
Mexicans and Germans are defying the 12-hour flight which separates the two countries and moving ever closer together. 
There have been around 3.4 million visitors to the more than 1000 events during the Year of Germany in Mexico – proof of the lively interest which links the two countries. 
In 2018, Mexico will be the first ever Latin American country to be Guest of Honour at Hannover Messe, the world’s largest industrial trade fair. 
Common positions in the G20 and OECD 
In economic terms, too, Germany and Mexico have many shared interests as industrialised nations. 
Both countries have close ties with the United States and are energetically championing a free and fair world trade order. 
Foreign Ministers Gabriel and Videgaray with the cityscape of Mexico City 
On arrival in Mexico City, the German Foreign Minister first of all had talks with his new Mexican counterpart, Luis Videgaray, before they co-chaired a meeting of the Binational Commission. 
The Commission decided, among other things, that Germany would invest a further 200 million euros in the sphere of environmental and climate protection in Mexico. 
Furthermore, the two countries are working together on a joint university of excellence in the social sciences field. 
Before the Commission convened, the Mexican business confederation (CCE) and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry signed an agreement on closer cooperation in future in the field of vocational training. 
Gabriel with Mexican journalists and the campaign to counter violence against journalists 
Brutal violence against journalists 
In the morning, Foreign Minister Gabriel met representatives of Mexican civil society to find out more about the country’s human rights situation. 
Afterwards, Gabriel expressed his great concern about the scale of violence committed by the drug cartels, who are responsible for more than 20,000 deaths each year. 
The talks focused in particular on the targeted attacks against journalists who report on this issue. 
The Foreign Minister announced that Germany would do more to support Mexican journalists. 
We condemn this test in the strongest possible terms. 
The international community will not slacken its efforts to call on Pyongyang to abide by its commitments emerging from the resolutions of the UN Security Council and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
We therefore welcome the fact that new measures against North Korea are been actively considered in the United Nations. 
The talks with President Peña Nieto and Foreign Minister Videgaray were thus very amicable. 
They are key partners, both within the framework of the G20 and of the OECD. 
Gabriel said that this willingness demonstrated the great confidence which Germany enjoyed in Mexico and he expressly thanked his hosts for that. 
His victory is a sign of the broad-based support among the population for the path of economic and political openness which Iran has been following since the nuclear agreement was reached. 
We want to maintain this enhanced cooperation in areas such as business, science and culture. 
Troops boarding a suspected pirate vessel 
Atalanta is a success story. 
EU NAVFOR – Operation Atalanta 
Up to 600 Bundeswehr service personnel may be deployed in the context of the EU-led operation Atalanta (EU NAVFOR Somalia) until 31 May 2018 at the latest. 
Maintaining success 
However, it is too early to say that the crisis is over. 
In the transitional phase of Atalanta in the years ahead, the Federal Government’s main concern is to ensure that the operation’s success is maintained. 
So Foreign Minister Gabriel was pleased that the German Bundestag voted by a large majority to continue German participation in Atalanta. 
It is vital to ensure that supplies can come in safely by sea, particularly now, when the people are hit by famine. 
The challenges in Somalia were huge, but the progress made in recent years was tangible, the Minister said after his visit in May 2017. This was the first visit to Somalia by a German Foreign Minister. 
before reaffirming: 
“Germany will not only provide help in the current famine, but will also further expand its long-term support.” 
This includes building up state structures and enhancing the security authorities’ capabilities on land and sea. 
Networked approach 
In addition, the Federal Foreign Office is providing substantial humanitarian assistance to help tackle the famine in the Horn of Africa. 
Nineteen EU member states are currently involved in Atalanta, along with three EU partner countries – Serbia, Montenegro and Djibouti. 
Germany has supported Atalanta from the outset by providing ships and/or reconnaissance aircraft as well as staff members.

The list of things which Germany and Mexico have in common is long – as Foreign Minister Gabriel discovered during his visit on Friday (19 May). 
Gabriel said during his visit that Germany was therefore keen to see the Global Agreement between Mexico and the EU updated. 
For example, it wanted to intensify rule-of-law cooperation with Mexicos inter alia by expanding journalist exchange programmes, and to provide the dependants of murdered journalists with financial support. 
During the talks, the Mexican Government expressed its readiness to cooperate with Germany on this. 
The aim is to enhance the capacity of countries in the Horn of Africa and in the Western Indian Ocean to ensure security in their own waters. 
In particular, the task of the seconded experts is to assist the Somali Government in building up its own coastguard. 
Furthermore, the mission will offer advice on legal issues regarding maritime security. 
All in all, the EU can second up to 140 persons to this mission, which is initially set to last two years. 
Contribution towards combating piracy 
Not only trade between Europe and Asia suffers from the impact of piracy. 
Furthermore, piracy jeopardises the import of relief goods, basic supplies and other goods intended for the population, in particular World Food Programme (WFP) supplies to Somalia. 
The priority for the future will be to ensure that the countries of the region can guarantee the safety of shipping after the EU-led operation comes to an end. 
Over recent years, the Federal Government has already started to prepare “the beginning of the end” by continuously reducing the maximum number of German soldiers envisaged for deployment in the mission. 
On 16 July 2012, the European Council decided to launch the non-executive civilian and military EUCAP NESTOR mission (European Union Mission on Regional Maritime Capacity Building in the Horn of Africa). 
The Federal Cabinet made a decision on Germany’s contribution on 15 August. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visited Somalia in April 2017 and saw for himself the terrible situation on the ground. 
The new Government in Mogadishu was determined to tackle these enormous challenges and deserved international support, Gabriel added, 
The key element for sustainable success is stabilisation in Somalia. 
The training is to take place in the various countries, for example in the Seychelles, in Kenya or Tanzania. Due to the difficult security situation on the ground, however, the Somali coastguard is being trained in Djibouti. 
Germany is pursuing a comprehensive approach in Somalia, both at national level and with its international partners, combining instruments of foreign, security and development policy. 
Within the framework of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy, the major pillars of this comprehensive concept, besides Atalanta, are a civilian EU-led mission (EUCAP Somalia) to develop maritime capabilities and EUTM Somalia, a training and advisory mission for the Somali armed forces. 
For the effect on the countries in the region is greater, whether as a result of the threat to local fishing and short sea traffic or whether due to the restricted use of their ports (for instance, in Djibouti, Kenya and Tanzania). 
We work with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue in Nigeria, where we are endeavouring to mediate between Christian and Muslim groups. 
On 18 May 2017 the German Bundestag extended the mandate for the Bundeswehr’s participation in the anti-piracy mission in the Horn of Africa. 
The main task of Operation Atalanta, which commenced in 2008, is to protect vessels being used by the UN World Food Programme for the transportation of humanitarian aid to and from Somalia (WFP) and to prevent piracy off the coast of Somalia. 
While up to 1200 soldiers could be deployed in 2014, the figure had halved by 2016. 
EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) 
Bild: Abschluss … 
Graduation ceremony for the first training course for local trainers 
Since its launch, the operation has been quite a success: with protection from Atalanta, the WFP has been able to transport over four million tonnes of foodstuffs safely to Somalia, and the number of pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa has fallen substantially over the past few years. 
EUTM Mali provides military and training guidance for the Malian armed forces operating under the control of the legitimate civilian government to enable them to carry out missions to restore Mali’s territorial integrity and reduce the threat posed by terrorist groups. 
EUTM Mali does not take part in combat operations.

On 28 January 2015, the German cabinet extended Germany’s participation in EUTM Mali until 31 May 2016 and raised the personnel ceiling from 250 to 350 soldiers. 
The talks focused on Europe’s future. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel following his talks with the General Coordinator of the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian opposition 
I asked Riad Hijab to play a constructive and active role in this context. 
Reforming the eurozone 
The delegation of the opposition is working to ensure this doesn’t happen. They are continuing their serious and constructive engagement for a political solution to the conflict. 
Using the power of religions to foster peace 
The Federal Foreign Office wants to work more closely with faith communities. 
Bild: Teilnehmerinnen, Teilnehmer, Gruppenfoto… 
Participants of the Conference on the Responsibility of Religions for Peace 
We’ve had, and continue to have, consensus with our international partners and the moderate opposition on this point. 
I very much welcome the fact that UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura is currently trying to expedite the negotiation process. 
Success will require a unified opposition that represents the interests of all sections of Syria’s population. 
The most recent round of talks in Geneva has once again demonstrated how the regime is trying to draw out and undermine the negotiations. This means it is all the more important to have a unified and courageous opposition. 
The questions relating to Syria’s future are too important to allow the delaying tactics of the Syrian regime to work. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel invited religious leaders from all over the world to the Federal Foreign Office on Monday (22 May). 
At the start of the conference, Gabriel called on the religions to live up to their responsibility for a peaceful world. 
The Conference on the Responsibility of Religions for Peace marks the start of a new initiative. 
The initiative is based on the idea that almost all religions underline the fundamental importance of peace. 
Bild: AM bei Rede … 
In his speech, Foreign Minister Gabriel said: 
“The viewpoint of faith communities enriches our understanding of an increasingly complex world.” 
“Europe cannot move forward without France and Germany.” 
Fostering peace and stability in concrete terms 
as the aim of the dialogue was not to discuss theology or freedom of religion, but rather to explore how the various faith communities can foster peace and stability in their regions in concrete terms. 
Gabriel stressed that Emmanuel Macron’s election and the new French Government presented a great opportunity not only for France but also for Europe. 
Germany and France therefore wanted to continue to work closely together in Europe, emphasised the two Ministers. 
Gabriel went on to say that the EU was in a difficult state at present. 
Furthermore, peace and stability had to be fostered in Europe’s neighbouring regions. 
Germany and France wanted to continue being close partners in all areas and advancing changes. 
Gabriel stressed that it was important that Franco-German initiatives remained acceptable to other European states. 
With regard to the EU as a whole, the eurozone had to be reformed. 
The economic and financial policies of the member states had to be more closely integrated, for example through a joint eurozone budget. 
Concrete steps should be discussed at the Franco-German Council of Ministers on 13 July. 
Stabilisation in Africa 
Another area in which Germany and France want to cooperate especially closely in future is fostering stabilisation and crisis prevention in Africa. 
Gabriel stated that France was very active in Africa, both in military and political terms, and that Germany wanted to provide support in future and place a special focus on Africa in its cooperation with France. 
I held important talks today with Riad Hijab, especially considering that we are in a decisive phase of the political process. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (22 May) following his talks at the Federal Foreign Office with Riad Hijab, the General Coordinator of the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian opposition: 
The new French Foreign Minister knows Germany well and he stated after the talks that he was pleased his first trip had brought him to Berlin. 
The new French Foreign Minister since 17 May, his first trip abroad only a few days later brought him to Berlin. 
At the same time, we call on those who support the Syrian Regime – Russia and Iran – to work toward cessation of hostilities throughout the country so that secure and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance and aid workers can finally be achieved. 
New initiatives were now needed, for example in the economic and employment spheres, initiatives aimed at safeguarding jobs and combating youth unemployment, as well as securing the EU’s external borders. 
Minister of State Böhmer meets Australian business delegation 
Focus of the talks: 
Minister of State Böhmer today met Dr Andrew Mackenzie, Honorary President of the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and a delegation of Australian business representatives for an intensive exchange of views. 
StM Böhmer… 
The main idea is that the religions speak with – rather than about – each other. 
Minister of State Böhmer meets an Australian business delegation. 
A further aim of the Federal Foreign Office is to expand its foreign policy tools. 
“Religion and faith are not only questions of personal identity – they also define the realities within a society,” Gabriel said. 
In the talks with Mackenzie and the delegation, Böhmer noted that, through the recommendations of the Australia-Germany Advisory Group, the German and Australian Governments have successfully stepped up bilateral relations in recent years: 
It is scarcely possible to understand – let alone resolve – the large number of regional conflicts in today’s world without the viewpoint of the churches and faith communities, he continued. 
Strategic realignment 
Bild: Teilnehmende … 
Talks between the conference participants. The aim is to achieve lasting contacts and exchange among faith communities. 
Almost all of the 59 recommendations of the Advisory Group have now been implemented or are well on the way to being implemented. 
Opening Germany’s foreign policy to greater input from civil society is also part of the strategic realignment of the Federal Foreign Office’s cultural relations and education policy. It involves moving away from foreign policy between countries and towards a foreign policy of societies. 
There has also been major progress in the economic sphere, as Böhmer continued: 
This sphere offers many cooperation opportunities. 
Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the Conference on the Responsibility of Religions for Peace 
“We need to foster the peacemaking potential of religions” (article by Foreign Minister Gabriel in the “Tagesspiegel” of 21 May 2017) 
I am pleased that a cooperation agreement on Industrie 4.0 was recently signed at the HANNOVER MESSE. 
We also launched close cooperation in the renewable energy sector. 
However, the aim of the mission is not to fight piracy directly. 
The first meeting was held in Hamburg at the start of May, the next meeting is planned. 
“I have faith in the great peacemaking potential of all religions,” he said. 
A conference in Berlin today marked the start of this initiative. 
Interfaith dialogue is to become an integral part of a new foreign policy of societies. 
Nevertheless, questions of faith are repeatedly at the heart of conflicts – although the actual causes mostly lie in political or economic issues. 
Honoured guests, 
Gabriel said that the Responsibility of Religions for Peace initiative called on religions to “rise to a challenge”, 
What an impressive sight! 
To this end, the religious leaders are meeting in working groups at the conference to explore how their communities can foster conflict prevention, mediation and reconciliation endeavours. 
Council Decision 2012/389/CFSP of 16 July 2012 (PDF, 452 KB) 
The EUCAP NESTOR mission is another contribution by the EU towards combating piracy off the Horn of Africa and in the Western Indian Ocean. 
Up to five police officers and up to five soldiers take part in the mission as trainers and staff members. 
In line with the recommendations of the Advisory Group, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy signed a declaration of intent on cooperation with Australia in a newly established working group on energy and resources. 
The fact that Perth is to host the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference in November this year is a further clear signal. 
Never before have representatives of so many religions assembled here at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Here with us are members of the great monotheistic religions – Judaism, Islam and Christianity – as well as representatives of various traditions and movements from Europe, the Middle East and North and West Africa.

For Europe’s security 
The EU launched its first mission in 2003: Concordia in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
Since then, civilian experts, police officers and soldiers have helped foster peace and stability in more than 30 missions. 
Third countries such as Serbia, New Zealand and Ukraine have also taken part. 
And not just in Berlin, but also in Wittenberg, Martin Luther’s home town.

New Franco-German initiatives: Foreign Minister Le Drian on first official visit to Berlin 
Just a few days after being appointed, the new French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian met Foreign Minister Gabriel in Berlin. 
Jean-Yves Le Drian met Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Monday (22 May). 
Bild: Gabriel und Le Drian … 
Keen to advance the Franco-German partnership: Gabriel and his counterpart Le Drian 
“France and Germany are not Europe, but Europe cannot move forward without France and Germany,” stated Foreign Minister Gabriel after his talks with his new French opposite number, Jean-Yves Le Drian. 
New colleagues: Foreign Minister Gabriel waiting outside the Federal Foreign Office for Jean-Yves Le Drian 
“This was a good start and I’m looking forward to working together,” summed up Gabriel once the talks had ended. 
Although this was the first meeting between Le Drian and Gabriel as Foreign Ministers, it was not the first time they had met. 
As Defence Minister under President Hollande, Jean-Yves Le Drian frequently visited Berlin. 
This means we are drawing even closer together as strategic partners. We have now had the first 2+2 talks between the foreign and defence ministers and launched an Asia dialogue.” 
“We see Australia as an important partner in the Asia-Pacific region whose values we share. 
“The topic Industrie 4.0 is just as important to Germany as it is to Australia. 
And I can still remember that when I went to school the Catholic and Protestant pupils were segregated. We weren’t meant to sit together. 
We didn’t actually do as we were told – which was probably a good decision! 
This important event coincides with the 40th anniversary of the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce.” 
Industrie 4.0, renewable energies, resources 
500 years after Luther and the Reformation we have arrived at a point where we can reach out to other religions, and can of course embrace ecumenical activities in our own country. 
Germany’s contribution

Civilian experts, police officers, customs officers and Bundeswehr soldiers are involved in almost all CSDP missions and operations. 
Germany is glad that the religions are now at peace in our country. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (23 May) on the attack in Manchester: 
But even now it is clear that 
terrorism remains terrorism, no matter what the motivation behind it. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attack in Manchester 
We stand with the British at this time and our thoughts are with the victims, their families and their friends. 
This is dreadful news coming from Manchester and a perfidious logic that targets first and foremost teenagers, children and young adults at a pop concert. 
This attack hits all mothers and fathers in Europe right in the heart. 
What is important now is to investigate the background to the attack without delay. 
For example in Myanmar, where the Rohingya Muslim minority is being persecuted. 
– The conflict in the Central African Republic is escalating again, in part because the antagonism between Muslim and Christian militias has not yet been resolved. 
– In some Asian countries religious intolerance is on the rise and at times erupts into violence. 
– Even in Europe we are confronted by assassins who carry out horrific attacks in the name of religion. 
Thus, if truth be told, peace does not reign unchallenged here either. 
It is not, however, a new phenomenon. 
And as I said, 
there are examples enough in our recent past, too. 
For it is clear that religion polarises and is made responsible for backwardness and fanaticism, for violence and even for terrorism. 
Not everyone wants religion to have a greater role. 
However I do think that religious stakeholders are also political players in their societies. 
People who merely promote the stereotype that religion always makes conflicts worse are, in my opinion, making a big mistake. 
One example of this is the ATALANTA (EU NAVFOR) operation, which aims to protect merchant ships and supply ships transporting humanitarian aid from pirates off the Horn of Africa. 
The EU exchanges information on the situation along one of the world’s most important shipping routes with the United States, China, Japan, Russia and other countries with ships in the area. 
EU experts are in great demand as monitors to ensure ceasefires are respected (example: the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in Georgia). 
They help to develop the rule of law (example: EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo)). 
They train police officers (EU Police Mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan) and soldiers (EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM) Mali) to a high standard so they can provide for security in their own countries. 
EUPOL … 
– The ancient city of Palmyra lies in ruins because so-called Islamic State wishes to eradicate Syrians’ memory of a millennia-old cultural identity – basing its actions on what I at least consider to be a perverse interpretation of Islam. 
The German Protestant Kirchentag starts the day after tomorrow in Berlin and Wittenberg. 
In reality, things are of course far more complex. Economic, social and political motives are often combined with religious identities to produce an explosive admixture. 
It is important to discover what role religious motives have had or may still play in a conflict. 
However, I firmly believe that we must not stop there. 
We have invited you all here today because 
we want to look closely at the peacemaking potential of religions and at their responsibility for peace in society. 
We want to raise other questions that might help us take a new and fresh look at the topic. 
The member states of the European Union are working together to ensure Europe’s security. 
The EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) was first conceived at the Cologne European Council in June 1999. 
The European Union works together with partners. 
Civilian and military instruments 
When it comes to ensuring Europe’s security, the CSDP is about crisis prevention, crisis management and post-crisis rehabilitation. 
The EU has civilian, police and military instruments at its disposal – from civilian crisis response teams to two operational EU battlegroups. 
Every crisis has its own challenges. 
The members of the German Bundestag are briefed on missions on a regular basis. 
In the case of armed military operations, they hold debates and vote on the Bundestag mandate, which is a prerequisite for such missions. 
For more on CSDP missions and operations click here: 
This is not a theoretical issue. 
No religion is above the constitution. 
Your Eminences, 
So we do need to talk. 
However, in the real world it is religions that are at the heart of many a conflict, be it only because religion has been hijacked by other interests entirely, by people who clothe themselves in religiosity in order to assume political power. 
Such religious strife is also part of our history. 
I have faith in the great peacemaking potential of all religions. 
– And then there is the anti-Islamic, or anti-Muslim, violence in our countries, which threatens members of those religions. 
I think it’s worth looking at the constructive potential of religion and not just its apparently destructive potential which is currently foremost in our minds. 
Over 100 representatives of many different faith communities from 53 countries travelled to Berlin for the dialogue-based event. 
Looking beyond the conference, the Federal Foreign Office therefore aims to build up a network for interfaith dialogue that could serve as an early warning system and the starting point for talks on the ground. 
The Federal Foreign Office already supports interfaith peace projects, such as the Catholic lay movement Community of Sant’Egidio’s projects in Mozambique and Dar al‑Fatwa’s dialogue among Sunnis in Lebanon. 
Explaining to people that Islam is part of Germany is a task that we politicians have not yet managed to complete. 
I think we must face up to this reality. 
We want to do justice to this complexity with our German foreign policy. 
Religions can be a key motor and guide in this endeavour. 
Religious actors can experience failure and futility without sinking into despair. 
They can stand up for fairness and justice in their societies, where others see only friends or foes. 
This makes me think of the vicar general of the Syrian Catholic Church in Baghdad, whom I met recently. 
What a place! 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to Beijing 
On 17 January 2013, the Council of the European Union approved the establishment of an EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) to train Malian soldiers. One month later, on 18 February 2013, it approved the deployment of the mission. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling to Beijing on Tuesday (23 May). 
I was impressed. 
Close political dialogue 
Following a meeting with Monseñor Héctor Fabio Henao Gaviria, the head of Caritas in Colombia, and representatives of the Caritas working group on Colombia, Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (23 May 2017): 
Political encounters between Germany and China are taking place almost on a weekly basis at the present. As recently as the end of April, Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi met for the Strategic Dialogue in Berlin. In February, they met at the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn. 
However, if there is to be lasting peace in Colombia, the country needs an active and committed civil society. 
The Colombian Government has a responsibility to step up its efforts to halt this development and to protect its citizens from violent attacks. 
Only in cooperation with China can a viable solution be found to this issue. 
Cooperation with China is also vital in the area of climate protection, and also on important issues concerning free trade. 
The skyline of Beijing’s Central Business District 
Intensifying political and social relations: 
Germany and China have entertained diplomatic relations for 45 years. Seldom has their political dialogue been as close as in recent times. 
Federal Ministers Zypries, Maas and Müller travelled recently to China, while Premier Li Keqiang is expected in Germany in a few days’ time and President Xi Kinping is to attend the G20 Summit in Hamburg in July. 
These political relations should be intensified. The economic dialogue with China has long since ceased to be the only important factor in relations with China. 
The country also plays a key role in political terms, for example with respect to the conflict on the Korean Peninsula and repeated missile tests by Pyongyang. 
A civil society dialogue seeking to establish a forum for social issues is being held for the first time in the framework of a visit. 
A new forum for social dialogue: 
A high-level dialogue on civil society exchange, which is entitled the People-to-People Dialogue, is to take place on Wednesday. Representatives from the worlds of politics, culture, education, media and civil society will meet within this framework to discuss bilateral social cooperation. 
This cooperation begins in the cultural arena. Four exhibitions are to be organised that will offer insights into the history and culture of both countries. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel will return to Berlin in the early hours of Thursday morning following his talks in Beijing. 
The format will also be used as a platform for discussions on difficult issues. 
Tangible projects are already under way in the area of sports. The Eintracht Frankfurt football team and the Federation of University Sports in China are to cooperate closely in the future – the participants will present this project at the People-to-People Dialogue. 
People-to-People Dialogue 
Alongside the political talks in Beijing, intensifying social relations between Germany and China is a core element of Foreign Minister Gabriel’s first official visit. 
The dialogue is to take place every two years in the future, alternating with the biennial intergovernmental consultations. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights, on Colombia 
Skyline Peking … 
There are obviously forces at work here trying to intimidate committed members of civil society and hinder the success of the peace process. 
Germany is prepared to help Colombia master this challenging task in the fragile post-conflict phase. 
The current demobilisation of the FARC has led to a dangerous power vacuum in the areas previously controlled by the guerillas. 
There are a growing number of reports that other illegal armed groups (“bandas criminales” (BACRIM), paramilitaries or the ELN) are seeking to take control of these areas and are threatening activists who, for example, are championing land rights, and human rights defenders, among others. 
In early May, President Santos made the new Vice President, Oscar Naranjo, responsible for combating the violence against human rights and social activists. 
Germany has been supporting the Colombian peace process for many years, among other things within the context of civil crisis prevention, stabilisation, post-conflict peacebuilding and mediation and, together with partners such as Caritas, is also funding humanitarian assistance projects as well as humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance projects. 
Opening Statement by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the Conference on the Responsibility of Religions for Peace 
Fellow members of the Bundestag, 
It is rare to see such diversity among participants at conferences here in the foreign ministry! 
I am deeply concerned by the reports coming out of Colombia on the increase in politically motivated acts of violence, especially in the areas worst hit by the conflict. 
According to a report published by the office of Colombia’s ombudsman in April 2017, there were 156 murder victims from these groups in a 14-month period between January 2016 and March 2017. 
On 24 November 2016, after more than 50 years, a peace accord was concluded between the Colombian Government and the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) rebels. This agreement has been implemented since 1 December 2016. 
I for one can’t think of any religious group which has not – in its written or oral articles of faith – set itself precisely that goal, namely promoting peace among people and above all with God. 
To that extent, our focus today on the responsibility of religions for peace is almost redundant. 
It’s something that all religions and faith communities have already agreed on. 
But, in my view, we need to talk to each other, not about each other. 
For that reason, Germany’s diplomats are very grateful that so many of you chose to attend this event. 
And not only 500 years ago. 
We all still remember how Northern Ireland was divided for years by a bloody social conflict which pitted Protestants against Catholics. 
This all goes to show that 
However, this anniversary also reminds us that conflicts of interest supposedly based on religion or pursued in the name of religion are not a trait peculiar to other parts of the world. 
And we are glad to see the return of some of the religious life lost during the campaign of terror and extermination waged by the Nazis against Jewish citizens. 
We are very glad that Jewish communities have re-established themselves in our country, because it is by no means self-evident that they should. 
It is precisely when I think of our own past that the title of this event, the “Responsibility of Religions for Peace”, makes me prick up my ears. 
For nowadays we don’t often hear the words peace and religion in the same sentence. 
At first glance, this would seem to be justified. 
And so here, too, we sometimes see how the old demons, most of which have little to do with religion, try to utilise religion in order to promote territorial or political interests. 
The question of religious radicalisation is now very much on our radar, having played a key role in recent attacks. 
For a cruel war raged in Europe from 1618 to 1648, ignited and kept smouldering for religious and other motives. 
I'm saying this to make it clear what histories, what narratives are prone to fix themselves in our minds. 
But it is true that religion polarises. 
I don’t think that we have to decide here and now whether religions have a propensity to foster extremism, or are ambivalent in their effects, or have rather been hijacked when things that horrify us are done in their name. 
Anyone who is active in a religious context in a given country is also part of that society and its political life. 
They too are caught up in worldly affairs, they too can be enmeshed in guilt and error. 
They block out the complexity and the ambivalent effects of religion. 
We should not only ask what religions could do to foster the peaceful coexistence of societies, but also what responsibility they bear for actually doing it! 
Rather, it seems to me that this is a subject we must address as diplomats of a country such as Germany, whose history is closely entwined with faith and religion, whose Basic Law stipulates that it is tolerant of and open towards all religions, but which ultimately retains state neutrality in questions of religion, according freedom to all religions in our country. 
All religions must operate within the framework provided by the constitution. 
We politicians also have a a big role in explaining to everyone that 
freedom of religion and respect for the constitution and other laws are inseparably linked. 
And that this is true even as concerns those aspects of our constitution which vex some religions, such as gender equality and protections for homosexuals. 
At the same time, we have to explain to our populace that the words of our former President Wulff, “Islam is a part of Germany” were not just expressing a theory, but reflect our daily life – all you have to do is to walk out into the street. 
Perhaps it is important precisely for this reason that we, in a country where ever fewer people seem to have faith in God, should concern ourselves with the question of what impact religion has as a factor in international relations. 
For in fact religion is gaining significance worldwide. 
In contrast to what some people think, religion is not disappearing from the modern world. 
We must recognise something that we here in Europe have perhaps forgotten or wilfully ignored: 
religion and faith are not only questions of personal identity – they also often define the realities within a society. 
And naturally these questions of identity and religiosity pay no heed to national borders, especially those drawn sometime in the past century with little regard for local and regional contexts. 
The mandate of EUCAP Sahel Niger was extended by two years on 22 July 2014. 
Germany is seconding civilian experts.

Because of this, religious leaders have a special responsibility not to contribute to radicalisation, division or conflict. 
Don’t get me wrong. 
It is still states who bear the responsibility to act peaceably in their international relations and to adhere to human rights obligations vis-à-vis their citizens at home. 
We want to try, with you, to work out how we can unlock the power of religion wherever societies threaten to drift apart or, worse, where social conflicts flare into violence and civil war. 
For it is my impression that in such situations societies need a great deal of strength, a great deal of courage and a great deal of optimism in order to escape this spiral of escalating violence. 
Above all, they can provide optimism, 
for they have a profound understanding of guilt, forgiveness and reconciliation. 
It probably had more walls and barbed wire than anywhere else in the world. 
But between these walls, in a small church, I met a visionary blessed with incorrigible optimism. 
In the midst of the chaos he maintained good relations with all religious groups, notwithstanding the many conflicts that existed. 
It also illustrates something else. 
Like him, many other religious leaders have a responsibility simply because their words and actions carry great weight in their communities. 
I think that it is first and foremost this responsibility that we must address together. 
When I say that religions should – and can – also assume responsibility, I am not advocating the wholesale removal of the Westphalian order and abdicating responsibility to the religions. 
Information on the European External Action Service website 
What I am advocating is harnessing the strength, knowledge, resilience and long-term vision of religions for practical work to promote peace. 
Information from the Center for International Peace Operations on the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
After the end of the temporary military mission EUFOR RCA (April 2014 to March 2015) which supported the establishment of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the European Union began the EU Military Advisory Mission in the Central African Republic (EUMAM RCA). 
For example, even today, we support the Community of Sant’Egidio’s peace dialogue in Mozambique and the Central African Republic. 
Those are the kind of options we need to explore yet further. 
We can do that best with you. 
You are the real experts. 
Allegations of torture against Iraqi special units 
Iraqi photographer and documentary filmmaker Ali Arkady has been reporting on events in his home country since 2006. 
Der Spiegel has collaborated with Arkady since 2011. 
We also want to integrate such viewpoints more systematically into our foreign policy work. 
For the viewpoint of the Church and religious groups enriches our understanding of an increasingly complex world. 
Those were my last days with the ERD. 
It will take practice for religious leaders and diplomats to find the right forms of cooperation. It won’t come without effort. 
But it will come with time. 
I personally hope it will result in even greater religious literacy on the part of our diplomats. 
We know that all of you gathered here today work for peace – in your societies and in international groups. 
We know that you live up to your responsibilities with authority, fixity of purpose and optimism. 
They all treated me like one of their team. 
You have been doing this for a long time. 
We believe it would be good for the Federal Foreign Office and for Germany to tread this path with you, wherever possible and wherever you desire it. 
Der Spiegel had likewise already reported incidents in which Iraqi security forces arbitrarily arrested, tortured and killed people. 
What we ask of you is to share your expertise with us. 
It was a bizarre situation. 
I began to be afraid. I was a Kurd, working for an American photography agency. 
There were four of them. They were armed. I was alone. 
They kept saying: 
Rescuing shipwrecked refugees is the priority for the crew of the navy ships in the mission. 
“Come on, hit them! Get on with it!” 
As well as combating traffickers and cooperating more with countries of origin and transit, the aim is to prevent refugees drowning in the Mediterranean. 
Nobody knows more about how religions can discharge their responsibility for peace better than you. 
Then I slapped one of the prisoners across the face. 
It was awful, and it was the last thing I did there. 
I told them my daughter was ill and I had to go home. 
The ships help investigate trafficking networks and are authorised to take action against boats being used by traffickers on the high seas. 
Do we have anything to offer that you need? 
The ships also continue to rescue those shipwrecked. 
And, conversely, 
what can you explain to us? 
The mission was named after a girl born on a frigate off the coast of Libya on 24 August 2015 after her mother had been rescued.

If we can do more to support your work, please let us know. 
Now I understand why IS found it so easy to take over Mosul and other Sunni areas. 
The people there were afraid they wouldn’t survive without military protection. 
But ultimately IS made their situation worse. 
Now we live abroad. 
Sometimes I wonder what Omar and Haider think of me now. 
I didn’t break any agreements, didn’t film anything secretly. 
They all watched while I documented their abuse for hours on end. 
And if, at the end of this meeting, you want to continue and meet each other again, then the event will have been a great success. 
And in the case of the brothers they killed, they even said explicitly that I could use those videos for my documentary. 
They had lost all sense of right and wrong. 
In May of last year, Spiegel reporters uncovered evidence of a campaign of expulsion and murder by Shia militias while conducting research in the city of Tuz Khurmatu south of Kirkuk. 
That won’t happen now. 
I wanted to portray them as heroes. 
That won’t happen either. 
It isn’t easy to start a new life somewhere else. 
But I am convinced that religions must assume this responsibility and will be able to live up to it. 
The Federal Foreign Office is already working along those lines. 
Religious groups there have good access, which enables them to identify and negotiate concrete solutions to end the violence. 
We also work with Dar El Fatwa and the Berghof Foundation and support a dialogue among Sunnis on preventing radicalisation in Lebanon – this is preventative action of a most concrete kind. 
These factors are what strengthened our desire to invite you to this meeting. 
That is the price I have to pay, and I’m willing to pay it. 
I trust you will view these two days as an invitation to enter into a lasting relationship, not as a one-off event. 
Since Omar, Haider and the other officers have realised what the publication of their actions might mean for them, I have been receiving threats. 
First came the questions: 
“We need to talk to Ali. Where is he?” 
Here in this room are experienced and well-informed men and women from a wide variety of regions and religions, who could become a tremendous united force for peace. 
Then they became more specific. 
Very specific. 
I hope you will forge lasting contacts here and build on the links you already have. 
The man is running through the steppe, pleading for his life, and they just shoot him while he’s running, they keep shooting even when he’s on the ground. 
I still have it on my phone. 
Not too hard, not too gently. 
Then I brought my family to safety and left Iraq. 
I don’t want to say exactly where for security reasons. 
They even subsequently sent me videos of the murders they had committed when I asked them. 
On 22 May 2013, the Council of the European Union decided to deploy the civilian European Union Integrated Border Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya). 
EUBAM Libya aims to help the Libyan authorities develop capacities to secure the Libyan land, sea and air borders by providing training, guidance and advice. 
In the longer term, the mission is to work on developing and implementing a strategy for integrated border management together with the Libyan authorities.

Witnesses reports of kidnapped relatives tallied with these findings. 
Already at that time, the word was that up to one thousand Sunnis had disappeared from Tuz Khurmatu alone. 
Ali Arkady has now provided such evidence. 
There is no doubt as to the authenticity of his material and the identity of the perpetrators. 
His depictions contrast with the usual reporting on the campaign to liberate Mosul. 
Many reporters had experienced and described the Iraqi armies as liberators until that point. 
Perhaps because they simply didn’t see, or were unable to see, what was happening outside the city? 
The Emergency Response Division that Arkady covered, which is subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, kidnapped its victims not from the liberated city districts of Mosul, but from villages in the vicinity, and always under the cover of darkness when no journalists were on the scene. 
Not heroes, but monsters 
Iraq A photographer accompanies members of a special unit in order to document their fight against IS. 
And suddenly becomes a witness to rape, torture and targeted killings – a report. 
I come from Khanaqin, a small town in northeastern Iraq – where the Kurdish and Arab part of the country intersect. 
Perhaps it was for this reason that I, more so than others, believed that it was possible for Iraqis of different origins to coexist also in the future. 
In October last year, I started out on a project. I wanted to report on two soldiers of the Emergency Response Division (ERD), a military unit of the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. I wanted to document their fight against “Islamic State” (IS). 
That was the plan at any rate. 
Even at that time they talked about how they would kill people. 
But back then, I thought they were just joking. 
But they were buddies, close friends who looked out for each other on the battlefield. 
I accompanied them and filmed them for days. 
The film sought to show that Iraq’s Sunnis and Shiites can stick together in the fight against “Islamic State”. Back then, I set up a Facebook page, which was called Happy Baghdad. I uploaded a two-minute video of the two entitled “Liberators, not destroyers”. 
He is not only an excellent photographer, but his many contacts in the country and numerous documentaries have given him uniquely deep insights into the various conflict regions in Iraq. 
It also shows that we have the right idea – namely, to focus despite this great diversity of religions and faith groups, and their various traditions, backgrounds and cultures, on one issue which all religions at least profess is their common goal: the establishment of peace. 
Of course – and I hope the other guests will forgive me – I would like to extend an especially warm welcome to the representatives of the German churches and religious groups, for the German Protestant Kirchentag, a huge lay-led gathering, is taking place in Berlin this week. 
And I think the Reformation serves to remind us that there have been major conflicts within the Christian Church too. 
And our parents had even been told that in the afternoons, after school, they shouldn’t play together. 
It is unfortunately far more common to hear religion spoken of in connection with conflict or even war. 
At the same time, this means that no religion is above the law in Germany. 
These are things that have evolved in our country. They didn’t come out of nowhere. They have become part of our constitution. 
We have to explain that Muslims are citizens of our country with equal rights, at least that’s how we see it. 
If religious representatives, some of whom have experienced such horrors, look to the future with courage and trust in God in the truest sense of the word, that should give us courage here, too. 
Who better to do such work than those whose scriptures and faiths place such importance on peace? 
I am eager to see what the outcome of this first meeting will be. 
Thank you for coming, and thank you all for helping to make this meeting happen. 
I have faith that you can shoulder it, even if at times some may wish to avoid it because it is so large. 
EU Border Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya) 
On 5 June 2013, the Cabinet took a decision that up to 20 police officers were to be deployed for EUBAM Libya on behalf of the Federal Government. 
EU Capacity Building Mission in Niger (EUCAP Sahel Niger) 
The Council of the European Union decided on 16 July 2012 to establish the civilian mission EU Capacity Building Mission in Niger (EUCAP Sahel Niger). 
EUCAP Sahel Niger aims to help build Niger security forces capacities (National Police, National Guard, National Gendarmerie) by providing training and consultancy and enable the security forces to effectively combat organised crime and terrorism. 
EU Military Advisory Mission in the Central African Republic (EUMAM RCA) 
Since March 2015, EUMAM RCA has been assisting the Defence Ministry and the General Staff by providing strategic consultancy and helped build up the Central African security forces by carrying out non-operative training. 
The aim of EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia is to take action against criminal traffickers who put the lives of thousands of people in danger in unseaworthy dingies and rowing boats in the southern Mediterranean. 
Since June 2015, Germany has been participating in the EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia as part of a European approach. 
The EU ambassadors agreed to rename the operation Sophia after the start of phase two on 7 October. 
This year its focus is on the 500 years since the Reformation, on the renewal of the Church, but also on schism and violence. 
This is the challenge I would like you to rise to, the responsibility I would like you to shoulder. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on Cannes award for Diane Kruger 
The Award for Best Actress to Diane Kruger sends a message against indifference towards the victims of xenophobia. 
preserving historic audio recordings 
Namibia has a rich pop music heritage. 
Members of the research group Stolen Moments Namibia Music History Untold 
The Federal Foreign Office has supported a project to preserve historic audio recordings. 
This musical heritage was in danger of disappearing altogether. 
Preserving musical testimonies for future generations 
Diane Kruger lends her character Katja Sekerci a moving depth and demonstrates the full range of her outstanding skills in her first German-speaking role. 
It is impossible to imagine Germany and Europe without the contribution made by people who left their home countries to make their home here. 
I congratulate Diane Kruger, Fatih Akin and his congenial screenwriter Hark Bohm, and the entire team involved in this film on their great success. 
The Original Jazz Masters and Erna Chimu at the ceremony to celebrate the completion of the project 
The founders of the Stolen Moments Namibia Music History Untold research group, Aino Moongo and Baby Doeseb, set themselves the task of preserving these musical testimonies of the apartheid era for future generations. 
The technical equipment for digitising the recordings was provided within the context of the project. 
She provides a face and voice to Fatih Akin’s film “In the Fade”, and thus to the victims of the NSU murders. 
Finding the courage to build a modern, open society and to live together responsibly is the only answer to renewed nationalism, self‑isolation and marginalisation. 
I’m on the right track, I thought. 
They both agreed to be the “heroes” of my story. 
The aim was to show that it is not only the elite fighters of the Golden Division, but also other units that do remarkable, courageous things. 
Omar and Haider’s troop, the Emergency Response Division, started out small. 
However, from the summer of 2014, when the whole of Iraq was suddenly at war with IS, the division expanded rapidly. 
It was divided into three groups: 
reconnaissance, snipers and the combat group. 
The digitisation of the music storage media has now been largely completed. An important part of Namibian music history has thus been made accessible both to researchers and to the general Namibian public. 
Aldred Dreyer, Chief Technology Officer at NBC, is happy: 
“The project is of great significance for the country and for NBC, and has helped preserve Namibia’s rich cultural heritage.” 
Captain Omar Nazar, a Sunni, and Haider Ali, a Shia sergeant. 
The Federal Foreign Office supports a project to preserve historic audio recordings. 
The men carried out raids and night-time commando operations. 
They had mainly been trained by the Americans. 
During decades of apartheid, not only did Namibian pop music receive no funding from government agencies, it was also controlled and in some cases even suppressed. 
Many audio recordings were often not kept for posterity at all or were saved only on private, fragile storage media, such as audio cassettes. 
A German expert travelled to the country to train Namibian audio technicians, who then digitised numerous recordings and transferred the data to a music database. 
Not only academics but also the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the National Archives of Namibia have access to the music via the database and are helping to revive knowledge about this musical genre, which was almost lost. 
The scenes of torture, rape and targeted killings that Ali Arkady meticulously captured on camera and film over a number of months in the past year have confirmed similar observations by human rights organisations and witness statements. 
On 22 October, Omar’s men came to the base with two young prisoners, who were suspected IS supporters. 
The soldiers told me later on that they had confessed to being IS members after being tortured for three days. 
This was a turning point for my project. 
My “heroes” were doing things that I never thought to be possible. 
When Captain Omar and one of the soldiers started beating other prisoners, they ordered me to join in. 
At first I was only allowed to watch them, but later on they didn’t mind my filming them. 
I drove back home as Omar and Haider had two weeks’ leave. 
I got there before them on 11 November, 
which gave me the opportunity to get to know the other officers and, from then on, even more details – 
At that time, the soldiers had just liberated the village of Kabr al-Abd from IS. 
Captain Thamer al-Duri, who was in charge of the intelligence division, led the raids. 
I was there when they arrested a number of men, including the cleaner at the mosque. 
I met them again in the autumn when the liberation of Mosul began – 
And so the idea to make them the protagonists of a documentary film was born. 
I decided to follow the pair until the end of the war – the liberation of Mosul. 
I took photos of them, but didn’t know what would become of them afterwards. 
The response was overwhelming. The page had 345,815 views and was shared and commented 1360 times. 
My protagonists gained in self-confidence with each battle they won. 
more than I cared to find out and more than I could begin to imagine, 
Raad Hindiya was sleeping together with his family in a single room when they arrested him. 
The soldiers brought him to Captain Omar Nazar, my protagonist, where they tortured him for hours before transporting him to the intelligence service headquarters in the morning, 
where he was tortured for a whole week. 
He was then killed together with other IS suspects. 
That’s what Captain Duri told me later on. 
That proved to be Rashid’s undoing. 
He died after three days of torture; I saw his body at the intelligence service headquarters. 
The small town of Hamam al-Alil had been fully liberated from IS. 
Those who were detained included a father and his 16-year-old son. The soldiers took both of them to their headquarters. 
They hung Mahdi Mahmoud, the father, from the ceiling with his hands behind his head, weighed his back down with a pallet full of bottles of water and began to beat him. 
His son was next door and could hear his father’s screams. 
And I was there filming the scene with my camera. 
No one stopped me. 
Then they beat the son before his father’s eyes 
Why are they letting you film how they torture people? 
But they don’t think like journalists. 
How can this possibly be part of a documentary on the liberation from Islamic State? 
This had become something quite normal for them. 
But even back then Captain Duri told me that he would arrest the man again and kill him in a few days’ time. 
On 22 November, ten men set out, all equipped with night vision equipment. The US troops in the vicinity had been notified and monitored the night-time raid with a drone. 
That same night, they arrested a young man by the name of Rashid, who was innocent, a fact that was even confirmed by the reconnaissance forces of the Iraqi army. 
The ERD teams set out to arrest young men in droves, officially in order to establish whether IS men were among them. 
Things got more and more out of hand. 
At the same time, I told myself, 
you must record what is going on here! 
You must document, provide evidence of what they are doing. You must show that they are committing war crimes. 
At night, it was just me and the troops of the Ministry of the Interior. 
Now they had been arrested again and brought here. 
I was surprised and alarmed that they let me film all of this. 
I stayed for an hour. 
I was surprised that they let me film all of this. 
They even sent me a video of the bodies. 
The soldiers simply headed out without any further explanation or orders from superior officers. 
Once again, I was given permission to tag along. 
The second person that they apprehended that night was a man called Fathi Ahmed Saleh. 
They dragged him out of the room where he had been sleeping with his wife and three children. 
Sergeant Haider Ali entered the room and announced that he would rape his wife. 
I followed the others to see what they were doing with her husband. 
Five minutes later, I happened upon Haider Ali again by the open door. 
The wife was crying. 
Captain Omar Nazar asked him what he had done. 
I filmed the scene in the room where the woman was sitting and holding her youngest child in an embrace. 
She looked at me. 
I kept filming without thinking. 
When I looked at the video later on and when I saw how she looked in my direction and kissed her children, I thought that 
So that people can find out what had happened! 
Meanwhile, the other soldiers plundered the house and stole everything that they could carry. 
He was a Sunni, but the Shiite Hashd don’t like Sunnis. 
We took the men and women, looted the buildings.” 
Their superiors knew everything. 
There was even a sort of competition between the national police force and the unit of the Ministry of the Interior. 
When the policemen told of how they had found and raped a good-looking woman in a house, the ERD men wanted to go there too. 
But no officers were there at night, only the soldiers who were in charge of torturing the detainees. 
They began to abuse the two men, first by beating them and then by stabbing Ahmed behind the ears with a knife over and over again. 
The arrests continued that very same night. 
The soldiers had been given various names by an informer, names of men who had, it was claimed, previously fought for IS. 
she must have come to terms with the fact that I was filming them in this terrible situation. 
They took him to Omar Nazar’s house, where he was raped by one of the soldiers. 
The men who I accompanied had fought long and hard battles. 
They probably thought by now that they were allowed to do anything they wanted. 
Murder, rape – everything is halal or legitimate. 
When they came back from their night-time raids and HQ asked them on the radio what they had done, Captain Omar answered: 
“Okay, do what you have to!” was the reply they got. 
The Americans must also have found out about what was going on for that matter. 
The fight against “Islamic State” increasingly faded into the background. 
I couldn’t stand it any longer. I filmed what was happening, and later I thought, 
that could be my wife, my daughter. 
But it was clear that my life, our lives, would be at risk as soon as I publicised the evidence of these war crimes. 
When I travelled to Qatar on 4 January 2017, all was quiet. 
After my arrival, I contacted Haider Ali via Facebook and asked him whether he could send me the video he had showed me of him and Captain Omar Nazar shooting one of their prisoners in the back. 
“Sure,” Haider wrote back – and sent me the video. 
Refugees from other Iraqi provinces confirmed these kidnappings. However, there was a complete lack of evidence beyond witness statements and abandoned towns. 
It was always part and parcel of everyday life for us that Sunnis, Shias, Kurds and Arabs were living both alongside and with each other. 
I had made the acquaintance of two members of this unit during the liberation of the city of Fallujah in the previous summer. 
They had all the markigs of stereotypical adversaries. 
Captain Omar Nazar commands the combat group in which Haider Ali, a sergeant, is also deployed. 
Colonel Thamer Mohammed Ismail, the ERD commander, gave me permission to accompany the force on its missions. 
The prisoners were killed a week later, they went on. 
We had arranged to meet again at the unit’s new headquarters in Hamam al-Alil, which was somewhat closer to Mosul. 
such as torture, rape and murders of people who were only vaguely suspected of collusion. Or not even that. 
I was there when they arrested a number of men at night, including Raad Hindiya, who worked as a guard and cleaner at the village mosque. 
But his elder brother had joined IS, and also his brother's wife. 
An informer had accused him of being a member of IS. 
First they only took him away for a few hours to beat and interrogate him. 
At the end of October 2016, I was working as a photographer for Der Spiegel and staying with Omar and Haider at the headquarters of the force in Qayyarah, south of Mosul, not far from a US base. 
And then the nightmare began. 
Many of those who had fled the fights came back. 
before killing the son later on. 
What have you got yourself into now?, I thought to myself. 
While foreign reporters were in the region, they only came during the day, and always drove back to the safety of Erbil in the Kurdish region in the afternoon. 
In mid-December, we relocated to the other side of the Tigris, to a new base in Bazwaya on the eastern outskirts of Mosul. 
There were two young brothers, Laith and Ahmed, who had already been arrested once by the Golden Division, but later released for lack of evidence. 
Ali, one of the soldiers, boasted that this was a technique he had learned from American experts. 
The next morning, a soldier told me that both of them had been tortured to death in the course of the previous night, showing me a video of their bodies, which he even sent to me via WhatsApp. 
The two men that I wanted to make the subject of my documentary – Captain Omar Nazar and Sergeant Haider Ali, a Sunni and a Shiite who wanted to fight against IS together – reached Bazwaya on 16 December. 
“Nothing,” said Haider Ali, “she was on her period.” 
The last detainee of the night was a young member of the Poeple's Mobilization Forces or Hashd, as they are known in Arabic, which were also fighting against IS. 
If the men of the special unit had any strategy at all, then it was to strike mortal fear and horror into the hearts of all Sunnis in the region and force them to flee, thereby altering the demographic make-up of northern Iraq. 
I went back to Khanaqin, my home town, but only for a few days. 
Khanaqin is my home. I enjoyed living there. 
But that is the price for my work and the price for publicising what I saw. 
Initially, I wanted to ride with the two of them into Mosul, liberated after a fierce battle, in the last chapter of our shared story. 
Global relevance – German Government seeks international dialogue on migration 
The Federal Foreign Office is stepping up its cooperation on displacement and migration with international organisations. 
Joint engagement 
In addition to tackling the causes of displacement, it is important to provide the countries affected with support in coping with migration flows. 
The overall common goal is to alleviate people’s suffering. 
The Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) provides a way of doing so. 
Germany currently chairs this informal dialogue forum, which is open to all United Nations Member States and serves as a forum for discussing best practice in managed migration. 
The participants of the Third Berlin Round Table agreed today to continue working together in the GFMD. 
Along with Louise Arbour, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration, the event was attended by Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, William Swing, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). 
Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, was also present, as the topic is of relevance to the entire European Union. 
All participants agreed that 
It is also important to create educational and employment opportunities in order to give refugees and internally displaced persons long-term prospects close to their homes.

Two years after the height of the refugee crisis in summer 2015, the issue remains as topical as ever. 
It is all the more important that the international community now learns from recent years and establishes guidelines on displacement and migration. 
Europe needs to play a more significant role and to speak with one voice in order to overcome the causes of displacement. 
“We can only prevent flows of refugees from Africa and the Middle East if we work together to combat climate change, rearmament and religious fanaticism,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said after the event. 
The aim is thus to work more closely together at international level. 
A further aim is to continue the Berlin Round Table dialogue forum in order to step up the German Government’s cooperation with the international organisations represented at the event. 
Following the two previous Berlin Round Table events in 2015 and 2016 on concrete ways of working together on displacement and migration, Foreign Minister Gabriel invited high-level representatives of various international organisations to the Federal Foreign Office once again today. 
In order to find lasting solutions, the EU is already working on a dialogue with countries of origin, for example in the Khartoum Process with countries at the Horn of Africa. 
it is vital to guarantee a minimum level of protection to refugees and displaced people, who often experience great deprivation. 
This goes beyond humanitarian aid, which enables people to live in dignity and safety and alleviates the suffering of those who are currently unable to help themselves. 
At the Third Berlin Round Table on Displacement and Migration, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said today that the aim was to learn together from the challenges of recent years. 
In this context, representatives of East African countries and experts from international organisations last met at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin on 18 and 19 May to discuss the relevant issues.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel after the Berlin Round Table on Refugees and Migration 
The new US Administration’s rejection of western policy consensus is only making the challenges of migration greater. 
Three major factors drive migration: climate change, wars, and political and religious persecution. 
Those who do not oppose this US policy make themselves complicit. 
The short-sighted policies of the US Administration are contrary to the interests of the European Union. 
Obsolescent ideas such as closing borders and building walls will not solve a single problem. 
We can only prevent flows of refugees from Africa and the Middle East if we work together to combat climate change, rearmament and religious fanaticism. 
Any other approach is wishful thinking and does not solve a single problem. 
The Trump Administration wants to quit climate agreements, arm crisis-hit regions and ban people from certain religious groups from entering the US. 
These problems are only becoming greater as a result of the US’ new isolationism. 
Moreover, arms exports increase the risk of war, while ignoring climate change destroys the livelihoods of many peoples. 
If Europeans do not take a resolute stand against this today, the migration flows to Europe will become even larger. 
If the US quits the agreement on climate protection, it will cause further migration flows. 
The link between the impact of climate change and the increase of migration flows is self-evident. 
The drying up of ground, lack of food and an inadequate water supply lead to famine and epidemics – 
Those who do not recognise these mechanisms are not equal to the global challenges of politics. 
Those who accelerate climate change by doing less to protect the environment, sell arms to crisis-hit regions and are not willing to solve religious conflicts by political means thus put peace in Europe at risk. 
We Europeans must fight for more climate protection, religious enlightenment and fewer arms, as the Middle East and Africa will otherwise become further destabilised. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (29 May) on the margins of the Berlin Round Table on Refugees and Migration attended by Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; William Swing, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM); Louise Arbour, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration; Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship. 
and thus to movements of people, who first move from rural areas to cities and then, because it becomes too crowded there, to Europe. 
And in the meantime, many young and easily influenced people are, in the worst case, radicalised religiously. 
The ASEAN Charter, which entered into force on 15 December 2008, injected impetus into the cooperation within ASEAN, particularly in the political and security spheres and in the cultural and social fields. 
ASEAN Plus Three is the name given to the regional framework for dialogue between the ten ASEAN member states and the three East Asian powers China, Japan and South Korea.

Climate protection appeared on APEC’s agenda for the first time at the 15th Summit in Sydney in 2007. 
The Asian coordinators are always one ASEAN state (currently Myanmar) and one non‑ASEAN state (New Zealand, representing the North East South Asia Group – NESA). 
The latest ASEM Summit took place in Ulan Bator in 2016, and the most recent Foreign Ministers Meeting was held in Luxembourg in 2015.

Under the CSCE Final Act, every country in Europe has the right to decide freely whether or not to belong to a security policy alliance. 
The North Atlantic Alliance has an “open door policy”, which means NATO is in principle open to admitting new members. 
Admittance is based on criteria set down in the Washington Treaty, under which NATO nations may, “by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of [the] Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to [the] Treaty”. 
Candidates also have to comply with certain political criteria, including a democratic political system, a market economy and the desire to resolve conflicts through peaceful means. 
accession ceremony 
At the beginning of June, Montenegro will officially join NATO. 
Montenegro’s joining of NATO marks the culmination of a long process. 
After all, the country received the invitation from the NATO Foreign Ministers to enter into accession negotiations with the alliance on 2 December 2015. 
Its foundation was considered to be a predominantly symbolic step on the path toward an internal market with free movement of goods and capital and freedom of movement for workers. 
Following the successful conclusion of the accession talks, the Protocol of Accession between Montenegro and NATO was signed in Brussels on 19 May 2016. 
Since then, Montenegro has enjoyed observer status in the alliance and has participated in almost all sessions but without the right to vote. 
The German instrument of ratification 
How the accession process works 
Now, the processes of all 28 allies have been completed. 
On 28 April 2017, the Montenegrin Parliament likewise approved the country’s application to join NATO. 
Although the country’s accession will only formally come into effect when Montenegro’s instrument of ratification has been deposited in Washington, at the special NATO meeting on 25 May Prime Minister Marković already had a seat at the table in alphabetical order between Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 
The second Cabinet decision on the Federal Government’s bill was taken on 24 August 2016, which formed the basis for starting the process for the law approving the Protocol of Accession in the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. 
The first reading in the Bundestag took place on 20 and 21 October without a debate, and the second and third readings on 1 and 2 December 2016. The Bundesrat granted its approval on 10 February 2017. 
The law was promulgated on 10 March (publication in the Federal Law Gazette). 
In Germany, two Cabinet decisions were required to implement the membership invitation, of which the first was taken on 20 April 2016 to approve the signing of the Protocol of Accession by the NATO Foreign Ministers. 
Intensifying the strategic partnership

A key partner for cyber policy 
One area in which Germany and India cooperate very closely is cyber policy. 
This is why, at this year’s intergovernmental consultations, Foreign Minister Gabriel and Mobashar Jawed Akbar, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, signed a joint declaration of intent on continued cooperation in the sphere of cyber foreign policy. 
Regular consultations on cyber issues 
The Indo-German intergovernmental consultations in Berlin – 
strengthening cyber cooperation 
The fourth Indo-German intergovernmental consultations took place in Berlin on 29 and 30 May. 
Germany and India want to intensify their strategic partnership, including with regard to cyber policy. 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with delegations from both countries 
Germany and India have many close ties: 
To deepen this partnership, 
the German and Indian Governments have held consultations every two years since 2011. The meetings take place alternately in India and in Germany. 
This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany.

In this regard, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Iraq in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. 
At the start of the fasting month of Ramadan, we see once again that nothing is sacred to ISIS. 
The document envisages cooperation to foster the development of maritime infrastructure, the sustainable use of the seas and the protection of marine biodiversity, as well as greater collaboration in the marine sciences.

It is thus all the more important that the terrorists’ control be brought to a swift end. 
After the meeting, Minister of State Roth issued the following statement: 
Minister of State Roth is Commissioner for Franco-German Cooperation and coordinates bilateral projects with his French counterpart. 
The talks focused on the preparations for the Franco-German Council of Ministers in July as well as strengthening bilateral relations. 
My meeting with Marielle de Sarnez showed that we are entering into a new phase in Franco-German relations with the Macron Administration. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (30 May) on the attacks in central Baghdad in which at least 27 innocent people were killed and many people seriously injured: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is to meet Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs of Indonesia, for talks in the Federal Foreign Office on Wednesday, 31 May. 
The two men will sign a declaration of intent on the maritime agenda. 
The priority must be to open up new educational opportunities and career prospects to young people. 
We also want to further strengthen bilateral cooperation. 
Fostering language skills will play just as crucial a role as the expansion of cross-border mobility. 
I am certain that Franco-German friendship will serve as a model for the whole of Europe. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth met his new French counterpart, Minister for European Affairs Marielle de Sarnez, at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin today (30 May). 
In a joint declaration of intent, the two countries specified measures to be implemented in the speres of cyber foreign policy, IT security and the fight against cybercrime. 
Germany is India’s most important trading partner in the EU, the largest German Chamber of Commerce Abroad is located in India, and more than 13,000 Indian men and women are enrolled at German universities. 
The two countries have maintained a strategic partnership since 2000, and they cooperate closely on issues such as vocational training, sustainable urban development and renewables, as well as in the sphere of science. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel also participated in the intergovernmental consultations. 
Germany and India wish to jointly enhance IT security as well as cooperate in the fight against cyber crime. 
Moreover, both countries want to work to ensure respect for human rights, and to maintain peace and security, in cyberspace. In so doing, they are visibly setting an important example for other countries to follow. 
The last consultations took place in New Delhi in November 2016. Ambassador Fitschen, Director for International Cyber Policy at the Federal Foreign Office, has invited the Indian delegation to come to Berlin for the 2017 consultations. 
We agree that we can make Europe stronger, more socially just and more rooted in solidarity, primarily by launching new initiatives together at European level. 
The Franco-German Council of Ministers will provide key impetus for this in Paris on 13 July. 
Its member states decided to establish the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in November 2015. 
The EAS complements the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which primarily focuses on economic and financial policy issues.

German School Rio de Janeiro wins German School Prize award – Minister of State Böhmer congratulates 
German schools abroad have been able to take part in the competition since 2016. 
The jury was highly impressed by the schools in Rio and Boston in the six spheres inspected. 
This year, the German School Boston was also in the top 20, which underwent a close on-site inspection by the experts of the jury over the course of two days. 
That this assessment is shared by pupils and their families at both schools is evident from the tough competition for places and the level of satisfaction among all those connected with these schools with their performance in terms of the quality of teaching, learning outcomes, how they deal with diversity, the participation of pupils and parents, the support system for pupils and the management skills of senior staff.

Chancellor Angela Merkel presented the award. 
German School Prize The German School Prize has been awarded since 2006 by the Robert Bosch Foundation and the Heidehof Foundation together with Stern magazine and the public broadcaster ARD. 
With an award ceremony broadcast on television, thus attracting considerable attention, the aim of the sponsors of the most prestigious of all German school prizes and indeed the best-endowed with prize money totalling more than 200,000 euros, is to recognise those schools which do outstanding work in dealing with social, local and educational challenges. 
The 140 German schools abroad have been eligible to enter the competition since last year. 
The International German School in Johannesburg was among the winners in 2016. 
Elisabeth Selbert Vocational School in Hameln won the first prize of 100,000 euros this year. 
The five runner‑up prizes of 25,000 euros each went to the Waldparkschule in Heidelberg, Kirchheim Grammar School near Munich, Borchshöhe Primary School in Bremen, the European School in Bornheim and the German School in Rio de Janeiro.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has served as a trans-Asian platform for economic dialogue between the countries in the Pacific region since 1989. 
In 1994, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established to provide a framework primarily for security policy dialogue at foreign minister level. 
The three largest economies in the region – China, Japan and South Korea – have also been represented in multilateral regional structures through ASEAN Plus Three since 1997. 
In addition, there are the regional organisations of South Asia (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, SAARC), the Pacific (Pacific Islands Forum, PIF), and Central Asia (Shanghai Cooperation Organization, SCO), as well as supraregional forums for dialogue such as the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and various subregional associations such as the Mekong River Commission (MRC) launched by the Mekong riparian states. 
The establishment of a group of permanent representatives of the ASEAN states in Jakarta is an important step towards more effectively institutionalised cooperation. 
The objective was to achieve this internal market by the end of 2015. 
Civil-society engagement in Egypt has always played a major role in fostering the country’s development. 
However, the new law creates significant obstacles. 
The new NGO Act goes in the opposite direction. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the NGO Law in Egypt 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement today (31 May) on the NGO Law that entered into force in Egypt yesterday: 
I am very concerned about the NGO Law that entered into force in Egypt yesterday. 
This legislation massively curtails the rights and privileges of civil-society organisations, while freedom of the press is also being increasingly restricted. 
Respect for human rights, a free press and a free civil society are prerequisites for social harmony and lasting stability. 
Particularly in the current situation, Egypt needs an active civil society more than ever. 
ASEAN Plus Three was formed in the late 1990s in response to the Asian financial crisis and works mainly on economic, trade and financial policy, as well as on environmental and health issues. 
The ARF deals with security issues and is the only institutionalised security-policy discussion forum in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Egypt must create conditions in which its civil society can work unimpeded to make its contribution, which is important for the future of the country. 
Members of the SCO have conducted joint military manoeuvres on multiple occasions in recent years. 
The grouping was founded in 1996 on the initiative of Singapore and France, and has expanded from its original membership of 26 to include 53 members today. 
At their summit in Bogor (Indonesia) in 1994, the APEC countries agreed to set up a free trade area within the economic community (Bogor Goals). 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was founded in 1967 and now has ten member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam). 
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) was established on the initiative of Singapore and France in 1996. Originally numbering 26 members, it now has 53 partners from Europe and Asia. 
In addition, various other ministers meet under ASEM auspices to discuss matters falling within their remits, such as financial, transport, environmental, educational or scientific affairs.

Speech by Minister of State Michael Roth at the opening of the WDR Europaforum 
Welcome to the Federal Foreign Office and to the twentieth WDR Europaforum! 
In May 2016, the title of the WDR Forum was “Europe without Europeans?” 
At the time, we were faced with a Europe that was at risk of sinking into a mire of crises and populism, 
A year later, we can be somewhat more optimistic. 
Emmanuel Macron conducted a pro-European election campaign – and he won! 
And we have also made good progress as regards overcoming the refugee crisis, even if we still have a lot of work ahead of us. 
However, an inventory of the past year also includes the fact that the United Kingdom decided to leave the EU. 
This risk has not come to pass so far. 
In the report, President Juncker clearly distanced himself from the scenario of reducing Europe to “nothing but the single market”, and I would like to do the same thing here 
We need to coordinate our work on economic, social and employment policy in a better and more binding way. 
Let’s be honest, 
Secondly, we are keen to see a union of solidarity. 
Instead, we should promote education and employment in such a way that people see the entire EU as a community of freedom, social justice, fair opportunities and prosperity. 
Above all, we need to do even more for young people, 
We have to see overcoming the refugee crisis as a joint European task and create an effective asylum and migration policy based on humanity and solidarity. 
All of this raises the question 
Should the EU accept it when a few members hold up – indeed, block – the EU’s further development? 
When we talk about the future Europe today, this also concerns Germany’s role in Europe. 
We need to correct this distorted image, and we want to correct it. 
In his message to the WDR Europaforum, Jean-Claude Juncker described 2017 as a “world moment” that will decide the fate of our continent. 
I can only agree with that. 
In electing Emmanuel Macron, the French expressed their commitment to Europe. 
Now it is up to us to play our part in ensuring that Europe continues to move towards open-mindedness, solidarity and unity, 
and thus to a European future. 
In this spirit, allow me to welcome you once again to the Federal Foreign Office. I hope that we will all enjoy productive, indeed heated, discussions. 
I am delighted to be able to welcome you to our ministry today. 
a Europe where fear of losing control was omnipresent. 
Some of us even wondered if the EU had a future at all in its current form, 
fortunately plenty of people still believe in Europe, 
as shown by the recent elections in our neighbouring countries. 
In many places in Europe, people are taking to the streets and gathering in squares to express their support for the EU. 
Many people in Europe feared this step could encourage others to follow suit. 
At any rate, the EU’s united stance on Brexit is encouraging. 
should we have more or less Europe? 
How do we want to take the EU forward to make it fit for the future? 
The European Commission outlined five scenarios in the White Paper on the Future of Europe it published in March. 
because this approach would certainly not make Europe fit for the future. 
Instead, we need “more Europe” in certain fields in order to make the EU even better. 
First of all, we have to complete the monetary union so that it can be a guarantor of growth, solidarity and stability for everyone. 
voluntary agreements, to which no-one feels bound, will not achieve anything. 
We can prevent a race to the bottom with regard to social benefits by implementing minimum social standards in Europe. 
We do not want to content ourselves with the fact that prosperity is only found in a few places in Europe. 
And fourthly, we should enhance internal and external security in order to protect our freedom from terrorists and take on greater responsibility for our own security against external threats. 
of how we deal with the fact that some Member States are probably not willing to take further steps. 
Or should those who want to move forward do so more resolutely in the future as a team of European cheerleaders, so to speak? 
That is one of the questions inextricably linked with the question of more or less Europe. 
Some Member States saw Germany as too dominant and judgemental in recent years. 
In saying this, I do not mean that Germany should not pursue its own interests in Europe. 
But if Europe is to function, Germany, as the largest Member State, must be willing to put European interests above its national interests at times. 
Our democracy depends on precisely this type of constructive wrangling on the future of Europe. 
In a few days’ time, Montenegro will be officially welcomed as a member of NATO. 
In a few days’ time, Montenegro will be officially welcomed to NATO as the 29th member of the alliance. 
The twenty-eight NATO allies voted in favour of the country’s accession, and the Montenegrin parliament, too, has given its approval. 
The accession process required all NATO member states to ratify the Protocol of Accession and to deposit an instrument of ratification in Washington, where the Treaty was signed. 
In Germany, the law was made public on 10 March, and the German Embassy in Washington deposited the instrument of ratification on 3 May 2017. 
Europe is experiencing economic growth. 
Today, in June 2017, we can say that 
the Brexit vote brought home to the remaining 27 EU Member States what they gain from the EU. 
A stronger institutional bulwark, whether in the form of a eurozone minister, its own budget or a eurozone parliament, is needed. 
for success in reducing youth unemployment and creating opportunities will be crucial if the EU is to win back the trust it has lost. 
We could also ask the question of whether Germany should play a greater or lesser role in Europe. 
Germany must once again take on responsibility in Europe as a mediator and connecting force and help to bring about European solutions. 
This year’s WDR Europaforum has thus chosen the right time to ask what the next steps should be – 
In the end, it was not Wilders or Le Pen, but rather the pro‑European forces who won the elections in the Netherlands and France. 
Let’s start by looking back at where we were a year ago. 
Support for the European project was increasingly eroding. 
The United States and Russia have been full members of the EAS process since the EAS Summit in 2011. 
APEC currently has 21 “member economies”: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Viet Nam.

A decision to establish a Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure was taken at the SCO Summit in Tashkent in 2004. 
Economic and political cooperation is not yet so well-established in the Asia-Pacific region as it is in Europe. 
Many states believe it is important to keep their own distinct economic and political profile. 
That said, diverse regional cooperation structures are emerging in this region, too. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), founded in 1967, enjoys special status in the region. 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
Cooperation in ASEAN to date has focused on economic integration. 
The Charter provides a foundation for the further development of the ASEAN community and gives ASEAN a legal personality. 
It also records the ASEAN states’ commitment to the rule of law, democracy and good governance and envisages the formation of a human rights body. 
It is now also possible for third states to accredit ambassadors to ASEAN. 
The German Ambassador to Indonesia fulfils this function for Germany. 
ASEAN Plus Three 
The multilateral cooperation of ASEAN Plus Three has also found expression in a number of agreements. 
For instance, ASEAN has free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. 
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) 
Afghanistan has been the eighth member since 2007. 
Together with China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, the EU attended the SAARC Summit as an observer for the first time in New Delhi in 2007. 
SAARC itself has had observer status at the UN since December 2004. 
SAARC concentrates on economic and trade issues. 
The agreement to create the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which entered into force in 2006, marked a milestone in regional economic cooperation. 
SAFTA has been ratified by all member states. 
Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) 
It provides a forum for dialogue and cooperation on politics, economics, environment, culture, education and social affairs. 
Moreover, it is the only multilateral forum in the Pacific region to also look at security-policy aspects. 
PIF’s 16 member states are: Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. 
The EU is one of 14 dialogue partners for the PIF (the others include China, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States). 
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) 
Mongolia, India, Iran and Pakistan became “observers” in 2004/05, Belarus and Sri Lanka “dialogue partners” in 2009. 
Turkmenistan is not a member of the SCO, on the grounds of its “permanent neutrality”, but attends Summits as a special guest of honour. 
The SCO has held observer status at the United Nations since December 2004. 
Furthermore, it maintains cooperation agreements with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Now, however, other areas such as economic and trade issues also feature. 
The SCO’s focuses today are subjects such as stability in the region, the fight against terrorism, “separatism and extremism” and energy security issues. 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
APEC was founded in 1989 on the initiative of Japan and Australia and 
aims to strengthen economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, not least by dismantling tariffs and other barriers to trade. 
Summits at head of state and government level are held annually with the participation of business executives. 
Together these economies account for some 55% of global GDP and some 45% of global trade. 
ASEAN Plus Three is the name given to the regional framework for dialogue between the ten ASEAN member states and the three East Asian powers China, Japan and South Korea.

Security situation and repatriation to Afghanistan 
They have created more than 400,000 jobs in Germany alone! 
Putting their lives on the line, journalists work to ensure conflicts such as the one in Yemen do not become forgotten conflicts. 
I call upon all conflicting parties to guarantee the safety of journalists and respect freedom of the press. 
We call upon all parties to lay down their weapons, grant humanitarian access and return to the negotiating table. 
Only a political solution can end the humanitarian crisis in Yemen once and for all. 
Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement is detrimental to economic growth – and to the key life resources of future generations. 
Yemen is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. 
The United States is doing injury to itself, to us Europeans and to all other peoples of this world. 
Those who deny climate change and do not combat it will not only have to deal with the consequences of ever more extreme storms, droughts and floods, but this “not with me” strategy also impedes economic growth and technical progress. 
Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is also a political mistake, as it undermines legal certainty at international level.

Our sound climate policy and our intensive international cooperation with other countries to protect the climate have already forged a strong alliance against the isolationist approach of the new US Administration to climate issues. 
Following the devastating attack on the German Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul, Foreign Minister Gabriel took the initiative to have the situation reassessed. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s assessments are one of the important factors in decisions by German administrative authorities and courts on recognising or rejecting asylum applications and on repatriating rejected applicants. 
Major nations such as China, Brazil, India and Russia stand shoulder to shoulder with us, as do the many countries which are particularly hard hit by climate change, such as the African states and the small island states.

“The land of the free and the home of the brave” is acting contrary to its own principles and thereby setting itself against a worldwide consensus. 
We all support the Paris Agreement. 
We will keep the door open to the United States should it wish to accede to the Agreement again at a later date. 
Let us not be swayed by the short-sightedness of a single party. 
The international community must stick together. 
We trust that the new government will now begin to decisively implement urgently needed reforms, so that the political crisis can be overcome and new impetus given to the Euro‑Atlantic integration of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
Climate policy is a policy for peace. 
Sigmar Gabriel Brigitte Zypries Heiko Maas Andrea Nahles Federal Minister Federal Minister Federal Minister Federal Minister 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (1 June 2017): 
“We welcome that the parliament in Skopje has endorsed a new government in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
The Federal Government, the Länder and German organisations are involved in a host of projects aiming to improve social systems, the ecological situation and the legal system in China. 
At the SCO Summit in Beijing in June 2012, Afghanistan, which had attended SCO Summits as a special guest for several years, was granted observer status, and Turkey obtained dialogue partner status. 
Saving energy and using free resources such as the sun and the wind would still be a great economic success, even if there were no such thing as climate change. 
The principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is intended to ensure security and certainty. 
And let’s not forget that even in America there are a crop of federal states, local administrations and companies who have assumed a pioneering role in climate policy. 
Late May 2017 in Beijing: 
the two Foreign Ministers Sigmar Gabriel and Wang Yi 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to Berlin for the first German‑Chinese intergovernmental consultations in June 2011. 
The third German‑Chinese intergovernmental consultations held in Berlin in October 2014 focused on the bilateral Innovation Partnership. 
Here, the Plan of Action on German‑Chinese Cooperation on Joint Innovation was agreed for the coming years and 2015 was declared the Year of Innovation. 
In 2015, China was the CeBIT partner country. 
This is to the benefit of German‑Chinese cooperation as a whole, including its economic dimension. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel (Social Democratic Party of Germany) and Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière (Christian Democratic Union of Germany) have agreed on behalf of the German Government that the situation in Afghanistan should be reassessed. 
It has been possible to repatriate rejected asylum seekers so far on the basis of the current assessment. 
Until then, rejected asylum seekers will be helped to return to Afghanistan voluntarily. 
Until the situation has been reassessed, rejected asylum seekers will only be forcibly repatriated in the case of criminals, individuals who pose a terrorist threat, or people who categorically refuse to allow their identity to be established. (In 2016, 67 people were forcibly repatriated.) 
Such decisions will be made on a case‑by‑case basis. 
In 2016, as many as 3300 people returned of their own volition. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, today (1 June) issued the following statement on the death of three journalists in Yemen: 
I utterly condemn the attack in which the three photojournalists Taqi al-Din al-Huthaifi, Wael al-Absi and Sa’ad al-Nadhari were killed and two other journalists injured near the town of Taiz. 
Given the continued deterioration of what is already a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Yemen, there is no time to lose. 
On 26 May, the three photojournalists Taqi al-Din al-Huthaifi, Wael al-Absi and Sa’ad al-Nadhari were killed and two other journalists injured near the town of Taiz in southwest Yemen. 
According to Reporters without Borders, five journalists were killed last year either in a targetted attack or while doing their job. In 2015, the figure was six. 
In 2016, 16 journalists were kidnapped, in 2015 thirteen. 
According to the United Nations, Yemen is home to one of the world’s most serious humanitarian crises. 
Some 18.8 million people are dependent on humanitarian assistance, the country is witnessing an acute cholera outbreak and famine is a serious threat. 
With Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Bärbel Kofler as patron, the #nichtvergessen (don’t forget) initiative launched by the Federal Foreign Office along with several aid organisations aims to draw more attention to crises such as the one in Yemen. 
On 12 April 2017, the German cabinet adopted the 2016 Annual Disarmament Report (Bundestag printed paper no. 18/11968). 
The programme provides 200 scholarships for Syrian refugees who, having completed a language course, commenced their studies (BA, MA, or doctorate) at 60 universities in the 2015/16 winter semester. 
North Rhine‑Westphalia is funding another 21 scholarships, and Baden‑Württemberg has set up its own scholarship programme for 50 Syrian students. 
In addition, all 271 scholarship holders are obliged to undertake a support course in good governance, civil society and project management at the University of Konstanz. 
Taking on responsibility in difficult times – 
“By deciding to assume the OSCE Chairmanship in 2016, the Federal Government took on responsibility in difficult times. 
German-Russian relations: historical responsibility 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is visiting St Petersburg today (2 June). 
Iran’s nuclear programme 
The Siege of Leningrad by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War lasted almost 900 days. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is visiting St Petersburg, as the city has been called again since 1991, today (2 June). 
“We cannot allow something like this to ever happen again. 
Relations between Russia and Europe are not always easy at the moment. 
Germany and Russia have many ties 
of both an economic and a cultural nature. 
The second visit on the Foreign Minister’s schedule will thus be to the State Hermitage Museum, where an exhibition by German artist Anselm Kiefer is currently on display. 
“On 16 January 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified that Iran had scaled back its nuclear programme to the level specified in the Vienna Agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPoA). 
The title of the exhibition, “Fates of Nations”, also points to the close ties between Germany and Russia. 
Keeping the channels of communication open 
Bild: … im März 2017… Foreign Minister Gabriel already met his Russian counterpart Lavrov in March 2017. 
Germany has much in common with the EU’s eastern neighbour. 
“We need forums like this where we can exchange views. 
These topics are on the agenda of the two Foreign Ministers’ political talks. 
Learning from the past 
Almost 75 years ago to the day, a symphony that would become a legend was played in the midst of the cannon fire in the besieged city of Leningrad. 
The music, Symphony No. 7 (“Leningrad”) by Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, will always be associated with the history of the city 
Bild: Ehrenmal… Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad © dpa/picture alliance 
The blockade and fighting claimed the lives of over one million people. 
We must not forfeit the achievements we have made in German-Russian relations since then.” 
Differences and common ground 
Gabriel will thus visit the St Petersburg International Economic Forum today. 
Russian President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov will also attend the International Economic Forum. 
It is said that Shostakovich’s Leningrad symphony could also be heard in the German soldiers’ trenches. 
and is a symbol of the resistance against the oppression by the occupying power. 
Since then, Iran has been subject to the strongest IAEA verification and monitoring measures in the world.” 
Use of chemical weapons in Syria 
In 2016, the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations continued to conduct its investigations into the use of chemical weapons and concluded that, in three instances, the Syrian regime had used toxic chemicals in 2014 and 2015. 
The complete report can be read here: 
Annual Disarmament Report for 2016 (PDF, 1 MB) 
It is thus all the more important to keep the channels of dialogue and cooperation open. 
We must try to rebuild the trust in German-Russian relations that has been shaken by the events in Ukraine.” 
The situation in Eastern Ukraine and Syria, as well as climate change, are currently of particular importance and urgently call for international cooperation. 
Eastern Ukraine and Syria are conflicts on which Germany and Russia repeatedly try to find common ground.

Statement by Minister of State Böhmer on UNESCO World Heritage Day 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, issued the following statement today (4 June) on UNESCO World Heritage Day: 
Germany takes on international responsibility in this field. 
For example, it founded the Archaeological Heritage Network to pool German expertise on cultural preservation and to deploy this expertise worldwide in cooperation with organisations such as UNESCO. 
Russia Coordinator Erler on charges brought against Valentina Cherevatenko 
In the project, Stunde Null: A Future after the Crisis, Germany is supporting the documentation of Syria’s cultural heritage and its possible reconstruction. 
they don’t want to harm their country. 
On World Heritage day, the German Commission for UNESCO and the German UNESCO World Heritage Sites Association present their aims and activities to the general public with the aim of enabling people to experience world heritage for themselves. 
they also help to build bridges, reveal common ground, and convey identity and stability. 
Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (3 June) on the charges brought by the Russian judiciary against Valentina Cherevatenko, human rights activist and head of the non-governmental organisation Women of the Don: 
Germany will remain committed to preserving world heritage, as this field concerns us all. 
German UNESCO World Heritage Day was launched in 2005. 
I am very concerned about the charges brought against the renowned civil society activist Valentina Cherevatenko, a winner of the 2016 Franco‑German Prize for Human Rights. 
The aim is to pay tribute to German World Heritage sites as places where cultural heritage is carefully preserved and to boost their role in communicating the ideas behind UNESCO. 
At the same time, a possible conviction would be a blow to civil society cooperation between our countries. 
I very much hope that it doesn’t come to that. 
Civil society cooperation should be promoted and not impeded. 
UNESCO World Heritage sites do not only attest to the unique creativity and outstanding achievements of the past – 
In addition, smear campaigns are being launched to defame and criminalise people who courageously stand up for human rights. 
on the one hand we have civil societies throughout the world which are today stronger, more confident and better connected than ever before. 
If convicted, she may face a fine or a prison sentence of up to two years. 
The winner of the 2016 Franco-German Prize for Human Rights is accused of having cooperated with a German foundation for one of her projects, without voluntarily registering the Women of the Don as a “foreign agent”. 
Cherevatenko takes part in the civil society working group of the Petersburg dialogue. 
At the same time, however, the attempts to silence them are growing ever more perfidious and sophisticated. 
A German partner organisation has secured Eastern Partnership funding for a Ukrainian‑Russian dialogue project that the NGO Women of the Don is supposed to help implement. 
The Federal Government has signalled to the Russian side on repeated occasions that it would be disproportionate to prosecute Cherevatenko for the actions of which she stands accused. 
We need to speak out against it! 
Those who are engaged in defending human rights need our protection, our solidarity and our support for their courageous, dedicated work. 
The Federal Government will continue to keep a close eye on this case and stand up for Ms Cherevatenko. 
The music, Symphony No. 7 (“Leningrad”) by Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, will always be associated with the history of the city

At the Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad, he recalled one of the most brutal chapters in the history of the world. 
On Friday (2 June), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel visited St Petersburg, as the city has been called again since 1991. 
Even after over 70 years since the end of the Second World World, Leningrad’s history serves to remind us that blockades are not the way forward and that we must try to maintain dialogue wherever possible. 
This music remains a symbol of opposition to war, terror and violence. 
Germany’s cultural preservation programme supports the conservation of cultural heritage in over 140 countries. 
In Mali, for example, Germany has helped to save centuries‑old Islamic manuscripts from Timbuktu. 
The slogan of this year’s World Heritage Day is “UNESCO World Heritage Unites Us”. 
A large number of UNESCO World Heritage sites will offer a wide‑ranging cultural programme, special guided tours and activities about world heritage. 
Gespräch mit Putin … Talks on current conflicts: Sigmar Gabriel met Vladimir Putin © Truschel/photothek.net 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had exchanged differing views during their bilateral meeting. 
In the long term, we cannot leave the people in eastern Ukraine in this disastrous situation.” 
The title of the exhibition, “Fates of Nations”, also points to the close ties between Germany and Russia. 
“Time and again, it is amazing that the people of Russia are friendly towards us Germans today although so many crimes were committed here in our country’s name,” he said. 
environmentalists, women’s rights activists, artists, academics, journalists and lawyers. 
Keeping the channels of communication open 
However, in one area the situation is becoming increasingly dramatic: 
“The fact that we must try to achieve a solution to the Ukraine conflict is ultimately also in the interests of the Russian side. 
A further item on the Foreign Minister’s schedule was thus a visit to the State Hermitage Museum, where an exhibition by German artist Anselm Kiefer is currently on display.

What is the Federal Government doing specifically to strengthen civil society worldwide? 
Charges were brought against Valentina Cherevatenko, head of the NGO Women of the Don, on 2 June 2017. 
First criminal proceedings had been initiated in accordance with the “Foreign Agents” legislation (Article 330.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) on 22 June 2016 and were not communicated to her until 27 June 2016. 
If convicted, she may face a prison sentence of up to two years. 
The Federal Foreign Office's location in Berlin 
In Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, the Baltic region and South-Eastern Europe we are creating opportunities for meetings with LGBTI activists in the premises of our missions abroad and promoting local networks. 
We send observers into the courtrooms where questionable trials are being held. 
And of course we address the issue regularly in dialogue with other governments. 
In other cases we engage in direct talks behind closed doors. 
For the German Government, disarmament and arms control are cornerstones of Germany’s foreign and security policy. 
In mid-2016, then Federal Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called for a relaunch of conventional arms control, with the aim of enhancing stability, predictability and military transparency – in short, creating greater security – for Europe and preventing an imminent arms race.” 
In return, the nuclear-deal-related sanctions of the UN, the US and the EU were lifted. 
“In 2016, as well, there have been recurring reports of chemical weapons use in Syria – especially chlorine gas. 
The Federal Government urged that these systematic abuses must have consequences and therefore actively campaigned for a decision to this effect by the OPCW Executive Council, which was approved on 11 November 2016.” 
We always proceed as the specific situation requires and in the way that is best for those affected. 
Because our guiding principle is this: 
we don’t want to cause any harm to those we desire to protect from violations of human rights. 
And to this end we need to talk to particularly difficult partners – China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and also Turkey. 
Breaking off relations, cancelling trips and finger-wagging through our media –anyone who thinks that’s how foreign policy works has got it wrong. 
We coordinate closely with representatives of civil society, for they often have a much better idea of what strategy would be most effective in the country concerned. 
For this we need partners who work persistently and courageously on the issues that concern them. 
Here in this room are representatives of some of our most important civil society partners in Germany and abroad. 
Thank you for our good cooperation and for your advice! 
In our work for LGBTI rights we continually here pointed criticism. 
Don’t you have other problems? 
Is it really worthwhile, really necessary to work for “these minorities”? 
Why do we need special rights and privileges for minorities? 
That is why it is all the more important that we emphasise again and again that 
we are not calling for minority rights, but for the effective protection of the human rights of everyone – regardless of their background, the colour of their skin, their religion, their gender or their sexual identity. 
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” That is the wording of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. 
It may be one of the most important sentences that has ever been written. 
However, we do have grounds for optimism. 
In the past few years we have also seen impressive progress. 
There are encouraging developments on all continents – whether in South Africa or in Uruguay, in Nepal or in Montenegro. 
It is gratifying that in many countries public support for LGBTI rights is growing. 
And where do we stand in Germany? 
Well, the Federal Foreign Office is not necessarily the place to shed light on German domestic policy. 
But we need to view ourselves critically and ask ourselves 
how we are doing when it comes to implementing human rights. 
Whether in Berlin and Bad Hersfeld or in Budapest, St Petersburg and Timbuktu. 
Since then, much has been achieved. 
On various occasions courts had to put politicians under pressure. 
Marriage for all is not available. 
Not yet. 
there are various views on this issue among the coalition parties. 
But full equality by opening up marriage to all will also come to Germany very soon. 
For everyone. 
Let us fight to ensure that the space for civil society’s courageous and important engagement does not shrink any further, but that it can grow. 
How we can do that most effectively is what we want to discuss with you today. 
Speech by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth at the opening of the conference “Time to react – Strengthening the scope of civil society to act” 
Barely any issue has been discussed so much in human rights circles as the diminishing space for civil society to act. 
That initially sounds harmless enough, almost technical. 
“Leave no stone unturned” – Foreign Minister Gabriel visits Turkey for political talks 
Yet this phrase actually denotes much more. 
Talks on the stationing of Bundeswehr soldiers in İncirlik 
It isn’t just about organisational problems. 
It is about activists who are being harassed and threatened, imprisoned and abused. 
However, his mission had a larger overall aim, namely 
Gabriel mit … Amtskollegen Sigmar Gabriel with his Turkish counterpart © Trutschel/photothek.net 
In many countries in the world we have seen in the past few years how new legislation is hindering and hampering the work of civil society. 
That is despite that fact that they need these funds to continue their work on the ground. 
As a result, Bundeswehr soldiers could no longer be stationed at this base. 
Interest in improving relations 
NGOs are being denounced in law as “foreign agents”, they are even being mentioned in the same breath as high treason – and yet these organisations are actually fighting for quite the opposite: 
They want to improve it and move it forward. 
Irrespective of İncirlik, relations were “in troubled waters overall”, Gabriel said after his visit. 
At the same time, he made clear that the fundamental principles of the rule of law were non-negotiable for Germany and reiterated his condemnation of the imprisonment of German journalists in Turkey. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to Turkey on Monday (5 June) to negotiate once again on a general right for Members of the German Bundestag to visit Bundeswehr soldiers stationed in İncirlik. 
to end the wrangling in order to improve relations with Turkey. 
Yes, even in some EU member states we are unfortunately seeing trends of this nature which continually breach our shared values. 
All this applies to the most diverse representatives of civil society: 
It is undoubtedly no coincidence that this discussion keeps flaring up especially with regard to the issue of LGBTI rights. 
Following talks with his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Gabriel made clear that domestic policy reasons in Turkey precluded general visiting rights. 
The fact that this final attempt to reach agreement was all the more important for bilateral relations is shown by the wide range of differences of opinion between Germany and Turkey. 
For this reason, the withdrawal of the German troops must be conducted as amicably as possible in order to continue exchange on these difficult topics. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said the aim was to “prevent a situation in which we completely lose contact”. 
“I have the impression that we need far more talks,” he said. 
We want to use the momentum we can feel here in Germany and throughout the world to support those who are facing opposition in their home countries. 
He made use of the bilateral talks in Ankara to state his views clearly and thus to try to find common ground. 
At a meeting with one of Deniz Yücel’s lawyers, Gabriel asked about Yücel’s conditions in prison and promised further support. 
At the end of his trip, Foreign Minister Gabriel met Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, chairperson of CHP, the largest Turkish opposition party. 
…Gespräch… Gabriel talking to the Turkish opposition leader © Trutschel/photothek.net 
Diminishing space – our first thought is of NGOs which have to wrestle with day‑to‑day organisational problems: the cost of qualified staff is increasing, affordable office space is becoming more scarce, deadlines for project applications are becoming tighter, forms are becoming longer and more complicated. 
So much more that sometimes I wonder whether we ought to adapt our choice of words. 
It is about oppression and persecution, about massive violations of the human rights of all those who work to promote the rule of law and tolerance, a vibrant democracy and a diverse society. 
It is being made difficult for non‑governmental organisations to accept money from abroad, and in some cases they are being prohibited from doing so. 
In far too many countries, freedom of opinion, of the press and of assembly is restricted, sometimes citing the public order or “a harmonious society” as a reason, sometimes under bizarre pretexts such as the protection of minors. 
Likewise, the independence of the judiciary and the right to a fair trial are being curtailed in more and more countries. 
At times it seems like a competition: 
We are observing these developments in a large number of autocracies – today we will hear several examples of this – but we are also seeing them in democracies. 
We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this! 
Lasting stability cannot be achieved without a free civil society and respect for human rights. 
Unhampered dialogue with the various groups within civil society is in no way a threat to national security. 
freedom of expression strengthens a society and makes it more resistant. 
The concrete situation of lesbian, gay, bi‑, trans‑ and intersexual people is like a seismograph of the general human rights situation in a country. 
In countries in which the state discriminates against and persecutes people on the grounds of their sexual identity, this generally goes hand in hand with a broad attack on their people’s civil liberties. 
On the other hand, in states that take a decisive stand against discrimination against LGBTI, we regularly also see progress in the general human rights situation. 
The question of who they love affects a person particularly deeply. 
A state that has the audacity to encroach on the privacy of its citizens in this essential issue will not accept any limits on its intervention anywhere else. 
We are working across the globe to counteract the diminishing space for civil society to act and are supporting human rights defenders under oppression through a wide range of projects. 
For example, in Northern Russia we are supporting the construction of an LGBTI network by providing courses on legal issues. 
In Ukraine we are promoting an LGBTI organisation that is using creative approaches to foster tolerance and respect among the general public. 
Sometimes with clear public words which criticise abuse in no uncertain terms – as was the case recently with respect to the shocking reports on severe breaches of human rights with regard to homosexuals in Chechnya. 
Shouting through a loudspeaker rarely helps victims of human rights violations in the long term; we are more likely to be effective by engaging in confidential talks. 
That is not a luxury but the implementation of a principle that we agreed on almost 70 years ago: 
This is a high aim that is, unfortunately, still far from being a reality even today. 
In recent years I have taken part in Pride Parades in Bucharest and Belgrade. On 8 July I will be in Budapest. Only a few years ago such events would have been inconceivable in these cities. 
It is part of our self‑image as a globally minded and tolerant ministry that we work to promote greater understanding for and tolerance towards minorities of all kinds. 
In Germany, same‑sex couples have been able to enter into a civil partnership since 2001. 
Now, I’m not giving away any secrets when I say that 
I am confident about this, because although there is not yet a political majority, there is a stable majority in favour of it in society. 
Together let us work to make the high standards set down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a reality throughout the world. 
The G20 Finance, Labour, Health and Agriculture Ministers, as well as those responsible for digital policy, also met in the run-up to the Summit. 
The key issues of the German G20 Presidency also dominated the meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers which took place in Bonn on 16 and 17 February. 
The highlight of the German G20 Presidency will be the Summit of Heads of State and Government being held in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July 2017, the twelfth summit since this format was established. 
At the invitation of Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel, the G20 Foreign Ministers, some other invited states and various international organisations discussed issues relating to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, peacekeeping, crisis prevention, stabilisation as well as enhanced cooperation with Africa. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement on the conflict in the Arabian Peninsula to the “Handelsblatt” newspaper: 
We are surprised by the vehemence with which the conflict between neighbouring countries has broken out in the Arabian Peninsula. 
I am very concerned about the dramatic escalation of the situation and the consequences for the entire region. 
No one stands to benefit from a further escalation. 
The Middle East is a political and military powder keg. 
Religious, ethnic, political and ideological conflicts are now also dividing the Gulf monarchies. 
That policy is completely wrong, and it is certainly not Germany’s policy. 
The Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister is in Berlin today. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the conflict in the Arabian Peninsula 
Through the nuclear agreement with Iran, we banished the danger of a nuclear arms race in the region for the foreseeable future. 
US President Trump’s latest gigantic arms deals with the Gulf monarchies increase the risk of a new arms race. 
The Middle East faces enormous challenges – the fight against IS, the terrible war in Syria, the foreseeable impact of climate change and demographic developments are only some of these challenges. 
A serious dispute among neighbours is actually the last thing the region needs. 
I am sure that we will find out more about Saudi Arabia’s reasons for its exceptionally tough stance. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the abduction and detention of an Azerbaijani journalist 
This case must therefore be investigated quickly and transparently, both by the Georgian and Azerbaijani sides. 
In this connection, I welcome the investigation already instigated by the Georgian Government. 
The following day he re-appeared in the Azerbaijani capital Baku, since when he has been detained by the police there. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement today in reaction to reports concerning the abduction from Georgia of the Azerbaijani journalist Afgan Mukhtarli and his unlawful detention in Azerbaijan: 
The Azerbaijani journalist Afghan Mukhtarli, who lives in Georgia, disappeared from the Georgian capital Tbilisi on the evening of 29 May 2017. 
I am deeply concerned by reports concerning the abduction of the Azerbaijani journalist Afgan Mukhtarli, who was living in exile in Georgia, and his unlawful detention by Azerbaijan’s security authorities. 
Mukhtarli is living in exile in Georgia due to the repeated pressure to which he as a critical journalist has been subjected by the Azerbaijani authorities. 
Both the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights state that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attacks in Tehran 
Once again, unscrupulous criminals have killed many innocent people. 
We share in the grief of the people in Iran. 
We extend our condolences to the families of the victims. 
We hope that the many people injured will make a swift and full recovery. 
I condemn the attacks in the Iranian parliament building and at the mausoleum of revolutionary leader Khomeini in the strongest possible terms. 
Escalation is in nobody’s interest: 
Unfortunately, so are many of the victims.

An Islamic State terrorist with a handgun 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (7 June) on the attacks in Tehran: 
Controversial debate on Facebook 
Where terror knows no bounds, there must be no limits to our empathy and humanity. 
Every year, hundreds of thousands of people fall victim to firearms. 
However, the Facebook page of the Federal Foreign Office has in fact received quite a few critical comments, for example: 
Without firearms, how are we supposed to protect ourselves from terrorists? 
Is this an attack on hunters and recreational users of firearms? 
Of course, this campaign does not aim to disarm police officers or disband the Federal Armed Forces. 
What about arms exports? 
Gabriel also commented that a way of resuming dialogue had to be found, in everybody’s interest. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Year of Germany in Mexico 
This weekend, the Year of Germany in Mexico draws to a close. 
IS terrorist militia can only be fought if we stand united 
More than 20,000 guests are expected to attend the final open-air concert in Mexico City to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Year of Germany. 
In this connection, Foreign Minister Gabriel made the following statement today (7 June): 
Germany, too, would like to help achieve this. 
no items can be exported without an export license. 
Because these countries and Germany form a defence alliance, such exports also help to protect us. 
Through the Year of Germany in Mexico we have been able to expand this partnership considerably with more than 1300 events across the country and in the process convey a multifaceted image of Germany - from a political, economic and above all cultural perspective. 
Exports to third countries outside of these alliances are subjected to particularly thorough examination. 
The Gulf region faces huge challenges, what with the conflicts in Syria, the Middle East and Yemen, and the need to combat the IS terrorist militia. 
Speaking about the actions to politically isolate the State of Qatar, Gabriel noted that a conflict had erupted with “astonishing vehemence” between the neighbours on the Arabian Peninsula. 
Given the tense situation there, “a serious dispute among neighbours is actually the last thing the region needs,” Gabriel said before the meeting. 
At a time when conditions are growing harsher, when fundamental principles of order are being called into question, we need to strive more than ever before to bring people together across borders. 
The need to maintain peace, security and stability are key factors in this regard. 
Stability saves lives 
That is why, alongside traditional diplomacy, we are focusing on a foreign policy of societies that does precisely this. 
“Wherever we can do anything to help, we will do it,” Gabriel promised. 
With the Year of Germany in the United States planned for 2018, we intend to resolutely continue this approach. 
that failing states and instability can claim countless lives. 
and that trust must now be restored. 
To achieve stable state structures, state security forces must be properly equipped. 
The Year of Germany is a Federal Government project, with the Federal Foreign Office in the lead role, coordinated by the Goethe-Institut and implemented in partnership with the Federation of German Industries. 
More than 1300 events attracting almost 4.5 million visitors took place throughout Mexico.

The focal topics covered an entire 360° perspective and included the following areas: 
mobility and urbanism, scientific and cultural co-production, industry 4.0, digital culture, sustainability and climate protection. 
Exhibitions, concerns, symposia, workshops and cooperation partnerships for the Year of Germany attracted considerable interest, particularly from young Mexicans. 
How can the campaign be reconciled with arms exports? 
Other highlights included the German industrial trade fair “Hecho en Alemania”, the Science Tunnel created by the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (MPG), an exhibition on biodiversity in cooperation with the Botanical Gardens in Berlin, Germany as the guest country at the DesignWeek Mexico, the German sustainability week and German participation in the most important Mexican film festivals. 
Professor Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, President of the Goethe-Institut: 
The Goethe-Institut, which has been responsible for coordinating the Year of Germany in Mexico, is particularly satisfied with the positive response to the Year of Germany, which has been extraordinarily well received far beyond Mexico City. 
Throughout the country we have seen cooperation between all social groups. 
Calling out around the world to join the movement against gun violence 
Using handguns is so easy that many who fire them are younger than their weapon. 
Mexico is not only a key business partner for Germany but also a reliable ally on issues of international trade and climate policy. 
German enterprises organised more than 500 events during the Year of Germany and presented themselves convincingly as providers of state-of-the-art technology and sustainable solutions. 
The final concert to celebrate the end of the Year of Germany in Mexico on 9 June will feature the Munich DJ duo Schlachthof Bronx and the famous Mexican bands Nortec Collective and Celso Piña at the Monumento de la Revolución in Mexico City. 
The Pop-Up Tour will take place from 9 to 11 June and will incorporate an interactive, varied programme for all the family. 
One would therefore not expect a call to join the movement against gun violence to meet with much opposition. 
Combating illegal trade in small arms 
Two fundamental principles are key in this regard: 
Strict rules must be adhered to, and every individual case is carefully examined. 
The restrictive granting of export licenses is therefore fully in line with Germany’s efforts to promote peace and disarmament. 
During the Week of Action, the Federal Foreign Office and its missions abroad are presenting a selection of their projects.

The situation on the Arabian Peninsula and the decision taken by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar were the focus of talks between Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his Saudi Arabian counterpart Adel al‑Jubeir on Wednesday (7 June). 
The region itself is moreover deeply split on matters of religion, world view and ethnicity as well as on geopolitical issues. 
A strong and united Counter‑ISIS Coalition 
“We in Germany and Europe have an interest in seeing that the situation in the Gulf region does not escalate further,” Foreign Minister Gabriel stressed after his talks with his Saudi counterpart al‑Jubeir. 
Gabriel went on to say that the quarrel between partners would ultimately only strengthen the enemy. 
This applied in particular to the fight against IS, Gabriel continued. IS could only be defeated, he said, if the Counter‑ISIS Coalition held together and demonstrated unity in word, deed and political direction. 
Germany to contribute to de‑escalation 
Germany also supported all steps towards de‑escalation, he added. 
Gabriel stressed that there had been a huge loss of trust on all sides, 
Gabriel and al-Jubeir: 
Gabriel reported that intensive international mediation efforts were already under way to de‑escalate the situation,thanks for example to Kuwait. 
When taking a closer look, there is also an explanation for the apparent contradiction between the Federal Government’s action on small arms and its record of authorising arms exports. 
The life cycle of a handgun is, on average, 30 to 50 years. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to Libya 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (8 June) on his arrival in Tripoli: 
Our objective is therefore – together with the Libyan people – to brace ourselves against the tide of instability that has emerged in the absence of sound structures. 
Germany and Mexico work as close partners to shape global issues of the future, not least in the G20 under the German Presidency. 
Far too many of the 875 million small arms in circulation worldwide were traded illegally and have fallen into the wrong hands. 
An international event – the Global Week of Action Against Gun Violence – is drawing attention to this problem. The Federal Foreign Office and many of its missions abroad are participating in the campaign. 
It seeks to support the UN Programme of Action on illicit trade in small arms, so that criminals and terrorists are prevented from obtaining weapons. 
So this in no way affects state security forces or law‑abiding shooting associations. 
A large share of arms exports goes to our EU and NATO partners. 
Sad examples in Somalia, Libya, and IS‑controlled territories in Syria and Iraq demonstrate, time and again, 
These range from disarming FARC guerrillas in Colombia to controlling firearms used by private security services to reducing the stockpile of surplus arms in Central and Eastern Europe that date from the Cold War era. 
The UN Programme of Action on illicit trade in small arms 
Not isolation, but only cooperation and dialogue will help us to make progress on resolving global issues. 
Germany and Libya: bilateral relations 
It is part of the German-Mexican Año Dual, with the motto “Alliance for the Future”. 
From the Otto Dix exhibition “Violence and Passion”, through live concerts performed by electro musicians from Berlin, to a “Pop-Up Tour” through the whole of Mexico, the broad-based programme enabled visitors to gain interesting insights and enjoy special experiences. 
It was not just a one-off extravaganza; cultural and educational exchange between the two countries has been intensified more permanently, with the result that something of what has been achieved will remain: ties between artists, civil society prospects and projects in the fields of science and business. 
Professor Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries: 
We are looking to the Government of National Accord under Prime Minister Sarraj in this regard. 
In order to achieve our aims, Libya’s deeply divided forces must demonstrate a willingness to compromise and, at long last, commence serious talks on how to implement the Political Agreement. 
Just a few days ago, we tabled a motion in the Bundestag to extend the mandate for EUNAVFOR MED. 
Many migrants are also in a desperate situation on dry land. 
And it was with this in mind that we responded to the most recent appeal by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which urgently called for further funds. 
“In Libya, we are witnessing the tremendous political, humanitarian and security policy consequences of the conflicts in the Middle East in sharp relief. 
We also call on the High Council of State, the House of Representatives and the forces in eastern Libya not to boycott this dialogue. 
We are already contributing the lion’s share of the International Organization for Migration’s 100 million euro regional programme over the next three years. 
For this, it is important that we European partners are on the same page and speak out on Libya with one voice. 
Turning a blind eye is likewise not an option when it comes to migration and the human lives hanging in the balance. 
The European Union has declared its intention to fight human trafficking, 
and German servicemen and women are making an important contribution to this mission. 
Meanwhile, forced migration, displacement and migration are a consequence that has a direct impact on us. 
We will support UNHCR with an additional 3.5 million euros by 2018.” 
German-African concert at the Federal Foreign Office with Wolfgang Niedecken (BAP) and Eric Wainaina (Kenya) 
Wolfgang Niedecken has a special connection to Africa. 
Together with the children’s charity World Vision, he founded the aid programme REBOUND, which supports former child soldiers in the Congo. 
With this first, the two musicians are promoting relations between both countries and cultures as well as cross-border cultural co-production through the medium of music. 
State Secretary Walter Lindner will also take part in the performance as an expression of his close affinity with Africa. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has issued an invitation to a summer concert with BAP founder Wolfgang Niedecken and Kenyan singer Eric Wainaina. It is entitled “Welcome Africa – Köln meets Kenia” and is taking place at the Federal Foreign Office on Monday (12 June). 
Eric Wainaina has won such accolades as the pan-African music award KORA and has been involved in social projects also beyond Kenya’s borders. 
The Federal Foreign Office is supporting the Compact with Africa initiative as part of the G20 Africa Partnership. 
His detention raises serious questions about the rule of law.

I was deeply concerned to learn of yesterday’s announcement by the government of the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq regarding a referendum on independence. 
In today’s world, Alexander’s holistic view of nature is highly topical once again, as is 
Wilhelm’s commitment to academic freedom. 
Calling the unity of Iraq into question, or even wanting to redraw national boundaries, is not the right path. This would only exacerbate an already difficult and unstable situation, both in Erbil and in Baghdad. 
We can fly through space and send robots to explore other planets in our solar system. 
The fight against ISIS has not yet been won. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the announcement of a referendum on independence by Kurds in northern Iraq 
We can only warn against taking one-sided action concerning this matter. 
During a visit to Tripoli, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (8 June) on the announcement by the government of the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq to hold a referendum on independence on 25 September. 
It is only through joint action that we will be able to successfully take the next and maybe most significant steps, as well as tackle the challenges we now face. 
Without willingness to cooperate, or by working against one another, these important tasks cannot be accomplished.

His “Cosmos” lectures in Berlin were open to all – not just to members of the university, but also to any individuals interested in the topic. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is travelling to Libya on Thursday (8 June) because the country’s instability also poses a threat to its neighbouring countries. 
“Our objective is – together with the Libyan people – to brace ourselves against the tide of instability that has emerged in the absence of sound structures.” 
A willingness to compromise is needed 
Sigmar Gabriel met Fayez al-Sarraj, Chairman of the Presidential Council in Libya 
“Only then will it be possible to calm the fighting and, in the medium term, achieve order and statehood.” 
“Tangible progress is urgently needed – both in terms of building up professional national security forces and in the economic sphere.” 
Looking away is not an option 
Bild: AM … wird begrüßt… 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is welcomed by his Libyan counterpart 
At least a million migrants and refugees are stuck in Libya, some of whom are being detained under catastrophic conditions by human traffickers. 
“An initial, pressing task is therefore to improve the shameful living conditions in the detention centres.” 
To this end, Foreign Minister Gabriel announced that Germany would provide further funding in addition to the planned contribution to the International Organization for Migration’s 100-million-euro regional programme. 
“Forced migration, displacement and migration are a consequence that has a direct impact on us,” Gabriel said. 
Libya is far away. 
We all stand to benefit from stabilisation in the country. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel at the start of his trip 
Bilateral relations with Libya 
I call on all sides to engage in dialogue, settle issues by mutual agreement, and in particular stop aggravating conflicts, above all in the territories that are disputed between Erbil and Baghdad. 
This must not be carelessly put at risk now. 
Libya’s deeply estranged forces must now show a willingness to compromise in order to stabilise the country. 
It is true that Germany is funding a large number of reconstruction and stabilisation projects in Libya. 
Let us stand united against this, let us strengthen cooperation around the world, wherever we can, and in this endeavour let us place our trust in science and reason. 
Following the overthrow of dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi, the country has split into zones controlled by rival militia groups. 
On Friday, 9 June 2017, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will visit the Jewish cemetery in Goslar’s Glockengießerstraße together with Yehuda Teichtal, Rabbi of the Jewish Community of Berlin and head of the Jüdisches Bildungszentrum – Rohr Chabad Center. 
The lack of state structures also opened the gateway to Islamist terror militia such as “Islamic State”, which has been able to increase its influence in Libya.

In order to bring about stability, Libya’s estranged forces must conduct serious talks on implementing the Political Agreement adopted in 2015. 
“We will provide UNHCR with an additional 3.5 million euros by 2018.” 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (editions of 8 June 2017) on the arrest of the Chair of the human rights organisation, Amnesty International Turkey: 
I am shocked by the arrest of Taner Kılıç, the Chair of Amnesty International Turkey. 
Amnesty International’s work has played a key role in recent years in raising public awareness of problematic developments in Turkey, particularly as regards the rule of law. 
Mr Kılıç is a human rights defender and lawyer, who has worked fearlessly to have human rights upheld in Turkey. 
I expect the Turkish judiciary to conclude the investigative work rapidly and with the necessary impartiality. 
“Responsibility of religions for peace” conference at the Federal Foreign Office on 22 May 2017 
In discussions on Germany’s engagement in Libya, which is profoundly fragmented by internal power struggles, people frequently say “Libya is far away – what does it have to do with us?” 
The example of Libya shows clearly how closely foreign policy and development policy are often interlinked. 
Bild: AM Gabriel im Cockpit … 
“In Libya, we are witnessing the tremendous political, humanitarian and security policy consequences of the conflicts in the Middle East in sharp relief,” Gabriel said on his arrival in Tripoli. 
For this reason, Sigmar Gabriel also travelled to Tripoli with a message for Prime Minister Sarraj: 
It was no less a figure than Alexander von Humboldt who, as the first Chancellor of the Order, played a key role in shaping the civil class in its early years. 
“all are in like degree designed for freedom.” As a scientist, Humboldt was one of the first to realise what impact human actions could have on the ecological balance, having seen 
the catastrophic effects of deforestation around Lake Valencia in Venezuela. 
Freedom is the first and indispensable condition for such development.” 
And recently academics did precisely that, when they took to the streets in various university towns, including Berlin, to make their voices heard. 
By the way, Alexander von Humboldt was ahead of his time in this respect, too. 
We have already reached a point of which Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt could only have dreamed: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel will open the Forum together with Nobel Peace Laureate Martti Ahtisaari and Sara Mazur, Vice President of Ericsson. 
Connectivity: extensive cooperation among the Baltic Sea states 
Following his talks with Qatari Foreign Minister Al-Thani, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (9 June): 
The play is a good symbol of how religious issues should not be questions that divide humanity. 
I gave my colleague an Arabic edition of the book. 
The theme of this year’s Forum is connectivity. This is a central idea underpinning cooperation around the Baltic Sea. 
There are already far too many conflicts in the region. 
Germany has good relations with all of the Gulf states. 
The hope is that successful cooperation on concrete projects will also help improve the political climate. 
That will also affect the German and international economy. 
Fehmarn Sound Bridge

the terrorists from Islamic State. 
We must stick together in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS! 
Issues include reducing pollution in the Baltic Sea and expanding tourism and infrastructure, as well as sustainable economic development and digitalisation. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel after his talks with Qatari Foreign Minister Al-Thani 
“As I am unable to be in Berlin today, we thought it would be good to meet here in Wolfenbüttel, where Lessing wrote the play ‘Nathan the Wise’. 
This is a very symbolic place here. 
Naturally, we are interested in seeing the conflicts there resolved peacefully. 
Blockades and breaking off diplomatic relations are a difficult decision that will mainly affect the people in Qatar – food and much more are at stake. 
But most of all, we recall that breaking off talks and not speaking with one another led to dreadful outcomes in European history. 
Next year will mark the centenary of the end of the First World War, and historians who have researched this topic have always said that people slept their way into the war because there was a lack of diplomacy and a lack of talks. 
Project presentations and interactive modules, a film presentation and funding speed-dating all await visitors in the Connectivity Lounge. 
We firmly believe that now is the time for diplomacy 
and that we and our colleagues from Qatar and the region must try to find solutions, particularly to end the sea and air blockade and then to solve the problems in the regions. 
Along with our European friends, we will do everything in our power to ensure that this conflict does not escalate further, but instead is resolved as quickly as possible, and to concentrate on the actual opponent – 
Further information about this event is available at 
With regard to the issue at hand, both the international community and Germany are very concerned about what is happening in the Gulf region. 
Qatar is part of this coalition, and we do not want major disputes to weaken it. 
The conflicts there are already large enough – we only need to think of Yemen or Syria. And I have just returned from Libya.

The EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) brings the three Baltic States and Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and Germany together with Norway, Belarus and north-western Russia, and is an example of successful and practical cooperation on the part of the EU. 
Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the attack in Kabul on 31 May 2017 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (9 June) on the attack in Kabul on 31 May 2017: 
“This terrible act must not go unpunished. 
We are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of our staff. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel spoke with President Ghani by telephone a few days ago and promised him our support in investigating the attack. 
The Federal Public Prosecutor General has started investigations. 
German experts will travel to Afghanistan as soon as possible. 
Old and new conflicts 
Germany will continue to stand firmly by its side.” 
Sigmar Gabriel shows his Qatari counterpart Al-Thani the first edition of Nathan the Wise. 
The attack claimed the lives of over 150 people, including two Afghan employees of a security company who were guarding the German Embassy. 
That is also necessary to prevent something like this happening again. 
In order to solve this crime, there must be close and effective international cooperation with the Afghan authorities and all other countries affected. 
We must stand up to terrorism together. 
It is important now that the people of Afghanistan do not allow themselves to be incited and divided by such attacks and that the Afghan Government takes united and resolute action. 
Gabriel is deeply concerned about the fact that the State of Qatar is being isolated by a number of Arabic countries, led by Saudi Arabia: 
“The conflicts there are already large enough – we only need to think of Yemen or Syria. 
What we certainly do not need at the moment is for the disputes to escalate – especially between the Gulf states.” 
The German Foreign Minister speaking with his Qatari counterpart 
Working group on policy of the German-Nigerian Binational Commission meets at the Federal Foreign Office 
New measures in the area of refugees and migration 
“We must stick together in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS!” the Foreign Minister said. 
Qatar is part of this Coalition. 
The example of ISIS clearly demonstrates what great power religions have. 
The fight against terrorism and radicalisation, the EU-Africa Summit in autumn of 2017, United Nations reform and the human rights situation were on the agenda of the high-level working group. 
Stabilising the Lake Chad region 
We are therefore well advised to recall Lessing’s Ring Parable, which teaches us what great peacemaking potential religions have. 
The act must be investigated rapidly, urgently and diligently, using rule-of-law means. 
The two Foreign Ministers did not, however, meet to discuss inter-religious conflict. 
In view of the present-day problems faced by societies, the play is as relevant today as it was several centuries ago. 
“that now is the time for diplomacy”. Germany will work together with its European partners to ensure that the conflict does not escalate any further, so that everyone can concentrate on fighting the actual enemy – the ISIS terrorists. 
Religion becomes a fig leaf when it is falsely used by those fighting in political and economic conflicts. 
The Foreign Minister of Qatar visits a highly symbolic location in rural Lower Saxony 
On Friday, 9 June, Sigmar Gabriel met with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani at Herzog August Library in the town of Wolfenbüttel 
More than two hundred years ago, in the home region of the German Foreign Minister, a magnificent building was erected that emphasises what the religions have in common, rather than how they differ. 
The play Nathan the Wise by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, which contains the Ring Parable, is a fundamental text of the Enlightenment. 
It is seen as making the case for humanity-focused and tolerant monotheistic religions. 
Focusing on de-escalation and on fighting the common enemy 
Gabriel went on to say that not only do blockades have severe consequences, but breaking off diplomatic ties leads to disastrous results. The First World War stands as a reminder of this, and in 2018 we will be commemorating that it ended 100 years ago. 
With this in mind, Gabriel is convinced 
The power of religions 
High-ranking representatives from the World Bank, the EU, UN, G7 countries and the countries of the Lake Chad region will meet in Berlin in September in order to discuss measures to achieve greater stability and to strengthen cooperation among countries in the region.

A particularly important focus was on refugees and migration. 
Moreover, a project seeking to gather biometric data in Nigeria is being launched with the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

Moreover, Germany is offering support in the form of stabilisation measures and assistance for displaced persons. 
The Federal Government is currently supporting the country with, among other things, comprehensive humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons in the northeast of the country. 
The two countries established the German-Nigerian Binational Commission in 2011.

Statement by the German Government on the G20 Africa Summit 
The leading economies want to use a conference being held in Berlin on 12 and 13 June under the German G20 Presidency to create new opportunities for sustainable economic growth, investments and stability in Africa. 
Creating new investment opportunities 
“Africa has a very high profile in Berlin at the moment,” said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited representatives of African countries to the conference, G20 Africa Partnership – Investing in a Common Future, in Berlin on 12 and 13 June. 
I’m therefore pleased that the Institute can now finally get down to work.

Berlin as a symbol of openness 
During the conference, the partners want to explore new investment opportunities in Africa and to agree on how new incentives for more private-sector investments, sustainable investments in public infrastructure and economic participation can be created through employment. 
Initiatives on greater use of information and communications technologies by women and girls are also on the agenda. 
Economic development and population growth in Africa increasingly have a global impact, including on the neighbouring continent of Europe and on Germany. 
This is why the German Government made Africa one of the priorities of its G20 Presidency. 
The German Government is endeavouring to boost political and economic stability in Africa through the G20 Africa Partnership. 
Timea Junghaus was presented as the future director of the Institute. 
It also aims to minimise the causes of forced and illegal migration and to foster Africa’s responsibility for itself. 
Gabriel said this exchange is important. 
more unity, more engagement and most importantly, better cooperation between state and society.” 
Art is to serve as a role model for politics in this case. A concert at the Federal Foreign Office on Monday will symbolise the links between Europe and Africa.

The German Government’s global health policy 
It is especially important to protect and defend this at a time when populism and nationalism are on the rise,” stressed the Minister of State for Europe. 
The Federal Government’s global health strategy paper (“Global Health Policy – Taking Joint Action – Embracing Responsibility”) summarises the focuses of the Federal Government’s global health policy and defines a framework for this policy. 
Berlin symbolises openness, a lively cultural scene and colourful and inclusive societies. 
Health is not only one of the most precious things any individual can have, it is also a prerequisite for social, economic and political development and stability. 
By the same token, the growth in importance of health issues on an international level has led to an increasing number of government, bilateral or multilateral and non-government players, which in turn has led to a fragmentation of the global health architecture and the duplication of activities. 
The German Government wants to ensure the sustainable protection and improvement of public health. 
Cross-border threats to health as well as the effects of climate change clearly illustrate that

Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (13 June): 
Until their cases are reviewed and they have a chance to be rehabilitated, they are in effect prevented from re-entering the labour market in Turkey. 
With their hunger strike, they are expressing the powerlessness felt by many who have been affected. 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the situation in Turkey 
The literature professor Nuriye Gülmen and the teacher Semih Özakça were arrested on 22 May and are currently in the 94th day of a hunger strike. Their action can be seen as a symbolic protest against the dismissal of well over 100,000 Turkish civil servants since a state of emergency was declared on 21 July 2016. 
The dismissals are not subject to judicial review. 
A government commission that was established for this purpose in January has still not taken up its duties – despite statements to the contrary by the Turkish Government. 
Without case reviews, the dismissed have been labelled suspected terrorists and are subject to stigmatisation. Countless former civil servants and their families face financial ruin. 
Against this backdrop, I call on the Turkish Government to give all those dismissed an early review of their cases, based on due process, so that the allegations made against each individual can be carefully examined. 
As a member of the Council of Europe, Turkey has promised to uphold the right to a fair trial. This must also apply to all legal proceedings in the aftermath of the internationally condemned attempted coup.

At the annual meeting of the ICRC Donor Support Group in Bonn the parameters were set for the future work of one of the most important humanitarian agencies. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is one of the key international humanitarian agencies – and an important partner for Germany when it comes to trying to help people in need. 
At the Donor Support Group’s annual meeting in Bonn on 8 and 9 June, Germany looked back over the work done during its chairmanship. 
The work of the ICRC 
The ICRC (based in Geneva) works all over the globe to protect the victims of armed conflicts and coordinates international relief operations. 
Last week marked the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the Protocols of 8 June 1977 additional to the Geneva Convention, which further enhanced the protection of the civilian population in armed conflicts.

Humanitarian assistance is increasingly dominated by protracted crises. 
Relief organisations and donors must adapt to this situation. 
As Chair of the Donor Support Group, Germany made dealing with protracted crises the main focus of its chairmanship. 
It is clear that long-term pledges of support by donors make it possible for aid workers to plan their operations better. 
For many years now, the Federal Foreign Office has therefore been carrying out multiannual humanitarian assistance projects with the ICRC. 
At the same time, local structures have to be strengthened – for aid workers on the ground are the quickest to reach areas where humanitarian assistance is required. 
Many refugees around the world are dependent on humanitarian aid. 
A key approach is to provide assistance in the areas where the refugees come from. 
The ICRC is doing important work there. 
Germany is encouraging and supporting new donors and partners for the ICRC. 
How Germany supports the ICRC 
In 2016 alone, the Federal Foreign Office made available more than 111 million euros for ICRC humanitarian aid projects. 
This year, too, the ICRC will receive more than 100 million euros, mainly in Africa and the Middle East. 
Special attention is being paid to the current hunger crises in Nigeria, Yemen, South Sudan and Somalia – in these countries alone, more than 35 million euros will be used to help people in need. 
Canada will take over from Germany next month. 
As a member of the ICRC Donor Support Group, Germany will continue to take part in the ICRC’s strategic direction and planning for the future.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel following Ambassador Martin Erdmann’s visit to Deniz Yücel 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (13 June) after Ambassador Martin Erdmann’s visit to Deniz Yücel in prison: 
The Group’s task is to provide a forum in which the ICRC’s major donors can exchange views on how to optimise operations in humanitarian crises. 
Compliance with international humanitarian law is especially important to the ICRC’s work. 
It is good that our Ambassador was able to speak in person with Deniz Yücel today and to find out more about the prison conditions. 
We have noted his requests for better prison conditions. 
Germany took over the – one-year – chairmanship of the ICRC Donor Support Group for the second time in July 2016, the first time having been back in 2000/2001. 
We are continuing to work on this, and I discussed the matter recently with my Turkish counterpart in Ankara. 
That does not change the fact that we, his wife, his newspaper and his colleagues call for a swift and fair trial and want him to be released. 
8th Annual Forum of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region convenes at the Federal Foreign Office 
It was opened by Foreign Minister Gabriel together with Nobel Peace Laureate Martti Ahtisaari and Sara Mazur, Vice President of Ericsson. 
Some 800 participants from the worlds of politics, business, science and culture are discussing issues relating to the Baltic Sea. 
The event was organised by the Federal Foreign Office in close collaboration with the Baltic Sea Commission and the European Commission. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opened the Forum together with Nobel Peace Laureate Martti Ahtisaari and Sara Mazur, Vice President of Ericsson. 
A role model for other regions 
“Cooperation in a spirit of trust does not emerge of its own accord,” Foreign Minister Gabriel said at the start of the conference. 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and Germany. 
As Gabriel stressed, today’s intensive cooperation between the countries serves as a model for other world regions. 
Gabriel felt that close cooperation with Russia was still possible in the Baltic Sea framework, and that this constituted an important step towards improving the situation. 
Infrastructure and marine protection 
I am relieved to hear that Deniz Yücel said he is well. 
Well-known firms such as Skype and Spotify began as start-ups in the Baltic Sea states. 
Secondly, the protection of the Baltic Sea itself is on the agenda. 
Gabriel picked out two themes which will be particularly important at this year’s meeting. First was the region’s role as a centre of innovation. 
Huge quantities of nitrogen continue to flow down various rivers into the Baltic Sea. This has a negative impact on marine life. 
Two plenary debates featuring eminent speakers are to provide additional input on transport policy as a motor of regional development and on blue growth – growth of the marine and maritime economy having full regard to environmental protection. 
“A model for other regions”: 
Gabriel felt that this cooperation illustrated what a force for peace the EU could be. 
He described it instead as requiring energy and determination on the part of all those involved. 
In Gabriel’s opinion, all the right elements have successfully come together in the Baltic Sea Region. 
The EU’s neighbours Norway, Belarus and north-western Russia are also involved in the Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. 
Cooperation between Baltic Sea states has a long history. The countries already had close economic links within the Hanseatic League, and political and cultural ties have remained vibrant. 
Gabriel went on to note that the political climate in the Baltic Sea region had deteriorated recently, above all as regards relations with Russia. 
Against this background, it was all the more important to maintain good relations and keep the dialogue going within the region. 
This potential should be built on, for example through the promotion of investments. 
Fish stocks are also declining at ever faster rates. Here, too, the Baltic Sea states should work on joint solutions. 
The conference participants will also debate the expansion of tourism and infrastructure, as well as sustainable business models. 
The larger part of the Baltic Sea coast lies within the EU. Eight EU member states have sea borders on the Baltic: 
The theme of this year’s Forum, connectivity, is thus intended to encapsulate the central idea underpinning cooperation around the Baltic Sea: 
transnational cooperation is essential when it comes to creating a successful region, be it with respect to infrastructure, environmental protection, energy or science. 
A packed programme covering tourism, blue growth and digitalisation 
Together with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as well as the national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the ICRC – founded in 1863 – forms the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. 
For the steadily increasing humanitarian need around the world means that new donors step up their commitment to humanitarian assistance and the ICRC in particular. 
With Germany’s help, the ICRC has ensured that the tents in a refugee camp in Lebanon have been insulated. 
Russia Coordinator Erler on arrests of demonstrators in Russia 
Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Federal Congress on Cultural Policy 
Demonstrations against corruption, which opposition leader Alexei Navalny had called for, were held in Russia on 12 June. 
The fact that more than one thousand peaceful demonstrators were arrested at yesterday’s protests, which opposition politician Alexei Navalny had called for, gives us cause to doubt whether such actions were proportionate. 
A large number of demonstrators were arrested. Navalny was detained prior to the demonstrations. 
Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (13 June) on the detention of more than one thousand demonstrators in Russia: 
This major crackdown by the Russian authorities threatens the freedom of assembly and the freedom of expression, rights which are guaranteed by the Russian constitution and which Russia has committed to complying with internationally. 
These days, internal and external policy are inextricably linked. 
Federal Finance Minister Schäuble signs convention clamping down on tax avoidance 
On 7 June 2017, 67 states including Germany signed the Multilateral Instrument (MLI), a historic step towards combating legal tax avoidance. 
We will keep a close eye on further developments in Russia and expect that those who have been arrested will be released again without delay. 
considering the many crises we currently face, cross-border cooperation is more important than ever – not only between countries, but particularly also between our societies. 
The Federal Congress on Cultural Policy is jointly organised by the Association for Cultural Policy and the Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb). It is held every two years and is attended by the key actors of Germany’s cultural policy. 
Culture and intercultural dialogue 
Tomorrow (Thursday, 15 June) Foreign Minister Gabriel will attend the Federal Congress on Cultural Policy at the Catholic Academy in Berlin, where he will deliver a keynote speech entitled Crisis, Order, Europe – Germany’s cultural policy and responsibility on the world stage. 
Retreating into our national shells or resorting to self-centred policy would be the completely wrong answer, in view of our increasingly interconnected world. 
Ensuring access to culture and education, and thus enabling participation in a society’s decision-making, is key for giving people access to a brighter future. 
With Germany’s cultural relations and education policy, we are helping people in conflict regions, and we are creating spaces in which culture, science and education are free to develop. 
There will be various panels and fora, at which participants will discuss current cultural and artistic developments in connection with globalisation, as well as their effects on the challenges that cultural policy is facing. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel made the following statement prior to the congress: 
Numerous non-OECD countries were also involved in negotiating the convention within the OECD framework. 
The MLI is designed to simplify and harmonise some 1100 bilateral double taxation agreements, particularly with the aim of reducing tax avoidance by multinational companies and closing loopholes. 
Disputes are to be settled in line with provisions on the resolution of treaty-related disputes. 
The agreement on binding arbitration is intended both to reduce double taxation and to enhance tax certainty. 
We want to step up these efforts, together with our European partners and especially with France. Our endeavours will focus on, among other places, selected locations in Turkey. 
Furthermore, as a country of immigration, we must make sure that we better use the expertise of our cultural intermediaries here at home– for example, when addressing integration-related issues. 
The motto for this year’s Federal Congress is Internal and external cultural policy. 
The G20 remained committed to the relevant results and their implementation, he went on. 
The OECD was providing much-appreciated support, Schäuble added. 
Today’s signing of the convention, said OECD Secretary-General Gurría, showed that the international community was capable of working together to effectively tackle problems or challenges. 
The convention is open for accession by other states. 
In addition to the 67 signatory states, a further nine countries have already announced their intention to join. 
Germany initially wants to apply the regulations contained in the MLI to around 30 double taxation agreements. 
The MLI has yet to be ratified, so the earliest date when it can be applied is likely to be 2019. 
The implementation of the BEPS Project and of the MLI, he said, was part of the G20’s comprehensive goal of attaining improved global governance. 
The MLI is a convention based on the 15 Actions adopted by the G20 in 2015 to combat Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) in the field of taxation. 
Federal Finance Minister Schäuble praised the MLI as a major element in the implementation of the BEPS Project, also within the framework of the German G20 Presidency. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the adoption of the German Government’s guidelines on crisis prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding 
The guidelines express our commitment to an interconnected approach. 
We want to invest more in prevention, as the use of military force remains the last resort. 
Channels of communication can be kept open in conflict situations through mediation and diplomatic endeavours. 
thus achieving a key aim of the coalition agreement. 
The German Government adopted guidelines on crisis prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding today, 
The focus is on the guiding principle of peace in all our endeavours. 
We now have a strategic document for the German Government’s actions. 
Our long-term aim is to help establish structures that guarantee security for all, facilitate a peaceful balancing of political interests and provide fundamental state services so that lasting peace can spread. 
The adoption of the guidelines by no means spells the end of the underlying dialogue process. 
when it comes to putting these guidelines into practice, we will certainly need a lively discussion with the public. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (14 June) on the adoption of the German Government’s guidelines on crisis prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding on 14 June 2017: 
All instruments, whether they involve civilian projects, police training or, in extreme cases, deployment of our armed forces, the Bundeswehr, serve to support a political strategy. 
We will therefore present the guidelines in parliament, the German Bundestag, in the coming weeks and discuss with the Advisory Board for Civilian Crisis Prevention how the dialogue can be continued.

Launched in 2006, the Universal Periodic Review is a process in which all United Nations Member States report at regular intervals on the implementation of their human rights obligations. 
The process is based on the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the human rights agreements ratified by the state in question and voluntary commitments made by the state. 
Prior to the process, a wide-ranging interministerial consultation process takes place, resulting in a report that is discussed with other UN Member States in the Human Rights Council. 
Civil society and national human rights institutions (in Germany, the German Institute for Human Rights) are able to submit their own reports to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR). 
The German Government is also inviting members of the public to a public consultation, 
Information on the findings of the previous reviews can be found on the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the German Institute for Human Rights. 
Germany underwent this process in 2009 and 2013 and will report again to the Human Rights Council in 2018. 
If you are interested in attending the event, please register by email (menschenrechtsbeauftragte@diplo.de). Registration closes at midday on 22 June. 
The Federal Foreign Office is coordinating the necessary preparations. 
In 2018, Germany will undergo another Universal Periodic Review of the implementation of its human rights obligations.

It is in the common interest of the EU and the US to take resolute and unified action with a view to resolving the conflict in Ukraine. 
This is about the competitiveness of our energy-intensive industries, and about thousands of jobs. 
Europe’s energy supply network is Europe’s affair, not that of the United States of America! 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Austrian Federal Chancellor Kern on the imposition of Russia sanctions by the United States Senate 
Austrian Federal Chancellor Christian Kern (SPÖ) and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) commented as follows today (15 June) on the approval by the United States Senate of legislation regarding sanctions against Russia: 
Since 2014, Europe and the United States have taken closely coordinated action, as partners, in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and to Russian actions in eastern Ukraine. 
That was the correct and necessary reaction to behaviour on behalf of Russia that not only jeopardises peace and security in Europe, but also, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, was a flagrant infringement of our principles of inviolable national borders in Europe. 
The draft bill of the US is surprisingly candid about what is actually at stake, namely selling American liquefied natural gas and ending the supply of Russian natural gas to the European market. 
Political sanctions should not in any way be tied to economic interests. 
Foreign policy interests must in no way be linked to economic interests! 
There is still enough time, and opportunity, to prevent this! 
We cannot, however, accept the threat of illegal extraterritorial sanctions being imposed on European companies that are participating in efforts to expand Europe’s energy supply network! 
We decide who supplies us with energy, and how they do it, and we do so based on transparency and on free market principles. 
It would not only be highly regrettable, but would also diminish the effectiveness of our stance on the conflict in Ukraine, if we were to no longer take joint action, and if completely separate interests were to prevail, such as the US’s economic pursuits in the field of gas exports. 
Threatening to impose penalties on companies in Germany, Austria and other European countries with regard to their business in the United States if they participate in, or fund, natural gas projects involving Russia, such as Nord Stream 2, impacts European-American relations in a new and very negative way. 
We therefore strongly support the efforts of the US Department of State to amend this draft bill. 
The bill aims to protect US jobs in the natural gas and petroleum industries. 
The new guidelines on crisis prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding were adopted by the Cabinet on 14 June 2017. 
They are the result of a broad-based discussion in society with over 1800 participants at 27 events entitled 
AM spricht mit … Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel talking to German police officers of the MINUSMA-UNPOL training mission at the National Police School in Bamako, the capital of Mali, on 7 April 2017 
You can find more than 100 interesting articles on the blog documenting this process. 
This goes to show that 
These important contributions to the debate have been taken into consideration in the interministerial coordination on the guidelines overseen by the Federal Foreign Office. 
Chancellor Merkel already outlined the history of the Order this afternoon. 
175 years ago – on 31 May 1842 – King Friedrich Wilhelm IV founded the civil class of the Order, the Order Pour le Mérite for Services to Science and the Arts. 
Values-based national interests – internationally agreed priorities 
Hilfslieferung … Aid delivery by the International Red Cross at the Lebanese refugee camp Nahr al-Bared 
The primacy of politics and prioritising prevention are our guiding principles. 
While the guidelines are a national document, 
the New Deal agreed in 2011 among international donors together with fragile states is an important point of reference alongside the 2030 Agenda. 
Alexander von Humboldt concluded that “everything is interrelated” back in the mid-1800s. Today – more than 200 years later – this relatively simple but infinitely important insight has unfortunately been forgotten by many, including certain influential state leaders. 
In keeping with this, Germany’s policy is guided by five priorities: 
Strengthening legitimate political structures 
Creating a secure environment 
Promoting the rule of law 
Creating economic foundations and employment opportunities 
Promoting effective governance and transparent public finances 
Identifying crises at an earlier stage 
The Ministries will improve the coordination of the instruments of early crisis detection in order to be better prepared for possible escalations. 
The Federal Government is reviewing and continuing to develop the mechanisms of interministerial coordination of crises and conflicts. 
The Advisory Board for Civilian Crisis Prevention is an advisory body consisting of experts from the German Bundestag, civil society and academia.

Peace Lab 
Alexander von Humboldt said: 
The guidelines now form the strategic basis for the Federal Government’s efforts to prevent crisises, manage conflicts and promote peace. 
The objective is to arrive at long-term peace settlements. 
This is also in keeping with the spirit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to which Germany is committed. 
Protecting people from infringements of their rights and fundamental freedoms is always the main priority of Germany’s efforts. 
This year we will mark the 250th birthday of his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, the great educational reformer. 
These guidelines are the catalyst for an adjustment of structures and procedures at Federal Government level. 
“The most dangerous world view is the world view of those who have never viewed the world.” That reads like a comment on the state of the world today. 
He, too, attached importance to each person’s individuality and looked beyond that to the bigger picture. 
A greater role for civil society – strengthening the Advisory Board for Civilian Crisis Prevention 
The Federal Government will submit pertinent initiatives to the Advisory Board in good time in the future. 
The true purpose of man, Wilhelm believed, was, I quote, “the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent whole. 
The body receives funding for drafting its own reports and holding events.

there is broad-based interest in society regarding the question as to how Germany can become involved around the world in order to prevent or resolve armed conflict with civilian means. 
As a result of our research, we have vanquished some diseases and made others manageable, diseases that previously claimed millions of lives. 
But wherever unreason and irrationality win the upper hand, where – for example – the efficacy of vaccinations is impugned, where scientific findings about man-made climate change are denied, people become immune to facts and realities. 
This really cannot be the legacy of the Enlightenment. 
They start propounding world views 
that explain the world as they would like it to be. 
When academic freedom is at stake, it is the researchers, the teachers, the scientists themselves who are called upon to defend this freedom and to fight half truths and “alternative facts”. 
Communicating the complexities of science in a comprehensible manner, whilst retaining the necessary accuracy, is a difficult but probably crucial task. 
However, I do wish that these voices would make an even greater effort to get through to those sections of the public that are not so academically grounded. 
in a turbulent world our need for scientific expertise and a clear focus is greater than ever, if we are to keep a cool head and act rationally. 
we are now in a position, at least in principle, to solve problems together, as the international community. 
I can tell you a thing or two about it from where I stand! 
But if we are concerned about echo chambers in the social media, if we criticise them – the echo chambers – then it has to be our common interest to ensure that science, and likewise politics, does not end up locked away in an ivory tower or enclosed in an echo chamber either. 
We need free discourse, cultural receptiveness, and of course academic cooperation across national borders, of the kind that you pursue amongst yourselves. 
Crisis, order, Europe – speech by Foreign Minister Gabriel at the 9th Federal Congress on Cultural Policy 
“Internal and external cultural policy” is the title you have chosen for your Congress. 
And you have tasked me with talking about this. 
I am glad, ladies and gentlemen, that you are here. 
Let me congratulate the newest members of the Order once again. 
that we have known this for a long time. 
I hope we all learn something from our conversations tonight, and I wish us all a pleasurable evening – that is allowed, after all! 
It’s going to be most uncomfortable. 
After all, we in Europe are used to having our own unique character. 
The Americans have staked their claim to an exceptionalism that goes thus: 
but we don’t want to have anything to do with the world. 
But we don’t really want to be a part of it.” 
65 years ago, the Order was “augmented once again” at the behest of President Theodor Heuss, it was “renewed”, as it was said, after it had – for reasons known to us all – shrunk to just a few members under the Nazi dictatorship. 
Because, for example, there are sometimes situations in which, before you can get long-term changes under way, you have to ensure that people are no longer murdered. 
Those are difficult consequences because we preferred to keep such things at arm’s length in the past. 
These developments are reaching us in Germany and Europe in a very real way in the form of refugees. 
And we are feeling the shock waves up close here as a result. 
Asia is growing. 
Africa is growing. 
Latin America is growing. 
We are shrinking. 
Even a strong Germany won’t stand a chance of being heard. 
Let the summer holidays begin! 
The EU has scrapped roaming charges 
New EU legislation that will please Europe’s consumers is entering into force just in time for the summer holiday season: 
from 15 June, roaming charges are to be scrapped. 
So, wherever you’re travelling in the EU, you can call, text and browse the internet on your mobile for the same price as at home.

The end of roaming charges is a true European success story.”

We agree wholeheartedly! 
While we’re happily chatting on our mobiles on the beach this summer, we’ll remember 
that the huge advantages when travelling within the EU are major successes and tangible results of the process of European integration. 
Without them, it would be impossible to explore Europe’s cultural and scenic diversity so easily or to travel and learn beyond our national borders. 
While we’re on the subject of holidays and mobile phones: 
don’t forget our “Sicher Reisen” app! It gives you information and tips to help you travel safely. 
Pursuant to section 7 of the Nationality Act, repatriates returning to Germany in or after 1993 automatically acquire German nationality 
upon receipt of the papers issued under section 15 of the Federal Expellees Act after they arrive 
in Germany. 
all of this gives rise to uncertainties, to perceived and real material uncertainties among a part of the people here about their life prospects, jobs and security. 
Cultural uncertainties also emerge. 
In all of this, there is no doubt that we are undergoing a phase of major processes of change. 
And it is becoming clear that 
A loss of power, a loss of control and orientation, a loss of or endangered social identity – anxiety has many facets and dimensions. 
The temptation all around the world, also here in Germany, to seek to make up for the loss of economic and political influence, or indeed sovereignty, on the part of individuals is therefore all the greater. 
However, the answers that are posited are more tempting. 
A chimera that appears to make a good impression on many people. 
Along the lines of 
Auch in Rom … No roaming charges in Rome either: 
These achievements also include the abolition of internal borders within the Schengen area, the creation of the euro area, with no need to change currency, and easy bank transfers, for paying hotel bills, for instance. 
And, above all, it is a cultural challenge as this is about nothing less than a fundamentally different understanding of our coexistence than has been the case to date. 
A new authoritarianism is bent on isolation and exclusion and not on partnership. 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at a dinner for members of the Order Pour le Mérite in Schloss Bellevue on 11 June 2017 
It is really a special pleasure for me tonight to welcome you, the members of this celebrated Order, to Schloss Bellevue for what is at least for me the first time as President. Let me extend a very warm welcome to each of you! 
For that reason, another sentiment expressed by Alexander von Humboldt, which I liked to quote in my days as Foreign Minister when warning of treating with other states on the basis of resentments and prejudices, was perhaps just as foresighted. 
And we especially really should be, we who live in a world whose secrets have almost all been unveiled – only to reveal new, unexplored territory. 
Science is based on a thirst for knowledge, on scepticism, on argument, on verifiability - in brief on the power of reason. 
However, it is a fact that principles and values which have their roots in the Enlightenment, which were recognised and accepted, which were prerequisites for civilisation and the advent of democracy, liberty and the rule of law in modern Western societies, are now being challenged, are at risk of being sucked into the maelstrom of 140-character communication, in which the distinction between fact and lies, a distinction of existential importance for any democracy, risks being bulldozed. 
But equally only through joint action by the international community. 
And it is for precisely this reason that it is an unsound and, I would add, a harmful message when the most important country in the world wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement – the greatest success story of global cooperation this decade. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the forest fires in Portugal 
I am deeply shocked by the terrible news from Portugal. 
It is certainly not concerned about the fact that many people gathering together has a far greater cultural value than the sum of individual interests. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 June) on the devastating forest fires in the Leiria region in Portugal: 
We have seen horrifying images of besieged villages and people killed in the inferno while trying to escape in their cars. 
This is the worst fire disaster in Portugal for many decades. 
First thing this morning, I expressed our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa, and offered him our help and support should it be required. 
International scientists work together at SESAME

The focus is not only on acute crisis management, but also on effective prevention, to keep crises from arising in the first place and to ensure that they do not break out again once they have ended. 
Jordan is attempting to be a mediator in the region 
It is no coincidence that SESAME is located in Jordan. 
By donating the BESSY I particle accelerator, Germany has substantially contributed to the SESAME project, where it now enjoys observer status.

From a technical point of view, it is the first synchrotron in the region. 
and give Germany’s crisis management a clear guiding principle that focuses on prevention. 
The guidelines look at all instruments of German foreign, security and development policy which the Government can use to try to prevent crises and conflicts from erupting at all. 
Civil society played a key role in drawing up the new guidelines. 
SESAME opened its doors in Amman on 16 May. It is the largest research centre in the Middle East and stands for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East. 
From a technical point of view, it is the first synchotron in the region, and it can be described as a particle accelerator. 
Politically, however, it is almost a miracle. 
Jordan pursues a foreign policy of conciliation with its neighbours and tries to help achieve peace in the region. 
The new research centre seeks to enable cross-border cooperation and to prevent highly qualified scientists from leaving the Middle East because it lacks the respective technical infrastructure. 
Both researchers have served as Directors General of the CERN accelerator in Europe (Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire).

The Federal Foreign Office’s crisis-prevention activities are part of a precautionary foreign policy that is based on simple logic: 
“It is much better to invest in stability and peace in a precautionary, targeted and flexible way than to be forced to intervene either late, or too late.” 
Some key aspects of this precautionary work are:

I believe that we must, on the one hand, face up to the real erosion of the importance of the nation state while at the same time doing our utmost to ensure that people do not fall into the trap of new nationalist narratives and promises with which populists on the left, but above all on the right, seek to turn these new uncertainties to their advantage. 
After all, 2018 marks the centenary of the end of the First World War. 
There will be plenty of narratives on this in Europe. 
but that there is also a common Europe narrative in the mix. 
We must therefore mention the new “internal and external” in the same breath. 
We must ponder these dimensions together and respond with determination and conviction – 
we must get a second Enlightenment off the ground! 
by making it much clearer than to date that the nation state of the 19th century is certainly not, nor can it be, the appropriate form of common thought, empathy and decision-making.

Development cooperation is an important aspect of relations with Latin America. 
Latin America’s economic and political significance throughout the world has grown considerably in the last few decades. 
With all due respect for the debate on cultural identity – 
And that is the first twenty articles of the Basic Law. 
I know of no cultural identity that is better than the Basic Law. 
With this in mind, I have – as defined by Jürgen Habermas – always considered myself to be a constitutional patriot. 
Why am I emphasising this?

Because foreign policy and cultural relations policy can help us to master this common challenge.

If the region is to achieve lasting success in world markets and in the international arena, it also needs to strengthen social security systems and promote dialogue between all sections of society. 
For over 50 years Germany has been cooperating with the countries of Latin America to support the region’s development. 
And sometimes we must be especially patient 
as in the example of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation’s intention to exhibit the collection of the Tehran Museum for Contemporary Art here in Berlin. 
We must strengthen the cultural fabric that establishes connections especially where the political dialogue is difficult. 
Latin America is a continent of social disparities and inequality. 
Entire population segments remain excluded from the development process. 
In several countries, a lack of job prospects for young people and organised crime create a breeding ground for violence. 
Many Latin American states are already implementing their own development measures in third countries. 
In the battle of the narratives, we must make our country’s story accessible, communicate it and make it a common narrative. 
Protection and sustainable use of natural resources 
I have therefore asked the Goethe-Institut to summarise its experiences garnered abroad and to enter into a dialogue with the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany as soon as possible. 
And I would like to mention another aspect with respect to the Luther year. 
The Latin American continent is home to the largest tropical rain forest area in the world. 
How strongly religion – not belief 
– wanted to keep them apart. 
No, religion is not necessarily a social adhesive as my Cabinet colleague Thomas de Maizière wrote recently. 
Religion certainly has the capacity to be that. In the best case, it is indeed that, but not necessarily. 
But it is called upon to rise to this challenge. 
Religious communities certainly have a responsibility for peaceful coexistence among people nowadays. 
It was with this in mind that we invited around 100 representatives of religious communities to the Federal Foreign Office a few weeks ago. 
And to learn from the religious leaders’ experiences, 
as well as to come together to prevent religious experiences and narratives from being abused in order to create new lines of conflict. 
The “Bild-Zeitung” wrote about how terrible our choice of invitees was. 
We will need to talk with people who aren’t nice, 
who are complicated and difficult. 
However, it’s just election time as you know. 
I firmly believe that our experience out there in the world can only be useful also here in Germany. 
And, against this backdrop, allow me to remark on a cultural policy debate that appears to be making more of an impact on this city right now than a number of other things. 
While protection of the rainforests plays an important role in Brazil, Germany is supporting the creation of a biological corridor in Central America running from Mexico to Panama.

Promoting peaceful societies, strengthening development-oriented governance, fostering cooperation with the private sector and vocational training 
In the recent past, it has usually been possible to use international mechanisms to resolve conflicts between states. 
German development policy supports these peace processes and is doing its part to encourage reconciliation and reparation. 
German development policy has supported this not least through programmes fostering state and tax reform, decentralisation and public participation. 
Visitor Centre at the Federal Foreign Office 
We look forward to seeing you in the Federal Foreign Office Visitor Centre! 
The Visitor Centre offers talks on the Federal Foreign Office’s tasks and how it works. 
Cooperation between development policy players and the private sector also plays a key role. 
Many of the Latin American states are particularly suitable for public-private partnership approaches (PPP).

Of course, the dome and cross were an anti-democratic symbol of the divine right of the rulers of the German Empire. 
Germany is promoting bilateral development measures in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. 
In order to be able to play an even earlier, more decisive and more effective role in preventing and overcoming crises, the Federal Government, with the Federal Foreign Office having the lead responsibility, has drawn up a new basic document, the policy guidelines on “Preventing crises, managing conflicts, building peace” [LINK Unterseite]. 
These new policy guidelines replace the 2004 Action Plan “Civilian Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Post-Conflict Peace-Building”. 
They add an equally important, primarily civilian pillar of German peace and security policy to the White Paper on German Security Policy and the Future of the Bundeswehr of 2016 
In a consultation process lasting several months, the German Government discussed the concrete contents with the public at various events under the title “PeaceLab2016 – A Fresh Look at Crisis Prevention”. 
Peace mediation and post‑conflict peacebuilding 
The Subcommittee was constituted in March 2010 and held its first regular session on 19 April 2010. 
Now that the new policy guidelines have been adopted, it will be monitoring the implementation of the guidelines and the follow‑up processes they stipulate. 
This 19‑strong Advisory Board, which advises and supports the Interministerial Steering Group, serves this very purpose. 
ZIF is organised as a non‑profit company with the Federal Republic of Germany, represented by the Federal Foreign Office, as its sole shareholder. 
Building on the first United Nations peace operations of the late 1940s – the ‘blue helmet’ missions – they have developed into complex multidimensional undertakings. 
Alongside the United Nations, international peace operations are now also conducted by regional organisations like NATO, the EU, ECOWAS (West Africa) and the OSCE. 
UN peacekeeping missions 
Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter gives the Organisation, through the support of its member states, numerous instruments for the peaceful settlement of disputes. 
One important UN instrument for conflict management is the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). 
The PBC gathers around one table the international and national actors involved in a post-conflict situation, supporting them during the reconstruction process, promoting a coherent strategy for post-conflict peacebuilding, and helping to mobilise resources. 
Germany is a PBC founding member and makes voluntary contributions to the UN Peacebuilding Fund for relevant initiatives. 
In addition to the UN, many other organisations are active in the domains of crisis prevention, conflict management and post‑conflict peacebuilding. 
Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE) 
It works with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay and the Caribbean on development policy activities with a regional or thematic focus. 
Cooperation with Latin America, a central partner in efforts to protect global public goods, focuses on environmental and climate protection. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development is building on triangular cooperation as a link between development cooperation and South-South cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean to make it an established German development cooperation tool. 
In the area of climate protection, Germany is helping its cooperation partners to prepare the ground for a secure and clean energy supply: 
by improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energies and supporting sustainable forest management. 
In view of the historical references, I find it astonishing that the cross has triggered this row and not the political attitude of the Prussian-Wilhelmine age for which this palace also stands. 
In Central America and the Andes region, Germany is also helping countries to tap the potential of geothermal energy more effectively. 
In an international comparison, Latin America is now regarded as a peaceful region. 
For example, it has promoted measures to prevent violence among young people within the context of the Central American security strategy. 
Although most of the countries of Latin America have democratic systems of government, they still face the challenge of enabling all social groups to participate equally in the development of their countries. 
But I’ll admit that I’m just a Social Democrat, and sometimes we react somewhat awkwardly to attempts to glorify Prussia and Bismarck. 
It has also bolstered regional institutions and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the right of access to justice and human rights. 
The entire resistance against the bourgeois revolution and this epoch’s understanding of itself were informed by this. 
The continent is also home to the largest tropical rain forest area in the world and over 40 percent of global biodiversity. 
A fiscal and tax policy aimed at narrowing the gap between haves and have‑nots can do much to foster social cohesion and strengthen democracy. 
Almost 30 percent of the population – around 167 million people – are classed as poor.

As a global “lung”, it binds on average 660 tons of CO2 per hectare, making a vital contribution to combating climate change. 
Latin America also has approximately 30,000 kilometres of marine coast with more than 13,000 species of animals and plants. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, in cooperation with indigenous organisations, is promoting efforts to strengthen sustainable value‑added chains in forest management. 
In recent years, for example, it has been possible, with German assistance, to increase the power generation capacity of renewable energies in Latin America by more than 1000 megawatts. 
As a cross‑cutting issue, vocational training is also to be specifically targeted as an area for promotion. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on World Refugee Day 
“Violent conflicts, persecution and massive human rights violations are forcing more and more people around the world to flee their homes. 
Gaining humanitarian access to those affected is a central challenge for aid organisations. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is one of our most important partners for humanitarian assistance. 
Staying on course in turbulent times: 
European Union flags 
Together, we work to help refugees who are in distress. 
We take this task very seriously. 
Last year, the Federal Foreign Office made available some 307 million euros to the UNHCR – a record amount. 
Meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, the Ministers agreed that the sanctions would now remain in force until June 2018. 
Several million people have been living there as refugees and internally displaced persons for more than six years. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel plainly stated that a relaxation of the restrictions would only be on the table once the terms of the Minsk peace agreement were implemented. 
This is also about opening up long-term prospects for refugees, so that they can shape their own futures. 
Germany is endeavouring to enforce and monitor the ceasefire through its participation in a negotiating group comprising Germany, Russia, Ukraine and France. 
Punitive measures for a violation of international law 
For this purpose, we have together with the German Academic Exchange Service set up a scholarship fund for Syrian students in Germany. 
One thing remains clear: 
Please note that the talks are provided on weekdays only, 
It is not possible to book any earlier than that, because the Visitor Centre may be needed for conferences. 
Tours of the ministry are available during the Federal Government’s Open Day only. 
Contact form 
The sanctions restrict the import and export of goods to and from the peninsula, and also limit investment and the acquisition of real estate. 
The UNHCR is the guardian of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the most important international document on the protection of refugees. 
The restrictive measures are also designed to make sure that the administration instituted following Russia’s occupation of Crimea does not profit from tourism revenue. 
For example, European cruise ships are not allowed to call at any ports on the peninsula. 
Russian and Ukrainian flags 
The world has shrunk. 
Political, economic and social developments do not stop at national borders. 
In a parallel effort, the Federal Foreign Office has joined forces with people and partners involved in Germany’s cultural relations and education policy to significantly increase cultural work in crisis-hit regions. 
Federal Foreign Office 
In 2017 alone, a total of 25.3 million euros are being provided to support such work with and for refugees. 
On the occasion of World Refugee Day, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (20 June): 
In his opening address, Gernot Erler, Special Representative of the Federal Government for the OSCE, underscored the importance of exchange in our globalised world. 
Conference participants 
They are often prevented from returning for many years without risking life and limb. This means they depend on reliable protection by the international community. 
Many require humanitarian aid to provide for themselves and their families, and to live a dignified and secure life. 
Our efforts mainly focus on ensuring that refugees get the protection they require, for example in Syria and in the neighbouring countries that are affected by the crisis. 
That is also why, for many years, we have been supporting refugees through the Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative of the UNHCR, by enabling them to pursue university-level studies in their countries of asylum. 
Germany cannot successfully tackle these challenges by itself. 
No lifting of sanctions without progress in the Minsk peace process 
Gabriel stressed that the international community had to speak with a single voice wherever possible to ensure that severe violations of international law, such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea, did not go unchallenged. 
“As long as that is not the case, things will remain very, very difficult,” Gabriel said. 
This makes Germany one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid. In 2016, Federal Foreign Office spending for this purpose amounted to approximately 1.3 billion euros. 
Gabriel warned that sanctions should not be abused to further one’s own economic interests. 
and hoped that his more moderate position would prevail. 
You probably expected the Foreign Minister to focus on the “external” part of this title, that is to say the foreign policy dimension of cultural policy. 
However, I must disappoint you from the very first sentences of my speech. 
I believe that the division between internal and external, the division between what is happening here in Germany and what is going on out there in the world, is outdated and 
And don’t think for one moment that the disintegration of the internal and the external will be comfortable. 
“we know what is right and we will bring this to everyone else in the world, occasionally also with the means of military intervention.” 
We have trodden the opposite path, namely 
“we know how it’s done, 
The Americans are welcome to handle what’s going on out there – if something goes wrong, then we’ll have someone to blame. 
Those who fuse the internal and the external are given responsibility for the external. 
That’s sometimes particularly uncomfortable. 
And, at the same time, these experiences are intermingling with parallel processes of economic and social change in our own society and throughout the world. 
And if our children intend to continue to have a voice in the world, then it must be a European one – 
and not a national one. 
The focus here is not on clubbing together in order to win back the sovereignty that you no longer have when you stand alone. 
Europe doesn’t represent a loss of sovereignty, but rather helps to recoup the sovereignty that you would no longer have as a nation state. 
“if we have less of a say, then fewer people should say or decide anything at all”. 
The conference offered OSCE representatives the chance to discuss with colleagues from Afghanistan, Australia, Japan, Korea and Thailand how Asia and the OSCE can intensify their cooperation in light of joint challenges and opportunities. 
“To better meet these challenges, regional security organisations such as the OSCE must look beyond their own area of responsibility and forge partnerships with other regional organisations and countries that have a stake in our security.” 
Common challenges, common opportunities 
Coexistence with our neighbours in the world and, of course, in our own country. 
Welcome by State Secretary Walter Lindner Federal Foreign Office 
This point was brought home a few weeks ago in an essay by the US President’s Security Advisor. 
“America first does not mean America only”, a wholly changed world view is posited in which the international community no longer constitutes a common forum with regulated relations, but is an arena or battleground. 
States, associations, non-governmental organisations and culture are all part of this arena. 
It is not the strength of the law that prevails here, but rather the law of the strong. 
That is pretty much the opposite of the idea of the West, which has never been a geographical notion, but a universal and cultural concept. 
This concept is focused on the benefits that emerge when we interact with each other in the context of legally, politically and economically regulated and reliable relations that are based on freedom, democracy and mutual respect, as well as on a desire for peace and cultural exchange. 
Coexisting in an international community, a common home – 
and not in a battle arena. 
You can see therefore that this isn’t a question of the internal and external, but of our conception of coexistence both within and without. 
Or, as Willy Brandt once put it, 
The new authoritarianism is bent on the opposite – 
The first day of the conference, which is entitled “Common challenges and common opportunities”, focused on issues such as confidence-building measures and shaping economic cooperation. 
on superiority and arrogance instead of dialogue, exchanges and open communication. 
namely those who are not on the side of the strong in the arena. 
We sense that, particularly here in Europe, such new nationalist simplifications, which enjoy considerable electoral success, are being held up as the solution to our complex social problems. 
Such populists are bandying slogans about that would have us believe that individual states can recoup their lost glory by cutting themselves off from an interlinked Europe and a globalised world. 
What bearing do these findings have on our cultural policy? 
We must take care to ensure that these aren’t all nationalist ones, 
And that mention is made of something that, unfortunately only after another world war, led to nationalist narratives being held in check in Europe. 
On the second day (20 June), the conference delegates will be discussing what the OSCE and its Asian partners can do to implement the global Sustainable Development Goals. 
The OSCE in the focus of German foreign policy 
It is a good opportunity to respond to such an occasion with the instruments of cultural policy. 
Our democratic culture, the entire democratic culture of the West, which is certainly not a geographical construct, but rather a foundation of shared values, is based on this very concept of Enlightenment. 
Find out more What is the OSCE? 
Of course, we know that people have different fortunes and skills and varying economic, social or cultural backgrounds. 
But we want to think of each other as equals. 
The clarity and potency of the first twenty articles of our Basic Law are founded on these paradoxes. 
we do have one. 
These articles comprise everything that you need to know in order to lead a civilised life and to deal with others in a civilised way. 
That’s not always easy, and not always stress-free. 
These talks last between 60 and 90 minutes and are free of charge. 
To book a talk, your group must include a minimum of 20 people. 
School groups from the 11th grade onwards can register. 
We are supporting this project and will continue to work on this. 
Of course, there is another key task for the coming years here in Germany that is particularly important to me and where the synergy of the internal and external must prove its worth far more intensively and urgently. 
How can we teach the Shoah in school classes in which 60 to 80 percent of the children grow up with very different narratives told around their families’ kitchen tables and in their friendship groups? 
We need the experiences of cultural bridge-builders more than ever here. 
Even now that Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2016 is over, the issues and goals of the OSCE are still on the agenda of German foreign policy. 
Some of us in this room may perhaps remember how difficult it was, as recently as in my childhood, for a Catholic girl to fall in love with a Protestant boy. 
And religious communities are doing this on a large scale especially here in Germany. 
Making the most of common opportunities: 
If there were only nice people in the world, then we wouldn’t need to invite them. 
OSCE and Asian partners convene at the Federal Foreign Office 
I must admit that the question as to whether it is appropriate to afix a cross on the dome of the newly constructed façade of the Prussian Stadtschloss appears a little strange to me. 
On Monday and Tuesday (19 and 20 June), the OSCE and its partners are gathering for an Asian Conference at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Fostering exchange platforms in order to be able to respond to global challenges: 
I say this with all seriousness because I have made the acquaintance of Christians in this country who are refreshingly unorthodox and culturally open. 
It is therefore all the more important to foster exchange platforms in order to be able to deal with global challenges. 
Gernot Erler… 
did anyone actually ask themselves beforehand whose façade they are reconstructing? 
Konferenzteilnehmer… 
Begrüßung durch StS Lindner … 
After all, if you choose to iconocise a Prussian-Wilhelmine façade, something that you can reject out of hand for good reasons, then you have to know what you are doing. 
Of course, architectural historians might wish to point out that the façade dates from the Baroque. However, the reconstruction of this façade does not, politically speaking, stand for the Baroque period, but for the Prussian-Wilhemine era. 
The entire Stadtschloss in the heart of Berlin represents this claim to power targeted against the democrats – 
incidentally, also if the Prussian eagle and not the cross had been erected on the roof of the dome. 
Indeed, we have a certain tendency in Germany to glorify the Prussian era. 
We’re big fans of Alter Fritz the music-lover, the miller who successfully sued the King, Sanssouci and quite a few other things besides. 
However, Prussianism also encompasses a military, aggressive drill culture and conservative, nationalist aspirations that facilitated the intellectual and political rise of extremely dangerous ideologies. 
Anyone who reconstructs Prussian façades must also address the Prussian import of the façade. 
And it seems to me that this isn’t something that can be done by making alterations to it, 
which rather looks like an attempt to correct something that you hadn’t thought through beforehand. 
As far as the current discussion surrounding the cross and dome is concerned, we should perhaps take a leaf from the book of the bourgeois revolutionaries, who certainly had their difficulties during the Prussian age. 
Although they were victims of the alliance between the church and authority, they had a relatively relaxed approach to the issue. 
EU Foreign Ministers extend sanctions imposed over annexation of Crimea 
Staying on course ... 
EU Foreign Ministers have extended the sanctions imposed over Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea for a further year. 
The punitive sanctions adopted by the EU directly target Crimea and the administration set up by Russia in the illegally annexed territory. 
Europe and the US united in their stance against Russia 
“It is important for Europe and the US to remain united in their response to Russia,” Gabriel stated. 
A US bill on sanctions against Russia which would affect business interests in the European energy market has met with criticism these past days. 
He noted that US Secretary of State Tillerson had also expressed reservations about the bill, 
Minister of State Roth said: 
This book project is a moving contribution to coming to terms with the crimes committed against European Jews. 
It was therefore right and proper that we increased our support for UNHCR efforts to help people affected by the crisis in Syria by 48 million euros, to a total of 148 million euros. 
We need collaborative international efforts and a more just division of responsibilities, so that the suffering of refugees around the world can be reduced, and to prevent drawn-out refugee crises from even occurring. 
The mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is to protect and assist the world’s more than 65 million refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, stateless persons and returnees. 
And, in the next verse: 
It is for this reason that I believe that a little bit more Republican composure would do us good in this discussion! 
What matters is something completely different, however. 
We must therefore strive to transform the aristocratic Palace, or indeed its façade, into a democratic place. 
And part of this involves granting others in our world access to us and to our culture while reaching out to the world and to our partners’ culture in return. 
That is to say, treating each other as equals. 
There are fragments of what are known as the Turfan mosaics here in the state museums of Berlin, and also in China, India, Russia and the UK. 
They were hammered out of caves along the Silk Road by archaeologists in the 19th century and taken to different places. 
This new volume contains 350 original sources which document Germany’s expansion in the southern Balkans and the existential threat this posed to the Jewish communities there. 
However, the Jewish population of Yugoslavia and Greece was almost entirely annihilated. 
“But whether we build something new/Or just reuse what we have/That does matter/Whether we create something for the world/Or just gawk at the world/That does matter.” 
The event is being organised by the Institute of Contemporary History Munich-Berlin (IfZ) and the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg in collaboration with the Federal Foreign Office and the De Gruyter publishing house. 
Minister of State for Europe Roth to present new publication in a series on the persecution and murder of European Jews from 1933 to 1945 
On Thursday (22 June), Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth will present the 14th volume in the series documenting the persecution and murder of European Jews between 1933 and 1945. 
The publication brings together original texts from various perspectives and is another key building block in the critical exploration of the past and the commemoration of the victims, enabling us to foster reconciliation and assume responsibility for a better future. 
Gernot Erler, Special Representative of the Federal Government for the OSCE, opened the conference. 
“Asia is and remains an important region for our future – a key region for every single OSCE participating State.” 
OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier declared that there was no alternative to finding cooperative and inclusive solutions to the complex security situation: 
This year, Germany is chairing the Contact Group with the Asian Partners for Co-operation and is organising five expert meetings in Vienna in addition to the OSCE Asian Conference. 
but also, through improved and closer collaboration between academia and culture, by making these archives and collections available for our joint work on the issues of the 21st century both at home and abroad. 
This dome is intended to give rise to one thing in particular, 
At the beginning of my speech, I mentioned that we are experiencing upheavals and uncertainties. 
However, we shouldn’t start scrabbling around for new truths at such times. 
It is for this reason that we are establishing branches of the Goethe-Institut abroad and supporting schools and cooperative partnerships between universities and research bodies. 
This is why it is so important to create and protect these spaces, and also to open them up and make them accessible. 
Because mutual understanding for what we have in common can develop in these spaces. 
This is why the Federal Foreign Office is supporting the Philipp Schwartz Initiative for persecuted researchers relocating to Germany, especially those from Turkey. 
I am therefore delighted that the Deutscher Bühnenverein intends to take the Philipp Schwartz Initiative as an example for establishing its own programme to support “artists at risk”. 
You have our full support for these efforts! 
And I’m not concerned about the democratic context here. 
Translated into English, it goes like this: “Whether we are weighed down by crosses on our fronts or bear them on our backs, that doesn’t matter.” 
However, I would like to use one example to illustrate how we as the Federal Foreign Office can do more to help here in the future. 
It is incumbent on us to express an interest in its cultural and historical dimension. 
In what we are calling a “Virtual Dome”, we intend to create a new form of unity in a virtual space, 
namely access, critical engagement and a new sense of unity both through and within this forum. 
And if this project is a success, then it could become a starting point for how we, far beyond the Humboldt-Forum, can alter the work of museums between the domestic and foreign realms. 
Martin Roth, who is an important dialogue partner for me in all of these matters, intends to address this particularly intensively as the next President of the ifa. This is something that I am looking forward to tremendously! 
In so doing, our assumption is that art and culture and academia and education, when taken seriously with their freedoms, open up a different world and a different mode of perception, thought and experience. 
Yugoslavia, Greece and Albania were occupied in 1941, and their territories were divided between the Germans and their allies, which, until 1943, primarily included Fascist Italy. 
After Mussolini’s fall from power, German units assumed control of all occupied areas. 
I experienced this for myself in my small home town of Goslar, where, thanks to civic engagement, thanks to the artists of the Kaiserring, access to culture is made possible in a most tangible way. Moreover, I am delighted that we had an opportunity to support a similar experiment, namely documenta in Athens and Kassel, in precisely this way. 
Most Jews in Italy and Albania managed to hide until the end of the war. 
The reading will be followed by a discussion between the editors of the volume – Sara Berger, Erwin Lewin, Sanela Schmid and Maria Vassilikou – and the project coordinator Susanne Heim. The discussion will be chaired by Stefan Reinecke of the taz newspaper. 
In so doing, we believe that we need bridge-builders between cultures more urgently than ever before if we intend to overcome the straitjacket of nationalism. 
In the 19th century, the Palace’s dome symbolised, to all intents and purposes, the illiberal alliance between the throne and the altar against the bourgeoisie. 
this is not so much a question of symbols and icons as of filling rooms and buildings with the substance of democracy! 
Minister of State Roth will welcome guests to the event. Wolfgang Schieder of Cologne University will make introductory remarks. Thereafter actress Anette Daugardt will read from the source materials. 
We can do this not only by making the collections accessible in digital form, 
Particularly invaluable are the authenticity and original voice of these documents, which have been painstakingly researched and prepared and many of which are published here for the first time. 
Instead, we should forge new trust in the power of culture and enlightenment. 
In the realm of Cultural Relations Policy, for which the Federal Foreign Office bears responsibility, we are resolutely pursuing the path of opening and compassion, as Willy Brandt once called it. 
And we must come to the aid of those who have to flee in the face of nationalist pressure. 
Allow me, of course, to combine this appeal to the power of the culture of enlightenment with my particular thanks to the Members of the German Bundestag. 
None of this would have been possible without the support of the Bundestag, and especially the responsible subcommittee and the Budget Committee! 
Here are just a few examples:

If there were one place where the boundaries between the internal and the external are becoming blurred, then it is here in Europe. 
Perhaps I wouldn’t have become the convinced European that I am today had I not gone on a visit to England in my youth. 
For the first time, Training for International Diplomats is organising a special course for younger diplomats from Colombia. 
I believe that we face a huge task especially among those who, for material reasons, but also owing to educational privation, have no access to cultural exchanges. 
This is why we also believe that gratitude is the friendliest way to ask a favour. 
Participants will be able to forge important contacts, make friends and build professional networks. 
If I praise the Budget Committee now, then I think it’s clear to everyone what comes next. 
The programme also includes visits to institutions engaged in Colombia as well as to the German Bundestag, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, political foundations and Deutsche Welle. 
It was they who worked with great commitment to ensure that we also have the funds for this. 
In addition to the chance to increase their understanding of political and social life in Germany and Europe, participants will have the opportunity to broaden their professional skills and experience through lectures, workshops and a trip to the Federal City of Bonn. 
As the Ukraine conflict is so entrenched in the politics between states, we are committed to fostering civil society exchanges both with and in the countries of the Eastern Partnership. 
As the current emergency situations of forced migration not only call for a political solution and humanitarian assistance, but since culture is also a vehicle for humanity, we are working in such a wide variety of areas here. 
Overcoming thinking in terms of the nation state and empathy with our closest friends and partners calls for a very deliberate and targeted policy. 
By the way, this is something that has preoccupied me for years. 
This also requires a different approach on the part of our institutions and project executing organisations, as well as more funding, of course. 
But we also have incredible opportunities in our country. 
That would be my objective at any rate. 
And I firmly believe 
we can work together to ensure that blurring of the boundaries between the internal and external not only gives rise to uncertainty and fear, 
but also to a thirst for knowledge, zest for life and an interest in the unknown. 
I am delighted that we have set up so many cooperative partnerships here in Germany and with German institutions and that we will continue to expand these. 
Allow me to thank you most sincerely for this cooperation. 
Reforms, after all, are not an end in themselves, but rather in the interest of the country. 
Tahiri and Roth also spoke about regional cooperation, which is a prerequisite for economic development and drawing the country closer to the EU. 
We expect dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to finally make some progress. 
Europe is the future that all sides share, and it is on Europe that the young generation in both countries is pinning its hopes. 
Germany and Kosovo: bilateral relations 
Kosovo’s future is in the EU 
By the way, one of these is an artistic treatment of extremely difficult topics in the coming year. 
So “Goethe mit Frankreich” and “La France avec Goethe”. 
There will be around ten joint locations to this end in the next four years. 
Firstly, we are not building entire structures of our own unnecessarily, 
From our commitment to protecting World Cultural Heritage, to which Minister of State Böhmer, as President of the responsible UNESCO committee, has devoted herself so resolutely, to the German Archaeological Institute and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which are working together to promote the cause of preservation and reconstruction in Syria together with 20 other institutions as part of an international project. 
There are countless other similar examples. 
especially in times of crisis and in crisis regions, we must step up our efforts to facilitate the preservation of and access to culture and education. 
It wasn’t just open to the best of the best, recruiting students from the Humboldt and Oxford, so to speak, 
but also included Kassel-Nord, Goslar and Herne in its remit. 
Many of our funding programmes reach an incredible number of young people, but relatively often these are young people from families that could afford to do that anyway. 
And, at the same time, we have secondary modern schools in Germany where 90 percent of the pupils don’t leave the city in the summer holidays. 
Making this possible once again is one of the objectives for the coming years. 
Secondly, we intend to support city twinning projects once again if they promote such exchanges between citizens. 
I therefore believe that we have much to do and great tasks ahead of us as far as the internal and external are concerned. 
“Look back, think forward” is our slogan for the remembrance days. 
We have also approached the Goethe-Institut and the Insitut Français, as well as our Dutch and Swedish partners and German and Turkish foundations with the idea of opening joint European cultural centres in Turkey. 
We set aside one million euros last week to help establish these centres in Gaziantep, Dyarbarkir and Izmir. 
These efforts include two new developments that are important also to me especially in light of the current situation. 
Above all, we are attempting, together with our European partners, to find a common approach from conception to implementation. 
We need more than just European partners though! 
Whether it be the language work and funds for schools and branches of the Goethe-Institut. 
Whether it be the creation of cultural spaces or reforming Cultural Relations Policy to make it a policy of civil societies. 
They remind us that, 
At the next Franco-German Council of Ministers, we will propose that the branches of the Goethe-Institut and the Insitut Français be brought closer together where only one of the two has a presence. 
but are strengthening those in the region with our expertise and thereby helping to preserve and expand existing spaces in both a literal and metaphorical sense. 
With the power of culture and enlightenment, we will be able to forge connections and ties both between and within our societies. 
Both sides underscored the importance of the so-called Berlin Process, which was established by European countries to achieve tangible progress in areas such as infrastructure and energy networks, as well as regional youth exchange. 
Minister of State for Europe Roth said that Germany was ready, together with its EU partners, to provide additional support to Kosovo. However, he also clearly stated that 
the future of Kosovo, and that of all other Western Balkan countries, is in the EU. 
What we urgently need now, however, is a stable government in Pristina that drives forward reforms which finally bring the people benefits. 
The young generation in particular needs opportunities at home. 
Overcoming obstruction and finger-pointing 
The obstruction and finger-pointing between Kosovo and Serbia must be ended without delay. 
It is especially the task of the elected politicians to achieve substantial results on reconciliation. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth recently held his latest meeting with Edita Tahiri, Kosovo’s Minister for Dialogue, to exchange views on the future of Kosovo and of the region 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth recently held his latest meeting with Edita Tahiri, Kosovo’s Minister for Dialogue, to exchange views on the future of the Western Balkan country and of the entire region. 
The prospect of EU membership is for real. 
Michael Roth emphasized the following: 
They set a new text extolling the virtues of civic spirit to the melody of an old song, an old ode singing the praises of the nobility, in what was essentially a form of “reconstruction”. 
It is plain to see that we can no longer shield ourselves from the course of things, from the crises in Europe, the conflicts in the Middle East, from the wave of authoritarian modes of government, such as in Turkey, and their consequences in the form of global migratory movements. 
the technological revolution that is digitisation, the economic competition in industry and the political challenge to the established international power of the West, as well as the trials and tribulations of a society of immigration are also increasing the fear of powerlessness among many people here, especially among those who no longer feel that they count or are represented. 
Europe is complicated and there are simpler recipes, such as cultural sovereignty or identity. 
There is a new authoritarianism. 
And this new authoritarianism is the biggest challenge facing our liberal democracies as we know them. 
Those who form an alliance with the strong – in this case the US – are friends and may be accorded benefits. 
Those who don’t do this but define their own interests or even consider cultural differences to be necessary are enemies and are opposed. 
Essentially, we are talking here about nationalism pure and simple, which ultimately entails isolation and denigration of people, societies, countries and cultures – 
There will be an opportunity for us to come up with an idea on this in the coming year. 
The two-week programme will enable the participants to deepen their knowledge of Germany’s political system and of federalism. 
as a beacon, indeed as a fundamental law for our actions, it doesn’t set out what is a reality, but what should be a reality – and is therefore an obligation for each and every individual! 
We did this not only to find out about their experiences, but also to face up to this responsibility. 
In order to do this, we also have to talk to people who think differently and who we find to be difficult. 
However, the question that we actually need to ask in view of this very metropolitan debate is this: 
Together with the museums here in Berlin, with the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and the Federal Foreign Office, we are working to ensure that enjoying the sight of this World Cultural Heritage is no longer contingent upon buying a plane ticket to Berlin. 
Instead, we want to facilitate joint access to these objects and their history across continents and also the current discussions surrounding the new Silk Road that we are focusing on with such intensity in the worlds of business and politics. 
one which can then be supplemented with new tangible forms. 
Not abusing culture as a sphere of distinction for isolation and denigration, but seeing it as the unifying force between countries, peoples and individuals with the most diverse backgrounds. 
Particularly in light of such a decisive question for the makeup of our country, we need, more than ever before, these experiences from abroad in order to have a greater cultural impact on the domestic stage! 
I would like to tentatively point out that the times when you are no longer able to separate the internal and external are more strenuous than when you could keep the two apart. 
In his great speech to mark its birthday, Navid Kermani stated that 
Federal Foreign Office on the peace agreement for the Central African Republic 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (21 June) on the peace agreement for the Central African Republic: 
This constitutes a major step after many years of internal conflict and the current rise in the number of armed confrontations. 
We call upon all parties now to resolutely implement the agreements that have been reached. 
The fighting must stop. 
The people of Central Africa urgently need peace and security in order to be able to rebuild their country. 
Understanding through dialogue: 
Gabriel intends to revive Council of the Baltic Sea States 
The Council of the Baltic Sea States, which promotes the dialogue between Russia and the other Baltic Sea states, has not met at the political level since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Reykjavik for an anniversary meeting on Tuesday (20 June). 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and his counterparts: 
family photo at the meeting of the Council of the Baltic Sea States 
The Federal Foreign Office provides considerable support and funding for international mediation projects run by Sant'Egidio throughout the world. 
“It is thanks to the Icelanders that we have met once again despite this difficult situation”, said Gabriel in Reykjavik. 
Dialogue – also with Russia 
Symbol of freedom: 
At the meeting in Reykjavik, Foreign Minister Gabriel called for cooperation in the Council of the Baltic Sea States to be strengthened. 
“I very much hope that this was a new beginning”, said the Foreign Minister. 
Gabriel intends to use the Council of the Baltic Sea States as an opportunity to promote cooperation and dialogue – also with Russia. 
Professor Andrea Riccardi, who founded the community in 1968 while still at school, was awarded the Charlemagne Prize in 2009 on behalf of Sant'Egidio and its work. 
Cooperation in this forum is therefore an important step towards rebuilding lost trust in the Baltic Sea region. 
In Rome on Monday, the Government of the Central African Republic and rebel groups reached an agreement on common elements to establish peace through the mediation of the Catholic lay Community of Sant'Egidio. 
Great respect is due to the persistence and commitment of Sant'Egidio, which made a consensus possible. 
Germany is already supporting numerous project initiatives of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, for example in the area of youth exchanges, academia and environmental protection, as well as the joint fight against human trafficking. 
On 19 June 2017, a comprehensive peace agreement including all the armed groups in the country was signed on the premises and through the mediation of the Catholic lay Community of Sant'Egidio in Rome. 
The Community of Sant'Egidio is active throughout the world and has approximately 75,000 members in more than 70 countries. Besides Europe, it has a particularly strong presence in Africa. 
Sant'Egidio's international peace and mediation activities first became known as a result of the successful negotiations on Mozambique from 1990 to 1992, when a 16-year-long civil war was brought to an end through negotiations in Rome. 
Germany as a founding member 
Germany is a founding member of the Council of the Baltic Sea States. 
In 1992, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his Danish counterpart Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, decided to establish a new forum for cooperation in the Baltic Sea region against the backdrop of the upheavals following the fall of the Iron Curtain. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel standing beside a section of the Berlin Wall in Reykjavik 
Foreign Minister Gabriel attended a meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Council of the Baltic Sea States in Reykjavik on Tuesday (20 June). 
It had been four years since the body last met at ministerial level. 
Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 has made it impossible to continue everyday cooperation in the forum. 
Since the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine, the Council of the Baltic Sea States is one of the few remaining dialogue forums that Russia still attends. 
Cooperation in the Baltic Sea region is becoming increasingly important also as far as the European Union is concerned. 
In addition to its mediation work, Sant'Egidio is engaged in people-oriented development projects, particularly in Africa. In Italy, its country of origin, it is also deeply involved in charitable projects and refugee assistance. 
Ahmed al-Assir is a Sunni preacher of hate who shocked all of Lebanon. 
In 2013, he and his followers engaged in an armed clash with the Lebanese army that lasted several hours. 
The shootout occurred in the heart of a residential area and ended with 34 people being killed – 19 soldiers and 15 supporters of the radical cleric. 
Suddenly, Lebanon seemed to be on the brink of a civil war. 
They trust and respect one another: 
Feras Kheirallah, Head of the Berghof Foundation’s Beirut Office (right), Sheikh Muhammed Abu Zaid, a cleric and judge in Sidon (centre) and Lara Azzam, Project Manager, Lebanon. 
It soon became clear that something had to be done to prevent further radicalisation in Lebanon – and the Federal Foreign Office offered to help. 
Stabilising a small country that had taken in around one million refugees from its neighbour Syria is, of course, also in Germany’s interest. 
Over 800 visitors attended the Annual Forum of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region at the Federal Foreign Office just one week prior to this meeting. 
Germany, Denmark, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Russia are currently members of the Council. 
The Foreign Ministers of the Council of the Baltic Sea States met in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik on Tuesday (20 June) on the occasion of the forum’s 25th anniversary. 
That was the only way to resolve conflicts without violence. 
Sunnis in Lebanon are not sufficiently well-organised to systematically fight radicalisation, or to articulate the needs of Sunnis as a social group. 
However, communication between, and balancing the interests of, the three roughly equally large religious groups in Lebanon – Sunnis, Shiites and Christians – is essential for Lebanon, which has already suffered through a civil war that lasted more than 15 years. 
Between the mid-1970s and 1990, more than 140,000 people were killed, and 800,000 were forced to flee the country. 
If it were to slip back into civil war, the country with only 6 million inhabitants would rapidly collapse, considering that it must bear the burden of sheltering approximately 1 million Syrian refugees. 
Creating a forum for dialogue within the Sunni community 
The problem is that 
“so far, Dar al-Fatwa was not a place of public debate,” says Feras Kheirallah, who oversees the project for the Berghof Foundation. 
The organisation has never had precise goals or a vision. It therefore needs to be thoroughly modernised. 
Sheikh Muhammed Abu Zaid, pictured standing in front of his mosque in Sidon, works to prevent radicalisation among Sunnis 
Kheirallah has found a partner for pursuing this process in Sheikh Abu Zaid, the cleric who took over the congregation of the firebrand cleric after the shootout in Sidon. It includes the “car park” mosque as well as a splendid new mosque that the extremist cleric al-Assir was planning to move into soon. 
Up to now, however, Dar al-Fatwa has had a hard time initiating discussions among Sunnis about the causes of radicalisation, and thereby directly addressing the problems. There are simply too many apprehensions about approaching the other members of society. 
The organisation does not know how to deal with controversy and conflicts, or how to engage in social discourse. 
Getting young people involved and responding to their need for guidance 
In the past, young people were never involved or asked to give their opinion, despite the fact that they have the strongest need for guidance and can easily be lured by radical ideas. 
“Berghof was the first to get people who normally never speak to one another to engage in discussions,” says Omar Kayed, a young journalist and expert on Islam who has extensive knowledge about radicalised youth. 
“This gets people thinking, and that is the only way we will find a solution.” 
Working to build bridges and fight radicalisation in Lebanon 
“It was in this very mosque,” says Abu Zaid, stopping under a squeaking ceiling fan, “that Ahmed al-Assir became radicalised.” 
Abu Zaid is personable and has a good sense of humour. He experienced the outbreak of violence in Sidon first hand and knows many of the prominent figures in the Sunni community. 
“Already by listening to one another, the ice is broken, and this can help to de-radicalise.” 
She emphasises it is thanks to the forum created by the Berghof Foundation that, as a woman, she can even engage with Dar al-Fatwa on religious issues. 
Just allowing for opinions other than its own to be expressed is already a big step for Dar al-Fatwa. 
“In pursuing stabilisation, it is our aim to get political processes moving,” says Rüdiger König, the Federal Foreign Office’s Director-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation and Post‑Conflict Reconstruction. 
The Federal Government therefore provides funding for the work of the Berghof Foundation, a German NGO that specialises in conflict transformation and promoting peace (http://www.berghof-foundation.org) and creates space for political dialogue. 
Political stability in the country therefore also hinges on the political engagement of the Sunni community, so that they can fight radicalisation. 
This is why Berghof Foundation is advising Dar al-Fatwa, the highest Sunni authority in the country, in the hope that it will become a forum for political dialogue and that it can one day provide greater guidance and leadership for the Sunnis of Lebanon. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (22 June) on the occasion of the Uganda Solidarity Summit on Refugees, which is taking place in Kampala today and tomorrow: 
“The civil war in South Sudan has forced a large part of the population to flee their homes. 
They are being cared for and even integrated in Uganda with the support of international aid organisations. 
This model refugee policy needs our support. 
The situation of the refugees in Uganda is closely bound up with the development of the humanitarian emergency in South Sudan. 
I also call on the governments in the region to support political processes seeking to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict in South Sudan.” 
Aside from refugees from South Sudan, Uganda is hosting almost 320,000 refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia and other countries. 
Refugees in Uganda enjoy freedom of movement and are given land, seed and tools to help them fend for themselves. 
Sheikh Muhammed Abu Zaid walks across the worn carpet in his stocking feet. 
The prayer room is as charming as an underground car park and located on the ground floor of a large apartment building in the coastal town of Sidon. 
Al-Assir was radicalised by Islamist fighters in Syria and became prepared to use violence. He had no qualms about inciting hatred against the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which had chosen to back the Syrian regime. 
Getting political processes moving to stabilise the country 
Currently, most Sunni groups are either strongly political or thoroughly religious organisations, so that Sunnis cannot be represented by a single one. 
The topic of radicalisation is so controversial that even initiating a dialogue can be viewed as accepting both the blame and responsibility for it. 
It is therefore easier to get this dialogue going when it is organised by an outsider – like the Berghof Foundation. 
One of the young Sunnis that the Berghof Foundation has involved in these debates is Hanadi Najib, who hosts religious radio programmes. 
Against the backdrop of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees as well as reception capacities that have been exhausted and a general reduction in the availability of land, Uganda’s refugee policy is reaching its limits. 
The Federal Government is supporting the CRRF’s comprehensive approach in Uganda with development policy measures and humanitarian assistance. 
Our policy is helping to ensure that the causes of displacement are tackled and that the absorption capacity of countries and regions taking in refugees is strengthened. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the UN Solidarity Summit on Refugees in Uganda 
Over one million people have sought protection and aid in Uganda. 
It is continuing to take in refugees from neighbouring countries nevertheless. 
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Ugandan Government have therefore issued an invitation to a Solidarity Summit in Kampala. 
The objective is to obtain further urgently needed support from the international community. 
We are using this money to support the people suffering in South Sudan and in the affected neighbouring countries, especially Uganda. 
This makes Uganda the biggest refugee-hosting country in Africa. Uganda is a country whose population already faces great humanitarian, economic and social challenges. 
Statistics published on the refugee situation around the world (Global Trends 2016), published by UNHCR on 19 June 2017, have found that Uganda is the fourth-largest refugee-hosting country in the world. 
Uganda’s refugee policy has a strong focus on development and is held up around the world as a model for the integration of refugees into host communities. 
The drought in many parts of East Africa is sparking further migration to Uganda – including from Kenya. 
This makes Germany the world’s second-largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid today. 
In view of the suffering of countless people in South Sudan and the burden that the neighbouring countries are bearing, I urgently call on the Government of South Sudan and all adversaries in the region to end their violent clashes and the serious human rights violations against the civilian population without delay. 
Uganda is the biggest refugee-hosting country in Africa having now taken in 1,270,000 refugees. 
It has taken in some 1,025,000 refugees from South Sudan since 2013, with the majority of that number arriving after July 2016. 
Thanks to its exemplary policy, Uganda is among the first countries to implement the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) adopted in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration. Alongside guaranteeing the rights of refugees and ensuring that they receive the humanitarian aid they need, the CRRF sets out approaches to resolving refugee situations in the long term. 
Around 1.9 million South Sudanese people have fled to the neighbouring countries of Uganda, the Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Congo and the Central African Republic. 
We are viewing this with great concern and have increased the Federal Government’s humanitarian assistance for South Sudan to around 90 million euros in 2017. 
Germany will therefore support Uganda’s refugee policy with around 50 million euros, of which 14 million euros have been earmarked for humanitarian assistance and 36 million euros for development cooperation. 
The Federal Foreign Office supported humanitarian aid projects in Africa to the tune of around 1.3 billion euros in 2016. 
Of these funds, some 307 million euros went to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) – more than ever before. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s contribution to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to support South Sudanese refugees and internally displaced persons in South Sudan has been increased from an initial sum of five million to approximately 31 million euros. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the agreement on a harvest ceasefire in eastern Ukraine 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (22 June) on the agreement on a harvest ceasefire in eastern Ukraine: 
Far too many people have lost their lives in recent months along the contact line. 
This makes it all the more important that the ceasefire agreed a long time ago is now finally respected and that both sides can start with the overdue withdrawal of heavy weapons and the disengagement of troops. 
It is however also important that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission is able to monitor the agreed ceasefire. 
The attacks and the massive hindrances that they have been subjected to in recent days and weeks, above all in areas not under the control of the Government, must halt without delay. 
It is good that the conflicting parties agreed yesterday through OSCE mediation on a harvest ceasefire which is to apply all along the contact line from midnight on Saturday. 
We worked hard for this in the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk. 
Such a ceasefire is not only going to make it possible to bring in the harvest, it is also intended to save lives. 
To do so, the monitors need unhindered and secure access to the entire conflict area. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the death of ex-Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
Published in the Spiegel on 22 June 2017 
It was during the Bundestag election campaign of 1976, which pitched 
Helmut Schmidt against Helmut Kohl. 
Speech by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth on the presentation of the 14th volume of the book project 
-- Translation of advance text -- 
And we young Socialists held up our hand-painted poster 
Prof. Wolfgang Schieder, Dr Susanne Heim, Esteemed guests, 
The fact that he remained in office for so long was due to his single-minded desire for power, his exceptional political instincts and the firm convictions he held as a German and European patriot. These can be summed up in a single sentence: 
Never again should there be war in Europe. 
Back then, I thought of Kohl as the eternal Chancellor. 
I have often asked myself where someone like that came from – someone who with astonishing endurance first sought democratic power and then successfully wielded it and clung to it in the face of so much resistance. 
The young Kohl was a party moderniser who rose rapidly in the provinces. He never denied his provincial roots, although he was ridiculed for them from early on in his political career. 
Kohl bore it without a word of public complaint, he simply sat it out, and ultimately emerged as a cult figure. 
But at the time, nobody thought he had the makings of a historic statesman. 
The fact that this volume on occupied southeast Europe and Italy is being presented here at the Federal Foreign Office shows that 
The critical moment came in the middle of his Chancellorship, when it came down to doing the right thing for his country and for Europe. 
This is also reflected by documents in this volume. 
During the months after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl paved the way for German unity and for conciliation in Europe. 
Without him there would have been no Maastricht Treaty and no single currency. 
His domestic achievements after 16 long years in power were not nearly as impressive. 
“Reformstau” - a backlog of reforms – was the word of the year in 1997. 
It was above all his self-righteous attitude in the light of these transgressions that prevented his political legacy from being heralded during his lifetime. 
He stood in his own way. 
Triumph and tragedy were only a hair’s breadth apart, in his private life too. 
What remains? 
After losing his post as Chancellor in 1998, the dark side of Kohl’s at times complete dominance over the CDU became ever more apparent, a dark side that keen observers had always supposed was there. 
He had an instinct for hitting the right note, for tempo and timing. 
He was a maker of history of almost Shakespearean proportions. 
Speaking at the marketplace in Goslar, Kohl extolled the virtues of freedom over socialism. 
Especially in the final years of his Chancellorship, a proverbial “mildew” had settled on Germany. 
He was a great patriot – and a great European. 
I was 16 when I first consciously took note of Helmut Kohl. 
Father and figurehead 
In those days, election campaigns were still far more suffused with ideology than they are today, and one may wonder if Helmut Kohl himself might later have seen the funny side of branding Helmut Schmidt an illiberal Socialist. 
What mockery and malice he endured! 
He was taunted by the media, by cabaretists, satirists and impersonators from the start of his Chancellorship. No CEO in the private sector would have put up with this media frenzy for more than three months! 
He evinced that courage to take risks which one only sees in those who are ready and able to take decisive action at such moments in history. 
He enjoyed international confidence as the guarantor of a peaceful Germany. 
He was perceived as a provincial politician, but he had no qualms about turning the wheel of history. 
During his time in office, the media also took great pleasure in broadcasting his mistakes. 
His outstanding political achievements for the cause of freedom and for coexistence in Germany and Europe still reverberate today. 
As a passionate European, Kohl completed the project begun by his predecessors in office, Adenauer, Brandt and Schmidt, of making the Franco-German friendship part of Germany’s raison d’état. 
And when one looks at Europe today and at the recurring strangely pusillanimous debates on our country’s financial contributions to this same Europe, a return of this Kohlean passion seems highly desirable. 
He was always aware that the corollary of a single currency was a willingness to shoulder mutual responsibility at some cost to us Germans. 
But for Kohl, those were investments in our own future, which would pay dividends for the Germans in particular. 
Thessaloniki had been a city with an unmistakable Jewish identity for many centuries. 
The Holocaust almost completely destroyed this proud tradition and left deep wounds and scars in the metropolis. 
“Everyone is selling their things on the street so as to have something to eat. 
with the words, “Allow yourselves to be duped by Kohl and you'll be fleeced by Strauß,” complete with a caricature of Kohl with an ostrich (Strauß in German) on his shoulder. 
When Kohl became Chancellor, I was a young student. When he left office, I was Chairman of the SPD Parliamentary Group in Lower Saxony. 
Kohl himself is said to have foretold the end of his Chancellorship, allegedly jotting “Schröder, 1998” on a beermat. 
This story, too, was just like him, since nobody in his party had the courage or the strength to challenge or topple him. 
He was the father and figurehead of “his” CDU, which he ruled like no other before. His grip on power was absolute. 
His refusal to name the big donors – who have remained unknown to this day – and his way of dealing with party donations in general has profoundly scarred “his” CDU, as well as his political life-time achievements. 
He never treated the smaller EU member states with condescension. 
Much greater than I ever could have suspected back in Goslar in 1976. 
The German Consulate General’s secret report of 15 March 1943 is also included in the volume. 
In this document, the then Consul General Dr Fritz Schönberg uses unsettling and bureaucratic language to describe the beginning of the deportations to Berlin: 
“The resettlement of the 56,000 Jews with Greek nationality living in the locality began today with the deportation of 2600 persons from Saloniki to the General Government. 
This powerful gesture of reconciliation, the outstretched hand of friendship, moved me greatly. 
The future always requires us to remember the past! 
He and his closest family survived the Holocaust. 
The circumstances were terrible. 
In light of current events, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Government’s position on freedom of religion. 
For this reason I want to take this opportunity to reject in no uncertain terms statements which are quite evidently intended to deny people in Germany the right to freely practise their religion and restrict their right to freedom of expression. 
New Franco-German offensive for Europe 
Gabriel and Le Drian draw up new strategies for a stronger EU. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his counterpart Le Drian. 
Making Europe stronger 
“We must not leave it to others to decide Europeans’ fate”, said Gabriel in Paris. 
Together with Le Drian, he called for a “stronger Europe”. 
The two Foreign Minister emphasised that Europe should be strengthened both internally and externally. 
Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the statements by the Turkish authority Diyanet 
Franco-German cooperation is a priority 
Working together for a stronger Europe: 
Gabriel in Paris 
The Franco-German Council of Ministers meets at least once each year 
with the two cabinets convening for a joint meeting. 
The two Ministers met in Paris today (23 June) to prepare for the Franco-German Council of Ministers on 13 July. 
This new initiative will be launched at the Franco-German Council of Ministers in July. 
how, where, when and in what way people pursue and practise their religion is no concern of the state. 
These meetings are coordinated by the Foreign Ministers. 
Cooperation between Germany and France is therefore coordinated directly at the highest political level. 
according to our understanding, the state certainly has no competence to pass judgement on theological issues, but rather has the obligation to protect freedom of religion to the same extent as freedom of expression and of the media. 
I would specifically like to add that 
Regular consultations have been held between the two Governments since the signing of the Élysée Treaty in 1963. 
On the 40th anniversary of the Treaty in 2003, these consultations were then replaced by annual ministerial councils. 
Measures included a European approach to combating youth unemployment and greater cooperation in foreign and defence policy, they added. 
The Federal Government does so, and is deeply committed to this obligation, without exception. 
Freedom of religion in Germany is a valuable asset, a fundamental and constitutional right, a right that is expressly guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, a right that has the same status in our constitution and our political activities as freedom of expression and of the media.

The United Nations have appointed a new Special Representative in Libya. 
Relations between Germany and the Baltic states are exemplary 
The Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement at the governmental press conference on 23 June: 
We were very surprised and, to be honest, quite concerned by some statements, including those of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, Diyanet, a Turkish state authority under the responsibility of the Turkish Prime Minister. 
Several weeks ago we hosted a large conference on the responsibility of religions for peace at the Federal Foreign Office here in Berlin. All the participants, and specifically the representatives of the major monotheistic religions, agreed on the responsibility that the religions and their representatives bear for peace in the world as well as for dialogue and exchange, and on the importance of respect for how others practise their religion. 
This required perseverance and a constant willingness to communicate, also with difficult political actors, both in the international arena and in Libya. 
Martin Kobler always emphasised that the only way for the country’s population to enjoy peace, security and a share of the wealth of the Libyan nation is through a political compromise. 
It is important to Mr Kunio to pass these experiences on to the younger generation – to call these memories to mind, despite the pain. 
The Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson today (23 June) thanked Salamé’s predecessor, the German diplomat Martin Kobler, for his tireless commitment. 
This is a good opportunity to again expressly thank Ambassador Martin Kobler for the tireless commitment he has shown during the nearly two years he served as United Nations Special Representative in Libya. 
Time and again, Martin Kobler made numerous proposals and launched many initiatives, putting forward new ways to solve the conflict. 
He systematically involved regional and international actors, and he enhanced the important, indeed key role played by the United Nations in finding a solution to the conflict in Libya. 
Martin Kobler was the United Nations’ point man in Libya, and he showed true personal courage, also by repeatedly getting out of his car in Tripoli, even if this meant ignoring the advice of his security advisers, so that he could speak directly with the people in the street: in the marketplace, in hospitals and even in the horrible detention centres where refugees are being housed. 
What Martin Kobler has done in the humane and courageous performance of his duties as Special Representative is most deeply respected and greatly appreciated. 
This is why this publishing project, which sheds light on many original documents, the overwhelming majority of which are being published for the first time, is so important. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is planning new initiatives for a stronger Europe together with his counterpart Jean‑Yves Le Drian. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Paris on Friday (23 June) to develop new Franco-German strategies for European cooperation together with his French counterpart Jean‑Yves Le Drian. 
We cannot undo the past. 
But we can help ensure that the injustice that was perpetrated is never repeated. 
This, the darkest chapter in the history of humanity, must never be forgotten. 
This book project is committed to this aim. 
In her welcome speech, Minister of State Böhmer acknowledged the good and close relations between Germany and the three Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
The cross-party Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States is one of the largest parliamentary friendship groups in the Bundestag. 
It was founded in 1992, just a few months after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania gained their independence. 
On 1 May 2004 the Baltic states joined the EU and NATO. 
The euro is valid legal tender in all three Baltic states.

Ghassan Salamé appointed new UN Special Representative in Libya 
Former Lebanese Minister of Culture Ghassan Salamé is at the same time becoming Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. 
Here is the statement issued by Foreign Office Spokesperson Martin Schäfer at the governmental press conference on 23 June 2017: 
On behalf of the Federal Government, I want to say that we wish Mr Salamé the best of luck as he assumes his new tasks in Libya. It is a truly complex political environment, both inside the country and internationally. We hope he will have the good fortune he needs to achieve progress on the very difficult dossier of Libya. 
I can assure you that Germany will do everything it can to support the efforts of both the United Nations and Mr Salamé to bring about an inclusive political solution in the country. 
I want to thank him for this, also on behalf of the Federal Government. 
Libya country profile 
Important partners for Germany in the EU 
The Minister of State also emphasised the central role that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania played as important partners for Germany in Europe and the European Union. 
The Baltic states are an integral part of Europe. 
Their citizens know that their future lies in the EU. 
Relations between Germany and the Baltic states are a role model for the kind of cooperation and cohesion that we are striving for throughout the EU. 
We are counting on the Baltic states when it comes to shaping the future of Europe. 
Chairman Alois Karl then provided an overview of the legislative term and the activities of the Parliamentary Friendship Group. 
Maria Böhmer, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, together with Alois Karl, Chairman of the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States, hosted a dinner at Villa Borsig. 
She said that the three states enjoyed close ties with Germany at political, economic and cultural level, 
She pointed out that the three Baltic states had managed to embrace their regained independence in 1991 as an opportunity, overcome challenges and emerge stronger from the economic and social upheavals of the 1990s. 
He said that he was grateful for the good relations and expressed the hope that in future Germany would take a stronger lead on European and security policy issues. 
According to Karl, the highlights were two visits by delegations to the Baltic region and two exchange visits from Baltic delegations at the invitation of the group. 
“The persecution and murder of European Jews by National Socialist Germany from 1933 to 1945 – Occupied southeast Europe and Italy” 
This quote by Johann Gottfried von Herder could be a mission statement for the book that we are presenting here at the Federal Foreign Office today. 
its 812 pages in a mint-green jacket cover. 
The objective of the project is the comprehensive academic publication of central sources and documents on the history of the persecution and murder of the Jewish population on the basis of archive material from around the world. 
we are not shying away here at this Ministry from (self-)critical engagement with the darkest chapter of German history. 
At the end of the day, the Federal Foreign Office also shared responsibility for the expulsion, oppression and murder of Jews in the National Socialist era. 
This Jewish community, which was once so great and proud, suffered in an especially tragic way under the Nazi occupation. 
This volume traces the fate of the Jews in Greece over 150 pages and with more than one hundred documents. 
Instructions, communications from authorities, private letters and diary entries, as well as newspaper articles and reports by foreign observers are referenced in the process and provide an unfiltered record. 
People are wasting money as if it were water. They are throwing money out of the window and letting anyone who wants to have all of their property. 
[…] It’s like we’re in a bad dream day and night and we’re living in indescribable fear.

We have, for instance, supported the efforts to renovate the Monasteriotes synagogue. 
We are also fostering a Jewish education centre and summer gatherings of young people from Greece, Israel, Germany and other countries. 
And now a Greek Holocaust museum is being set up in Thessaloniki, which the Federal Government is lending its active support. 
This is more than a museum. It can restore some of the city’s Jewish identity and serve as a meeting place for future generations. 
And he studied the past there and gave the victims back their names. 
And yet there are fewer and fewer of these eyewitnesses in our midst today. 
This volume is the product of a great deal of work – conducting source research, reaching decisions on selections and editing. 
The authors are making the voices of eyewitnesses – both victims and perpetrators – heard with these original documents. 
It is up to the reader to draw their own conclusions. 
It is important that we engage in scholarly treatment of the Holocaust also from a foreign and European policy perspective. 
And yet this project, which began in 2003 with a new volume added to the compendium each year since then, is nothing less than a written memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe. 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer invited the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States to a dinner at Villa Borsig. 
The guests included the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States at the Bundestag, Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sven Mikser and representatives of the Baltic states. 
Stmin Böhmer mit … Minister of State Maria Böhmer with Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sven Mikser (next to the Minister of State) and the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States FFO 
In his words of thanks, Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sven Mikser stressed that cooperation was very successful and close because the values and interests of the Baltic states and Germany were compatible. 
He pointed out that the group can look back on more than 50 events in the current legislative term, including many high-ranking visits. 
Germany and Estonia: bilateral relations 
Not only that, but its unique Jewish life – its culture, its academic heritage, its economy – was almost completely eradicated. 
For example, in document 235 you can read the long letter by Nehama Kazes from Thessaloniki to her sons in Athens, in which she uses haunting language to describe the dramatic situation in Thessaloniki: 
In Thessaloniki, I’ve often made a point of meeting up with Heinz Kunio, who is celebrating his 90th birthday this week. 
Since he spoke German, Heinz Kunio was ordered to translate the commands of the SS from German into Greek on the ramp at Auschwitz – which meant that he saw countless members of his community pass by him on the way to a cruel death in the gas chambers of the extermination camp. 
In 1945, he was one of the few survivors to come back to Thessaloniki, returning to a city whose Jewish identity had been almost entirely erased by the Nazis. 
He wrote an impressive book about his time in Auschwitz entitled “A litre of soup and 60 grams of bread – diary of prisoner no. 109565”. 
These encounters with eyewitnesses, their personal memories, are irreplaceable. 
Without an awareness of this history, we Germans – despite all our best efforts to promote understanding and reconciliation – will never be able to do justice to these countries and the role that we play there. 
Allow me to thank all those who have played an active part in making it a reality. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (26 June) to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture: 
It violates human dignity. 
Every year the Federal Foreign Office supports a range of projects around the world aimed at combating torture. 
Today I would like to express my special thanks and respect to all those working in this field. 
The definition does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. 
Torture is always prohibited under all circumstances. 
Today, on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, as well as on any other day, we must oppose this in no uncertain terms. 
The ban on torture is absolute, both nationally and internationally. 
Although prevention is vitally important, we also have to deal with the consequences of torture. 
The effects persist, often for the rest of the victim’s life. 
Overcoming this suffering is an intensive and often lengthy process. 
Treatment centres, including those in Germany, offer torture victims safe spaces where they can receive help to come to grips with what they have experienced. 
Nevertheless, torture – in many different forms – is still taking place throughout the world. 
As the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights at the Federal Foreign Office, I am confronted time and again in my daily work with incidents and allegations of torture in many different countries and regions around the globe. 
I am especially worried by the recurring attempts to use security concerns to justify the targeted abuse of people. 
Torture is illegal under international law and there are no exceptions. 
It is not limited to physical violence, the deliberate infliction of psychological violence can likewise be a manifestation of torture if it reaches a certain degree of severity. Examples of such torture include sleep deprivation, the threat of force or prolonged periods of isolation. 
That is why Germany has ratified the Convention against Torture and its additional protocol and is one of the biggest donors to the UN Fund for Victims of Torture. 
For example, the Federal Foreign Office funds the work of Dr Margarete Osterfeld, Germany’s member of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. 
The 1984 UN Convention against Torture defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person when such pain or suffering if inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. 
Germany has ratified the Convention against Torture and its additional protocol and is one of the biggest donors to the UN Fund for Victims of Torture. 
The Vienna nuclear agreement – a long-term solution to the conflict surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme 
To this end, it is important that the Vienna agreement be implemented unconditionally. 
The key elements of the Vienna agreement 
Abduction of children 
The Federal Foreign Office and the German missions abroad (embassies and consulates-general) are often asked for help when children are abducted across borders. 
Very often the children are left in the custody of family members living there. 
The rights of (joint) custody of the German parent are regularly infringed in these cases, any decisions already taken regarding rights of custody are ignored and rights of access abused. 
The prerequisite for criminal prosecution is an application by the person whose parental rights have been infringed. 
However, experience shows that measures under criminal law or police action alone only help achieve the desired objective in rare cases. 
In other countries, too, child abduction may be punishable under national law. 
German fathers and mothers can therefore also be guilty of child abduction if they, against the will of the foreign father or the foreign mother or in violation of a decision by a foreign court, return to Germany with the common children. 
The motto of the summit is “Towards a Global Social Contract on Migration and Development”. 
Germany has set the following priorities for the summit: 
Work on an ambitious Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration 
Federal Foreign Office Last updated in 
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (HCCAICA) 
to be adopted in 2018, linking global standards on migration governance with recommendations on concrete goals and a review mechanism.

With its goal of a global social contract, Germany is a fair partner.

“He who would write poetry must write poetry entire. 
The fourteenth volume of the book project “The persecution and murder of European Jews by National Socialist Germany from 1933 to 1945 – Occupied southeast Europe and Italy” appears, at first sight, to be quite matter‑of‑fact and dry with 
Volume 14 contains 312 sources and documents detailing the persecution and murder of Jews in Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Greece and Albania. 
Allow me to take a closer look at an example from the region, one that is particularly important to me, namely the situation of the Jewish community in Thessaloniki, which I have visited on a number of occasions in the past few years. 
The city lost almost 50,000 citizens of Jewish faith in 1943. 
This loss pains all of us, Jews and non‑Jews alike. 
I have enjoyed a close dialogue with the Jewish community in Thessaloniki for almost four years now. 
In January 2014, I was invited to give an address on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day as a member of the Federal Government – at the place from where the Jews of Thessaloniki were deported. 
I have been back to Thessaloniki time and again since then. 
I am particularly delighted that the Jewish community in Thessaloniki is prepared, with the support of the Federal Government, to implement projects to continue to strengthen Jewish life in the city. 
And, first and foremost, Heinz Kunio has told countless school classes about his experiences and continues to meet young people to this day. 
Access to original documents with commentaries by researchers is so important especially in times of increasing radicalisation and the rapid dissemination of so‑called “fake news” and “alternative facts”. 
This is not just a question of shedding light on Germany’s chequered history, but above all of remembering the tragic history of Greece, Italy, Albania and the successor states of the former Yugoslavia. 
All of the trips that I have been on in this region have reminded me about this fact. 
Special regulations in European Union member states (with the exception of Denmark) 
For such a judgement to be enforced, it must also be enforceable in the member state in which it was made. 
It must also have been served properly. 
In the United Kingdom, the judgement must also have been previously registered. 
However, transitional regulations apply. 
For further information, please contact: 
Bundesamt für Justiz (Federal Office of Justice) 
which is available as your point of contact as the Central Authority for implementing this Regulation. 
Other speakers at the opening event will include Gerd Müller, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development; Louise Arbour, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration (SRSG); Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); William Swing, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM); Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO); and David Malone, Rector of the United Nations University. 
On 28 June 2017, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will open the Tenth Summit of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) at the Federal Foreign Office. 
The meeting is the highlight of the first of two years of Germany and Morocco’s co‑chairmanship of the GFMD. 
Launched in 2007 as an initiative of the United Nations Member States, the GFMD is an informal, non‑binding, voluntary and government‑led process at global level in an international framework. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita will open the three‑day conference, which will be attended by representatives of some 140 countries, international organisations, civil society and the private sector. 
The co‑chairmanship with Morocco underlines Germany’s engagement in the field of migration and sustainable development, as well as the German Government’s interest in working closely with Morocco. 
Implementation of Goal 10.7 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on facilitating safe, orderly and regular migration. 
The options of German missions abroad are particularly limited if the children abducted are also nationals of the state in which they are staying. 
The authorities there will then regard and treat the children exclusively as citizens of that country. 
Whether or not the children also have German nationality is completely immaterial. 
This position is taken by all states (including Germany). 
Provision of assistance by the German missions abroad is therefore virtually ruled out and in practice nearly impossible. 
This applies above all in those cases in which abducted children have been taken to an Islamic country. 
Family law and legal practice in Islamic states assigns primary responsibility for children to the father; as a rule, it is also the father who alone determines in which country and with which persons the children are to grow up. 
Even though the Islamic view of the relationship between men and women does not observe the principles governing German family law, it must be respected. 
Efforts by a mother to bring an action for custody of her child in a court in an Islamic country usually have little prospect of success, especially if she is a foreigner and not a Muslim. 
But even winning custody does not necessarily enable the mother to achieve her goal of taking the child back to Germany. 
Should she exceptionally be awarded the right of custody, she might only be able to exercise this right in the foreign country at the father's place of domicile, for in most cases the child may not leave that country without the express consent of the father. 
A German passport or child's identity card does not help to resolve this problem. 
Out-of-court solutions 
In view of the difficulties described above and given the uncertain outcome of court proceedings in a foreign country, a consensual settlement between the parents should be sought if at all possible. 
Decisions of German courts are useless if they cannot be enforced abroad. 
Other states claim the sovereign right to take decisions on their own territory through their own authorities and courts, just as Germany does. 
The majority of such cases occur in the context of binational marriages or partnerships; when the relationship fails or after divorce the foreign father or mother takes one or more of their common children to his/her home country against the will of the German parent or keeps the child or children there after a holiday against the will of the other parent. 
An exception to this requirement can be made inter alia if the law enforcement agencies (public prosecution office) consider it necessary to intervene for special reasons of public interest. 
Such cases are not punishable under German law. 
However, if the state concerned issues an international warrant for the German parent’s arrest, the possibility that a third country will implement this request cannot be ruled out. 
That may then result in an arrest in a third country followed by extradition to the country from which the child was taken. 
Those seeking help may submit enquiries and appeals free of charge via the Federal Office of Justice. 
The Convention retains its validity for the legal areas not covered by the Regulation. 
In states governed by the rule of law and the separation of powers it is not usually possible for the country’s government to interfere with the administration of justice. 
This is the case even if the German mission or the German Government asks that government to help and given the good political relations between the two countries it would like to do so. 
If the situation were reversed, the Federal Foreign Office or the German Government would have no choice but to refer to the independence of the courts. 
After all, a disagreement between a married couple or divorced parents as to who should have custody of their common children is a private (family law) matter, not a foreign policy issue. 
Types of legal proceedings 
As is the case in Germany, the police of a foreign state cannot act solely on the basis of a decision handed down by the court of another country. 
In principle, there are two possible legal options. 
It is wise to discuss these options with a lawyer to determine which is the most promising. 
If a decision has been handed down by a German court concerning the right of custody of a child and the right to determine the child's place of residence, the duly entitled parent can attempt to have this decision recognised and declared enforceable by the court of the country to which the children have been taken. 
Without the successful conclusion of these proceedings, a German court decision is not binding in the foreign country. 
Another option is to bring an action for custody of the children before the competent court in the state to which the children have been taken with the aim of securing their return on the basis of the ruling by the foreign court. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s experience with these options is that both are time-consuming and expensive. 
The local German embassy or consulate abroad may upon request and without obligation furnish addresses of lawyers (many of whom speak German). 
The think tank European Council on Foreign Relations celebrated its tenth anniversary on 26 June. 
The think tank European Council on Foreign Relations celebrated its tenth anniversary on Monday (26 June). 
Court costs and lawyer’s fees cannot be assumed by the Federal Foreign Office or the missions abroad. 
The staff of the German missions abroad are not themselves empowered to represent the interests of German nationals before the courts. 
In most cases the people concerned will need the help of a local lawyer. 
Turning point for Europe 
Central player in the region: visit of Iranian Foreign Minister 
2017, the tenth anniversary of the European Council on Foreign Relations, could be a turning point said Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
On Tuesday (27 June) Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his counterpart Javad Zarif to discuss the many conflicts in the Middle East. 
The situation in the region is highly complex: 
the Qatar crisis, a humanitarian disaster in Yemen and the Syria conflict. 
This makes it all the more crucial to seek to engage in dialogue with Iran. 
It was also an opportunity for the German Foreign Minister to call upon Iran to adopt a constructive stance to help defuse the crises in the region. 
During the meeting Gabriel once again stressed that Israel’s right to exist is non-negotiable.

“A glimmer of hope in the world” 
The elections in Austria and the Netherlands had shown that populists could not take Europe by storm after all. 
Furthermore, the election of Emmanuel Macron in France confirmed that people on the European continent still believed in the EU as a guarantor for a better future. 
“Since the nuclear agreement in 2015, a historic window of opportunity has opened”, Gabriel declared. 
That is evidenced in many ways: 
political contacts are more intensive than they have been for a long time. 
Visits and trips have increased significantly. 
Economic and cultural contacts have intensified. 
“Europe is back!” 
The nuclear agreement has led to improved relations. 
Gabriel regards the agreement of 2015 as “a glimmer of hope in the world”. 
He said that it was proof that the threat of a military confrontation could be prevented by diplomatic negotiations. 
First and foremost, this was about political and social cohesion. 
Both foreign ministers praised the success in implementing the agreement and appealed 
to all parties to continue to comply with all obligations set down in the nuclear deal.

Diplomacy rather than escalation 
a long-term solution to the conflict surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme Relations with Germany 
Direct talks involving all participants would also be desirable in connection with the current situation in the region, not least so that the blockade on Qatar could be removed. 
“The longer the crisis surrounding Qatar lasts, the deeper and stronger the lines of conflict will become,” Foreign Minister Gabriel warned after the meeting with his opposite number. 
He therefore appealed to all parties not to fuel the conflict any further and exacerbate the crisis. 
“Further escalation is not in the interests of any of the parties.” 
Iran is a central player in the Middle East. Gabriel therefore issued the following warning with regard to the other conflicts in the region: 
“Iran needs to adopt a constructive role, as do the region’s neighbours.” 
Any assistance claimed must be repaid. 
The Regulation has dispensed with the proceedings for the issue of a declaration of enforceability for certain decisions on rights of access and certain decisions ordering the return of the child. 
This is conditional on the courts issuing documentation as evidence of compliance with certain minimum procedural standards in connection with their decisions.

The negative outcome of national referenda concerning a European constitution, the financial and debt crisis, the tense security situation at European borders and the flows of refugees in recent times had led to scepticism towards the EU and boosted populist and nationalistic movements. 
Moreover, following years of sluggish growth the economic situation had improved in almost all member states, investment was picking up and unemployment was going down. 
“We can see a strong momentum”, said Gabriel: 
He went on to say that this momentum must now be turned into a sustainable dynamic: 
“We have to seize this European moment!” 
In concrete terms, the reform of the eurozone had to be tackled in order to prevent an ever growing divergence among the European economies. 
In Gabriel’s view, various regions should be the focus of special attention: in the countries of the Western Balkans, the cooperation in the spheres of infrastructure and energy had to be expanded. In countries such as Libya, Mali and Niger, too, Gabriel believes that the EU has to be more engaged in view of refugee issues and migration. 
Finding a united European voice 
Finally, this was also about the role of the EU in the international order, stated Gabriel.

While 15 years ago, “ever closer union” was the stated goal of the European Union, since then a series of crises had jeopardised European integration. 
Nevertheless, Gabriel went on to say, there was now some room for optimism. 
To do this, Europe first of all had to be strengthened from within, Gabriel stressed. 
Moreover, basic social security systems were needed in all member states and efforts should be made everywhere to introduce a minimum wage. 
Currently, the established global cooperation was changing and formerly close partners such as the United States had to be convinced that they should continue cooperating closely. 
Furthermore, individual countries and regions had to be supported in their fight against youth unemployment, for example through targeted investment in vocational training, infrastructure and digital projects. 
In the outside world, too, Europe had to play a more prominent part, added Gabriel. The role of the European Security and Defence Policy should be strengthened. 
Sigmar Gabriel stated that in future the EU’s voice would only be heard on the international stage if it was a united European voice.

The underground plant in Fordow will no longer be used for enrichment. 
I’m flying to Russia today to open the German-Russian town-twinning conference in Krasnodar together with my counterpart Sergey Lavrov. 
On this occasion Foreign Minister Gabriel called for European cohesion to be enhanced, the European Security and Defence Policy to be strengthened and Europe’s role within the international order to be redefined. 
We will only be able to overcome the major international conflicts of our times if we work together in a spirit of mutual trust. 
In spite of all our political differences, we should not forget how close and varied relations between Russians and Germans have become since the end of the Cold War. 
The twinning arrangements between our towns and regions play a crucial role in this regard. 
Germany and Russia: bilateral relations 
We have to keep talking to each other, even at times that are politically difficult. 
It’s the only way of maintaining trust. It’s the only way of solving problems peaceably. 
We have every interest in further expanding this kind of interaction between our societies.

Representatives of the E3/EU+3 and Iran meet once every quarter in the Joint Commission, 
which is chaired by the Secretary-General of the European External Action Service and where they discuss the implementation and interpretation of the Vienna agreement. 
It uses the strictest monitoring regime in the world and has been able to confirm so far that Iran is adhering to its undertakings. 
In 2016, the EU’s trade volume with Iran increased by 79 percent compared with 2015 to approximately 13.7 billion euros. 
The meeting was chaired by the two Economics Affairs Ministers and led to a large number of agreements on German investments in Iran.

In signing the Vienna agreement of 14 July 2015, the E3/EU+3 countries and Iran reached consensus on a long-term settlement of the nuclear dispute, following more than 12 years of contention. 
In signing the Vienna agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – JCPoA) of 14 July 2015, the E3/EU+3 countries (China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, the US and the EU) and Iran reached consensus on a long-term settlement of the nuclear dispute, following more than 12 years of contention.

Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling to Krasnodar, Russia, today (28 June) to launch the German-Russian year of municipal and regional partnerships 2017/18. 
The IAEA has been able to confirm in its reports so far that Iran is fulfilling its obligations. 
According to estimates, Iran’s economy grew by approximately seven percent in 2016, while German exports to Iran rose by around 25 percent. 
The easing of the sanctions has also had a positive impact.

Despite these positive developments, however, it is obvious that the E3/EU+3 and Iran are only at the start of a long phase of mutual confidence-building. 
The German Foreign Minister will see for himself how close and diverse Russian-German relations are tomorrow when 80 enthusiastic football fans from Germany and Russia convene for a street football tournament for tolerance. 
A conference of German ambassadors in Eurasia took place at the Federal Foreign Office on 22 and 23 June. 
Cooperation in Eurasia 
Not only German embassies in the region want to work together more closely in future. 
Creating trust and overcoming conflicts 
The initiative is an extensive political and economic programme in the region. 
China is moving closer to Europe through large-scale investment in the field of transport and connectivity. 
It is thanks to dialogue and exchange on a wide range of bilateral levels that it is only on the football pitch that Germany and Russia are opponents today. 
Safeguarding free trade, complying with social and environmental norms 
On the historical Silk Road: Dunhuang, an oasis city in western China 
In Germany’s view, the guarantee of free trade and compliance with global social and environmental norms are of particular importance. 
Among other things, it dismantled two-thirds of its centrifuges, exported almost all of its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia and filled the core of the plutonium reactor in Arak with cement, thus rendering it unusable. 
“Eurasian connectivity” – this was the motto of the meeting of 25 heads of German missions from a region covering China, Iran, the Baltic states and the Balkans, which was held on Thursday (22 June) to discuss stronger cooperation in Eurasia. 
Germany contributed particular expertise, especially on transparency, technological restrictions and the design of the procurement channel and set important priorities with the E3/EU+3 partners. 
In return for Iran scaling back its nuclear programme, the UN, EU and extraterritorial US economic and financial sanctions against the nuclear programme were lifted on Implementation Day, as laid down in the JCPoA. 
Offers of economic cooperation are being made in particular to Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to the states in Central Asia and the Caucasus. 
However, the bilateral embargo by the US against Iran (with the exception of aircraft, food and carpets) and the UN, EU and US’ lists of individuals and entities sanctioned for supporting terrorism and violating human rights remain in force. 
Should Iran breach the agreement, the lifted UN sanctions can be reimposed quickly and easily, 
without the need for a UN Security Council resolution. 
In order to build confidence, it remains crucial that the IAEA continue its detailed verification and that the Joint Commission carry on its constructive dialogue in the future. 
Some 18 months after the start of the implementation phase, significant progress has been made. 
Iran significantly scaled back its nuclear programme as a prerequisite for sanctions being eased on Implementation Day on 16 January 2016. 
Since then, Iran has only been allowed to use 5060 first-generation centrifuges in the Natanz plant to enrich uranium for the next ten years. 
It has agreed to restrict its uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent and to limit its stockpile of enriched material (uranium hexafluoride) in the country to 300 kilograms for 15 years. 
To date, the German Government has provided 4.1 million euros to the IAEA to verify the Vienna agreement of July 2015 (and previously to verify the Geneva Joint Plan of Action of November 2013). 
Such approval is given when the country’s application has met the Procurement Channel requirements. 
The E3/EU+3 and Iranian Joint Commission Procurement Working Group reviews incoming export applications and makes recommendations on them to the Security Council. 
This goes to show that, irrespective of the political situation, there are close ties between our two peoples. 
Prior to the town-twinning conference, which is to be opened in the evening by Sigmar Gabriel and his counterpart Sergey Lavrov, the two Foreign Ministers declared that “municipal and regional partnerships are an indispensable and fundamental component of Russia and Germany’s bilateral cooperation. 
We need a constructive Russia – in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, and likewise in eastern Ukraine. 
A few days later, on 20 July 2015, the United Nations Security Council endorsed the Vienna agreement via Resolution 2231 (2015). 
Economic achievements include estimated economic growth of approximately seven percent (for the Iranian fiscal year from 21 March 2016 to 20 March 2017) and reaching the pre-sanctions level of oil production of some four million barrels. 
Germany alone exported goods worth around 2.6 billion euros to Iran in 2016, an increase of 25 percent over the same period in 2015. 
On 12 January 2017, Airbus delivered the first of a total of 100 aircraft to the state-run airline Iran Air. 
“We will only be able to overcome the major international conflicts of our times if we work together in a spirit of mutual trust,” said the German Foreign Minister prior to departure. 
The conference held on 22 and 23 June focused on the expansion of regional cooperation. China’s New Silk Road Initiative was also on the agenda. 
The conference focused on the expansion of regional cooperation. China’s Silk Road Initiative was also on the agenda. 
State Secretary Ederer opened the Eurasian Ambassadors Conference at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Precisely 60 years ago, against the backdrop of a highly tense political situation, the cities of Hamburg and Leningrad sent a courageous signal. Despite the German blockade of Leningrad, which was still fresh in people’s memories, and the tensions of the Cold War, the two port cities established the first town-twinning partnership between Russia and Germany in 1957. 
“The area covered by China’s Silk Road is just as momentously important to us Europeans as it is to China”, said State Secretary Markus Ederer at the opening of the conference – the German response to the Chinese initiative was therefore a key issue at the meeting. 
With its New Silk Road Initiative – also known as the One Belt, One Road Initiative – China, too, is seeking greater cooperation in Eurasia.

In the course of the two-day debate with representatives of the European External Action Service (EAD), the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) as well as representatives from the academic world and the business community, it was agreed that China's integration efforts in Eurasia should be followed with interest but, at the same time, critically. 
Coordination within Europe on issues related to Eurasian connectivity and cooperation in and with the Central Asian region are also necessary. 
Since 2002, the Center for International Peace Operations (ZIF) has played a key role in the secondment of German experts. 
In his speech, Roth said:

73 peace missions around the world 
Around the globe, there are currently 11 major conflicts that claim more than 1000 lives per year – as well as numerous smaller conflicts. 
Because Germany’s foreign policy is first and foremost peace policy, actively contributing to these peace missions is a chief priority of German diplomacy. 
Experts more urgently needed than ever 
Thanking the German Bundestag 
15th anniversary of the Center for International Peace Operations 
Roth also thanked all parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag for their support and emphasised how important the revised Secondment Act is for the seconded experts themselves: 
Speech by Minister of State Michael Roth on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Center for International Peace Operations (27 June 2017) 
73 peace missions are responding, working first to contain them and later to keep the peace. 
Germany provides financial support – for example, as the fourth-largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget. 
However, Germany’s engagement also includes seconding German experts to these same peace missions. 
Isolationism is not a solution 
Foreign Minister Gabriel calls for a new global attitude towards migration. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel talking about migration 
Foreign Minister Gabriel has called for a fundamental rethink in worldwide migration policy. 
“No country can isolate themselves forever. 
In his address, Minister of State Roth praised ZIF as an important part of Germany’s modern peace diplomacy. 
Speaking at the event marking the anniversary on Tuesday (21 June), Minister of State Michael Roth praised ZIF as an important part of Germany’s modern peace diplomacy. 
“If ZIF didn't exist, we would have to invent it today.” 
With a staff of 50, ZIF is responsible for seconding experts to, and qualifying them for, peace missions. It also draws up analyses and concept papers on peacebuilding and peacekeeping. 
Some 150 experts, so-called secondees, are currently serving in the field via ZIF. They are deployed on, among others, OSCE, EU, UN and NATO missions. 
In his speech, Minister of State Michael Roth paid tribute to the role played by ZIF: 
This worldwide social contract seeks to facilitate a fair balancing of interests between migrants and their countries of origin and destination. 
Immigration as an opportunity 
Global Forum on Migration and Development 
Representatives from 140 counties met at the Global Forum on Migration and Development. 
It has recently been expanded into a full sending organisation, and the revised Secondment Act has created a solid legal basis for its activities. 
Germany and Morocco assumed the co-chairmanship of the body in 2017 for a two-year term. 
The decline in the birth rate, which has continued for decades now, is a cause for concern for strong economies such as Germany. 
Legal migration options and cooperation with repatriations 
Representatives from 140 countries met in Berlin on Wednesday (28 June) at the Global Forum on Migration and Development. 
This is an illusion that is being propagated by nationalists”, said Gabriel. 
Achieving a fair balancing of interests 
The GFMD is an initiative of the member states of the United Nations and was established in 2007. 
Without migration, it will not be possible to meet labour force demand in the future. 
A more open migration policy was indispensable for this, he said. 
“Legal immigration opportunities must be created in order to counteract illegal migration”, said Gabriel. 
Only with transparent migration options and legal immigration opportunities would it be possible to prevent people from having to put their fate into the hands of human traffickers. 
He said that not only countries of origin, but also countries of transit and destination would need to reassess their migration policies. 
“What we need in order to make a success of migration policy are not only bans, but also regulations that allow us to use migration as an opportunity”, said Gabriel. 
The Foreign Minister added that this was not just a question of taking moral responsibility for people in need, but was also in the economic interests of the majority of countries of destination. 
Gabriel emphasised that human trafficking rings that unscrupulously exploit people’s hardship must be stopped. 
Moreover, he pointed out, incentives could be created for countries of origin, also with regard to the repatriation of rejected asylum-seekers. 
I am shocked by the further worsening of the already dramatic humanitarian situation in Yemen. 
children, the elderly and the poor. 
The civilian population is bearing the brunt of the suffering. 
The most important steps to this end are an immediate ceasefire, unrestricted and secure humanitarian access and the resumption of negotiations brokered by the United Nations. 
Infringements of international humanitarian law must be investigated quickly and thoroughly. 
If your child has been taken to a Contracting State to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the Federal Office of Justice can help. 
Find out more Repatriation of a child from an HCCAICA Contracting State 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic has already claimed in excess of 1400 lives. 
There are 220,000 suspected cases. 
The object of the Convention is to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State. 
In the case of child abductions to one of the Contracting States, you are urgently recommended to contact the Federal Office of Justice immediately. 
You can also obtain advice on child abduction in an HCCAICA Contracting State and on cross-border access and custody conflicts from the Central Contact Point for Cross-border Family Conflicts at the International Social Service, German Branch (ISS): 
“A just world with just migration will not come about if more and more walls and fences are built”, said Gabriel at the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) on Wednesday (28 June). 
High-ranking representatives from some 140 countries met to discuss the Global Compact on Migration at the Global Forum on Migration and Development under the chairmanship of Germany and Morocco. 
I had already communicated to my Turkish colleague weeks ago that we do not believe this is a good idea. 
The decision is in the hands of the courts. 
In cases of international child abduction, the Federal Foreign Office and the German missions abroad have no legal means and in practice only very limited real means of helping secure the abducted child's return to Germany. 
Issues relating to custody and the child's place of residence are decided by the judiciary, i.e. the courts, in all countries of the world. 
We have a common position on this within the Federal Government. 
We will even go a step further. 
That also applies to arrangements concerning rights of access. 
Foreign law regulates many things differently than German law. 
In the past, we have agreed to such public appearances, also during election campaigns. 
An independent international commission of inquiry is the most effective tool in this regard. 
and there is a threat of famine. 
The current cholera outbreak has further exacerbated the situation since April. 
It is the Federal Foreign Office’s view that this should no longer be permitted. 
The Federal Foreign Office has increased humanitarian assistance for the country in 2017 to 125 million euros. 
The decision is in the hands of the courts. 
of helping secure the abducted child's return to Germany. 
While humanitarian workers are attempting to do their job at great risk to life and limb, aid is not reaching many areas owing to restricted access and administrative barriers. 
Of course, President Erdogan is an important guest at the G20 Summit, and we will welcome him with full honours. 
All those who live in our midst, regardless of whether they are German citizens or not, are part of our country. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the worsening of the crisis in Yemen 
The Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, issued the following statement today (29 June) on the occasion of today’s event in Berlin entitled “Crisis in Yemen: politics and humanitarian assistance in the context of media restraint” hosted by the German branch of the International Rescue Committee. 
The war that has raged for over two years has inflicted a man-made humanitarian disaster upon this impoverished nation that has hit the weakest first – 
The current cholera epidemic with around 5000 new suspected cases every day is exacerbating the crisis in the country still further. 
We are greatly concerned by the fact that hostilities are claiming civilian casualties time and again. The attack on a market in Sadaa province on 18 June 2017, which claimed over 20 lives, is a case in point. 
Furthermore, more and more reports are detailing increasing repression and restrictions to fundamental civil and basic liberties by all parties to the conflict. 
Only a political solution can put an end to this man-made crisis. 
According to the United Nations, one of the world’s most serious humanitarian crises is taking place in Yemen. 
Furthermore, Germany is funding the Track II dialogue of the Berghof Foundation, currently the only inclusive intra-Yemeni dialogue format to support the UN’s mediation efforts. 
Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Bärbel Kofler is patron of the #nichtvergessen (don’t forget) initiative, launched by the Federal Foreign Office together with several aid organisations. Thus aims to draw more attention to crises such as the one in Yemen. 
The abduction of minors is punishable pursuant to section 235 of the German Criminal Code. 
Repatriation of a child from an HCCAICA Contracting State 
In order to return abducted children as quickly as possible, more than 80 states have now joined the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980. 
Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 (Brussels IIA Regulation), which has been in force since 1 March 2005, replacing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000, all decisions on parental responsibility including measures to protect the child, regardless of whether there is any link with a matrimonial proceeding or whether the children belong to both spouses, shall be automatically recognised in the other EU member states (with the exception of Denmark) without the need for a special recognition procedure. 
Such decisions may be enforced without a prior declaration of enforceability in other EU member states (with the exception of Denmark). 
The Regulation takes precedence over the above-mentioned Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980 insofar as it governs areas covered by the Regulation, such as matters concerning recognition, enforcement and competence. 
The Regulation is also valid in the new EU member states. 
In cases of international child abduction, the Federal Foreign Office and the German missions abroad have no legal means and in practice only very limited real means 
1st option 
2nd option 
To enable the swift return of abducted children to Germany, in emergencies the missions abroad may grant financial assistance for the return journey if the parent concerned cannot raise the necessary funds at short notice (subsidiarity principle in public assistance pursuant to section 5 of the Consular Law). 
Mutual agreement is better 
Only if the father has grossly neglected his duties – by failing to take care of his child, for instance – does the mother have a slightly better chance in some Islamic states. 
Careful consideration must be given to the question of whether time-consuming and costly recourse to the courts is simpler than a meeting of the parents – if necessary with the participation of persons in a position of trust or counselling services – during which both, notwithstanding their personal differences, let themselves be guided by the best interests of the common children. 
Legal positions – no matter how clear they may be from a German standpoint – are often irrelevant for all practical purposes. 
Dialogue event on Hungary with Minister of State Michael Roth 
Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, spoke about controversial current developments in Hungary at a panel discussion on 27 June. 
The event, Shared European Values? German-Hungarian Dialogue, was organised by the Federal Foreign Office and the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung. 
Germany will continue to support you in this task.

Topics for discussion: NGO Act and refugee policy 
The International Organization for Migration is a key partner for us in this regard. 
Allow me to thank you and your staff for your great dedication in this difficult field. 
An amendment to the University Act poses a threat to the future of the Central European University and to academic freedom in Hungary. 
A new NGO Act stipulates that Hungarian non-governmental organisations must declare funding from abroad. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on public appearances in Germany by President Erdogan of Turkey 
Speaking on the margins of his visit to Krasnodar, Russia, Foreign Minister Gabriel made the following comment today (29 June) regarding an official request by Turkey that President Erdogan be permitted to address the the public in Germany: 
As we will be hosting the G20 Summit, we will not have sufficient police officers available to provide the necessary security. 
I also openly stated that such a public appearance would neither be appropriate nor politically apposite, given the current tensions that exist with Turkey. 
I therefore very much understand the comments that have been made by Martin Schulz. 
I think we should now tell all countries that are not EU members – not only Turkey – that we will not permit campaign appearances here that are intended to import another country’s internal conflicts into Germany. 
“It’s normal to discuss difficult topics” 
I assume the Federal Chancellor will also think this is the right approach. 
Allow me to thank you and your staff for your dedication in this difficult field. 
After the event, Minister of State Roth said: 
“It was good that we spoke with one another today. 
I do not, however, believe that anything beyond that would be appropriate at this point in time. 
We do not want these people to be subjected to demagoguery in connection with conflicts in their homeland. 
Incomprehension does not however mean that we are at a loss for words. 
I have proposed to the Federal Chancellor that we reassess our policy. 
We consider the Turks who live in Germany to be fellow members of our society. 
We have received an official request from Turkey that President Erdogan be permitted to address his compatriots in Germany on the sidelines of the G20 Summit. 
Mr Othman Belbeisi Chief of Mission International Organization for Migration Tripoli 
The European Union is a community of shared values, which can only function if all of us resolutely uphold and defend those values.

The panel also included Zsolt Enyedi, Pro-Rector of the Central European University, and Márta Pardavi, Co-Chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. 
German-Hungarian dialogue – Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, discussed current developments in Hungary. 
European partners struggle to understand many of the current developments in Hungary. 
While Hungary underlines its contribution to security in Europe through its protection of the EU’s outer borders, NGOs take a critical view of the country’s asylum procedure with regard to the European legal framework and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 
I don’t want to hide the fact that we unfortunately cannot understand much of what is happening in Hungary. 
For example, calls for homogeneous societies are incompatible with the fundamental principles of our EU treaties. 
And most importantly, we must finally give up believing the myth that all good things come from European capitals alone, while all bad things come from an allegedly vast bureaucracy in Brussels. 
Peter Györkös, Hungarian Ambassador to Germany, and Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, spoke in Berlin on 27 June about current developments in Hungary that are causing particular concern in Germany and Europe. 
There is also much to discuss as regards Hungary’s refugee policy. 
What we need in Europe is more team spirit and greater commitment to what we have in common.” 
That is why it is completely normal for European partners to discuss difficult topics. 
Dear Mr Belbeisi, 
The visit that you helped to organise impressed me deeply and offered me an insight into the catastrophic living conditions of the people held at the detention centre. 
We must continue to work together to improve the situation of refugees and migrants in Libya. 
Dear Ms Rubaian, 
We must work together to improve the situation of refugees and migrants in Libya. 
Permit me to thank you most sincerely for preparing my visit to the Tariq Al Sekka detention centre on 8 June and for accompanying me on this occasion. 
The Federal Foreign Office sent the following circular note today (30 June) to the embassies accredited in Germany: 
Circular note on election rallies by foreign politicians in Germany 
Appearances by foreign politicians at events in Germany that are aimed at the electorate of the foreign country require the approval of the German Government. 
They may not pose a threat to public security and order. 
As a general rule, approval is not granted if the speech is to be given in a period of less than three months before the date of the election or referendum; this rule does not apply to European Union Member States. 
Such approval must be requested via a Note Verbale to the Federal Foreign Office at least ten days before the event. 
Approval will be granted in the light of foreign relations; it thus does not replace the necessary permits under the law of public order. 
Appearances must comply with the principles of the Basic Law and the German legal system, particularly as regards the right of assembly. 
From 1 July to 31 December 2017, Estonia will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. 
Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the opening of the Global Forum on Migration and Development 
Colleagues and fellow ministers, Ladies and gentlemen, 
Welcome to Berlin! Welcome to the Global Forum on Migration and Development! 
I was saddened to learn of the death of Simone Veil. 
Her life was a symbol of the reconciliation between the French and Germans after the Second World War and an example for us all. 
She was passionate about European integration. 
As the first female President of the European Parliament, she stood up resolutely for the rights of the first freely and directly elected representation of all the peoples of Europe united in the European Community. 
I share the grief of my French friends and have the utmost respect for the life lived by Simone Veil. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (30 June) on the death of French politician Simone Veil: 
Simone Veil was a bastion of Franco-German friendship. 
And I am particularly delighted that we, Germany, are co-hosting the Global Forum on Migration and Development with Morocco. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the death of French politician Simone Veil 
Although she was arrested by the Gestapo in 1944, separated from her family and deported to a concentration camp, Simone Veil forgave the Germans and fought for European integration. 
Franco-German friendship would not have been possible without courageous and magnanimous people such as Simone Veil. 
She made ground-breaking achievements in the field of women’s rights in France. 
She was often the first of her kind: the first female President of the European Parliament, one of the first female ministers in the French Government and the first woman to be awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen.

Gabriel’s third visit to Russia 
He then went on to visit the Russian capital. 
They stressed the importance of more intensive dialogue, particularly in politically difficult times. 
“International understanding from the bottom up” 
During a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart, the German Foreign Minister described this as “international understanding from the bottom up”. 
We most strongly condemn the employment of chemical weapons in Syria, which has now been proven beyond a doubt. 
That Germany and Russia only faced each other as opponents on the football pitch was not always the case. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel visits the Russian State Archive 
Talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (30 June) on the publication of a report by the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on the plausibility of a chemical weapons attack in Syria: 
Gabriel said that the major international conflicts of our times could only be overcome by working together in a spirit of mutual trust. 
We mustn’t expect crisis zones to become stable democracies overnight. 
“We need a constructive Russia – in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, and likewise in eastern Ukraine.” The Foreign Minister also made this clear during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
He is the first high-ranking Western politician to travel to the region since the start of the Qatar crisis: 
In Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, he intends to call on the parties to the conflict to show a readiness to compromise. 
Dispute among brothers 
Sigmar Gabriel departing for the Gulf region 
In a region already stricken by tensions, instability, crises, failing states and war, a dispute broke out a few weeks ago among the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. 
“The comprehensive, thoroughly researched report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) draws the clear conclusion that sarin was used on 4 April in Khan Sheikhoun. 
“We are concerned that mistrust and discord could ultimately weaken all sides and the Gulf Peninsula as a whole.” 
“The conflict affects us too.” 
Working together to foster fair competition – EU fines Google 
The European Commission has fined US internet concern Google. 
Civil society initiatives such as youth exchange programmes and town twinning projects are ideal opportunities for bilateral cooperation, in addition to political dialogue. 
This clearly proves all those wrong who claimed that sarin was never used in Khan Sheikhoun. 
Anyone who uses chemical weapons needs to be fully aware that the international community does not tolerate the use of these banned weapons, and that those who are responsible will be held accountable. 
Cooperation is better than confrontation 
Fine of billions for distorting competition 
During a visit to the company Claas, a manufacturer of agricultural machines based in Krasnodar, Gabriel recognised the potential contained in relations between the two countries. 
Ahead of his trip he stressed: 
That is not only relevant for business. 
We are not taking anyone’s part. 
involving 80 football fans from Germany and Russia who gathered to play against one another. 
As a next step, it is important to swiftly identify the individuals who were responsible for this barbaric crime. 
“What is needed now is an earnest dialogue among everyone involved with a view to finding constructive solutions through negotiation.” 
He added that this was the only way it would be possible to resume political talks at some point. 
‎Determined efforts to combat terrorism 
“Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results and demoting those of competitors,” said Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition. 
From Krasnodar to Moscow: 
In this spirit, the Foreign Minister attended a street football tournament for tolerance, 
Limited choice for consumers 
Furthermore, concrete and practicable responses are needed to the complaints among the parties to the conflict. 
This applies all the more when it comes to the financing of terrorism. 
He said that the widespread ceasefire during harvest time in eastern Ukraine should be used to work at political level towards establishing a permanent ceasefire. 
“What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. 
And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.” 
Sigmar Gabriel therefore stressed: 
If better mechanisms for this can be developed, then this crisis could even ultimately strengthen our instruments in the fight against terrorism. 
We believe the United Nations Security Council has a special obligation to ensure that this happens.

Since early June, Qatar has been isolated by its neighbours, which are accusing the Emirate of, among other things, financing terrorism. 
The German Foreign Minister stated before departing: 
In the coming three days, Gabriel therefore wants to gain a comprehensive and nuanced insight into the situation in the region. 
In order to tackle conduct that distorts free competition, the European Commission can inspect companies, reject projects or hand down fines. 
The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition thus protects European consumers. 
The European Commission also works bilaterally or multilaterally with competition authorities in third countries. 
In several bilateral talks with representatives of the governments in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, he will call for efforts to ease the acute tension. 
I am delighted that so many international guests have come here, including some with whom we have recently enjoyed close cooperation on many aspects of refugee and migration issues. 
The containment of the conflict will require understanding on all sides for the concerns of the others and a readiness to compromise. 
Institutions and legal basis 
and is now approaching its 40th anniversary. 
On 28 June, Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to Krasnodar, Russia, for the town‑twinning conference and launched the German-Russian year of municipal and regional partnerships 2017/18. 
“We are united by a common desire to increase the number and intensity of direct contacts between Russians and Germans through the numerous municipal and regional partnerships, thereby strengthening dialogue and understanding between our societies.” 
Gabriel declared, “The horrors of the Nazi dictatorship and the Cold War warn us to cultivate our bilateral relations even in difficult times.” 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with his Russian colleague Lavrov 
There are now almost 100 town‑twinning projects between Germany and Russia. 
Precisely 60 years ago, against the backdrop of a highly tense political situation, the cities of Hamburg and Leningrad sent a courageous signal. Despite the German blockade of what was then Leningrad, which was still fresh in people’s memories, and the tensions of the Cold War, the two port cities established the first town‑twinning partnership between Russia and Germany in 1957. 
Prior to the town‑twinning conference, the two Foreign Ministers Sigmar Gabriel and Sergey Lavrov declared that municipal and regional partnerships were an indispensable and fundamental component of Russia and Germany’s bilateral cooperation. 
Gabriel at the German‑Russian street football tournament 
On the second day of his trip, the German Foreign Minister was able to gain a first-hand impression of the closeness and diversity of German‑Russian relations. 
German‑Russian ties also exist in the areas of culture and sport. 
In the Russian State Archive of Socio‑Political History in Moscow, the Foreign Minister found accounts of the darkest chapter of recent German‑Russian history.

historical responsibility” (article of 4 June 2017) 
Following a lengthy investigation, the European Commission has ruled that Google is in breach of the European Union’s antitrust laws as a result of this shopping service. 
The company now has to pay a fine of 2.42 billion euros – more than twice the highest fine handed down so far in competition matters. 
In setting the amount of the fine, the European Commission took into account the duration and severity of the infringement. 
Otherwise, it can face penalty payments of up to five percent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company. 
It uses this practice in 13 European Economic Area (EEA) countries, including Germany. 
The original complaint against Google that led to the investigation being launched came from a UK internet company. 
It does not differentiate between European and non-European companies – their activity on the European single market is what counts. 
The Federal Government wishes to thank the OPCW for its thorough and professional investigation.” 
Sadly, it has therefore been substantiated that the use of an internationally banned nerve gas killed approximately 100 people and injured at least 200. 
The OPCW‑UN Joint Investigative Mechanism will now begin to look into who was responsible for this event. 
Should this investigation conclude – as all evidence seems to suggest – that the Syrian regime is to blame for the use of sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, then this would be a new, flagrant and most severe violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Syria is a member. 
what we have actually been doing in the past 40 years. 
I remember the words of an Indian Food Minister who once said to us Europeans: 
This includes fostering the rule of law. 
For one thing is clear: 
Yet the warning that we need a different approach to dealing with prosperity in the world – today we would say that globalisation should not mean wealth for the few but prosperity for all – that warning is not new but has been an issue for the international community for many decades. 
our efforts to create a better migration policy cannot stop at our own borders. 
No country can isolate itself forever. 
That is an illusion that nationalists of all shades keep propagating. 
We therefore need to actively conduct this debate. 
It denied other companies the chance to compete on their merits and to innovate. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the conviction of a Vietnamese blogger 
Of course, the interests of other countries are shaped by quite different realities. 
Countries of transit and origin naturally have a different view of migration and its consequences. 
That is why it is so important for us to tackle this issue together. 
To develop an even better common understanding and draw concrete conclusions. 
These regulations should unite the needs of migrants, first and foremost, as well as their countries of origin and of destination. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel sets off today (3 July) on a three‑day trip to the Arabian Peninsula. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel to the German Bundestag on the debate on the German Government’s guidelines on crisis prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding 
The call for more regulations for migration stems from the simple realisation 
Migration should not be portrayed as a one-way street. 
However, I believe you all know that it actually concerns the very concrete fate of people caught up in wars and conflicts, people who are quite literally struggling to survive. 
After lengthy debates and consultations – not only in Parliament but also in civil society – we adopted German Government’s guidelines entitled “Preventing crises, managing conflicts, building peace”. 
There have never been so many refugees and displaced persons: 65 million people at the close of last year. 
When we look at what’s happening in northern Uganda and in the heart of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, far away from the public eye, we see that sadly there is a very real danger that another record high will be reached this year. 
Ms Quynh spoke out against social injustice and corruption. 
I heard the actual figure today: 20,000 refugees within just a few days. 
I believe the first message to Europe must be: 
The case shows that as a community of over 500 million people and the largest market in the world, it is possible to take resolute action against global concerns. 
The idea of price-comparison services is to help consumers find the cheapest and most suitable offer on the market. 
we cannot leave our friends and partners in Italy in the lurch. 
I am well aware that this is a complex task. 
That is why conferences like this are so crucial. 
Ladies and gentlemen, islands of security and freedom are becoming ever smaller in this world. 
The number of countries in which tensions, violence, war and displacement are part and parcel of daily life, on the other hand, is rising. 
But also partnerships with civil society and the private sector. 
That is why I am so pleased that all of you have accepted our invitation to come here today. 
Without civic engagement and greater transparency, the aim of truly modernising the country cannot be achieved. 
That, for example, is the lesson we learned from our experiences in Rwanda a few years ago when the world stood by because it lacked the will to intervene. 
I hope she will be acquitted in a court of appeal. 
However, another lesson we’ve learned during the last few decades – and it’s mainly military personnel who tell us this – is that 
I am shocked by the conviction of the blogger and activist Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh and her sentencing to ten years’ imprisonment. 
However, the conflict in the Gulf not only concerns whose involved in this dispute but also affects us and our interests. 
She was declared 2015 Civil Rights Defender of the Year by the eponymous Swedish NGO. 
Following her arrest, she was presented in absentia with the International Women of Courage Award by Melania Trump in March 2017. 
They tell us that only with this combination, with such missions, can stability and durable peace be attained. 
In her posts, Quynh focuses on social problems, government mismanagement, environmental pollution, and detention conditions. 
For a just world with just migration will not come about if more and more walls and fences are built. 
if we really want to establish a fair migration system, we first need to clarify what actually lies at the heart of migration. 
At its heart is, firstly, an individual and not a state decision. 
I believe that’s a good message at a time when all over the world we tend to talk more about rearmament and conflicts. 
People make a decision to leave their country of birth, their homeland, and to put down roots elsewhere. 
Secondly, these guidelines are based on the realisation that intelligent political strategies are needed, as are efficient and effective instruments, and above all realistic goals. 
And despite all our optimism and determination, we have to realise that achieving peace isn’t an exact science. 
The company has to pay 2.42 billion euros to the EU for abusing its market dominance and favouring its own price‑comparison service Google Shopping. 
Google has had its own price-comparison service, Google Shopping, on the market since 2004. 
Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition 
The company now has 90 days to end the conduct. 
Since 2008, she said, Google has systematically given prominent placement to its own service in its search engine and demoted rival shopping services. 
The European Commission represents over 500 million people in 28 countries. It is thus easier for the EU to defend its position against one of the largest companies in the world than it would be for individual countries. 
An entire Directorate‑General in Brussels ensures that the rules on fair competition are kept on the single market. 
The Directorate‑General for Competition is also responsible for inspecting monopolies, prosecuting unfair arrangements such as price agreements or the dividing‑up of markets, and monitoring the privatisation of state monopolies and company mergers. 
It’s important that we don’t allow ourselves to be discouraged by setbacks. 
So we are dealing with millions of individual decisions, individual destinies and hopes for a better future. 
Rather, they should spur us on to explore – systematically and with circumspection – how Germany can make a long-term contribution towards more peace and security. 
Allow me to also comment on the very difficult issue of arms exports. 
It makes me sad to think how this sentence will affect Ms Quynh and her two underage children. 
Frank Schwabe, a Member of the German Bundestag, is campaigning for Ms Quynh’s release as part of the programme “Parliamentarians protect Parliamentarians”. 
For what we need in order to make a success of migration policy are not only bans, but also regulations that allow us to use migration as an opportunity. 
Civil society and human rights 
Ladies and gentlemen, now let me turn to the third point. 
The guidelines identify scope for action. 
They show us how and with which methods we can use this scope for our work to promote peace. 
This sentence clearly serves a political purpose and runs counter to human rights principles. It also violates international obligations with respect to civil and political rights under agreements that Viet Nam itself has signed. 
no matter how hard we Germans try, we will only achieve something lasting if we cooperate with others. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we intend to use these guidelines as a compass for modern German peace diplomacy. 
That is why I say very openly that 
It is especially for her environmental protection efforts that Ms Quynh and her family have suffered a large number of reprisals since the autumn of 2016. These have included attempts at public humiliation in her local community. 
during the last weeks and months I, just like all of you, have been taking part in the debate about reaching a target of spending two percent of GDP on defence in NATO countries. 
when the whole world is talking about rearmament, Germany and Europe have to talk again about disarmament and arms control. 
Yet our population will not shrink, because, thank God, people are living longer. 
The prison sentence is inordinately long and shows that fundamental rights – namely freedom of the press and of opinion, which are laid down in the Vietnamese constitution – were not given due consideration. 
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce speaks of half a million jobs that already need to be filled. 
Eighty percent of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are so crucial for our country, are already reporting problems in finding staff. 
in my country even 20 or 30 years ago, migrants from Spain, Italy, Greece, the former Yugoslavia, Morocco, were referred to as guest workers. 
In all of this, funding mechanisms are of course also important. 
Incidentally, the people who came here had the same idea. 
For example, the children of Turkish parents were sent back to Turkey with the words: 
You’d better go to school in Turkey, because we won’t be staying here long. 
Both internationally and in our own societies. 
Here in Europe we are sometimes very good at telling others that they need to change. 
This very treaty is now jeopardised, firstly due to the concerns about what the Russians are doing, and secondly because the Americans are saying: 
we cannot accept what’s happening over there for ever. 
We have to return to a discussion in which we say: 
The reason for this is simple: 
without people from other countries, our society, and the European community will not stay as strong as it is at the moment. 
yes, we need a defence capability, but it has to be coupled with proactive offers on arms control, on disarmament, especially from us Germans and especially in Europe, ladies and gentlemen. 
Bärbel Kofler, Human Rights Commissioner of the Federal Government, issued the following statement today (30 June) on the conviction of the Vietnamese blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (known by her pen name, Mother Mushroom): 
The fact that authorities are responding to this blogger’s efforts to defend human rights and protect both the environment and consumers in the same way they are responding to other bloggers, namely with reprisals, arrests, and by handing down prison sentences, sends an alarming signal. It is especially worrisome considering the government has proclaimed it is working to implement administrative, environmental and consumer protection reforms. 
What also saddens me is that the Vietnamese Government is not tapping the potential of its engaged citizens to further develop the country. 
The European Union, Germany, the United States and other countries have lobbied intensively in recent months in support of Ms Quynh – with statements, during official meetings and through the EU-Viet Nam Human Rights Dialogue. 
That is a great sign that we do not have two opposing sides on this issue. 
The idea that there needs to be north-south cooperation on migration issues and on establishing a fair migration system is, incidentally, not entirely new. 
Forty years ago, a former German Chancellor adopted this approach: 
If you don’t manage to overcome the gap between rich and poor in the world, one day we will be sending you our children. 
As it has turned out, it is not the Indians who have come, but many others. 
The final report of this North-South Commission, entitled “North-South: A Programme for Survival”, recommended global cooperation in order to establish a fair system of “international mobility”, as the report terms it. 
We evidently did not comply with this recommendation sufficiently, otherwise we wouldn’t have to be discussing the same topic again today. 
for every euro spent on defence capabilities, we should actually be channelling 1.50 euros into development aid and crisis prevention. 
First of all, I would like to thank you for your readiness – despite the approaching summer recess and the other important decisions we have already made today – to discuss an issue which may at first sound somewhat abstract. 
However, I believe that two points have been completely left out of this discussion. 
In the last few days, we’ve been organising the memorial ceremonies for Helmut Kohl. 
A very cruel gauge of the current trend is the number of those who have to flee from violence. 
Even though we here in Germany have experienced, and indeed are still experiencing, challenges with this issue, we have to realise that we aren’t bearing the greatest burden – not by a long chalk! Rather, many other countries around the world are carrying it, for the majority of people flee within their own country or move back and forward between poor countries. 
And – let me be quite open here – we’ve been hearing in the last few days about the huge number of refugees who have once again been arriving in Italy. 
Whatever the debates in the European Union about migration policy: 
we have to ensure that in this issue everyone in Europe, not just a few countries, shows solidarity with the Italians. 
It cannot be that they are left to deal with this situation on their own and that ultimately we’re faced once more with completely chaotic refugee flows in Europe. 
If we not only want to face up to these realities but to ensure that Germany assumes responsibility for bringing about changes, then we need to be clear how we want to do this. 
Since the term of office of my predecessor – the current Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier – we’ve been asking ourselves what Germany’s approach should be and, above all, which tools Germany, the German Government, should employ to help contain violence and displacement. 
Of course, we know that we shouldn’t overestimate our capabilities. Nor, however, should we underestimate what a country like Germany can achieve, especially when it comes to cooperation in Europe. 
Hundreds of thousands or even millions of people paid for this with their lives or health. 
Our efforts to foster peace must therefore be marked by a clear commitment to the primacy of politics, to non-military, civilian intervention, especially where unavoidable military conflicts have to be followed by civilian efforts. This is not only because our Basic Law provides that our foreign policy should rely on diplomacy, conciliation and civilian engagement rather than military force, but also quite simply based on what our soldiers have experienced during difficult missions. 
Ladies and gentlemen, with these guidelines we’re thus putting forward a compass for modern peace diplomacy. 
Either course of action can make one culpable: supplying arms or not supplying them. 
That’s why I believe it’s always wise to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, not to become internationally isolated and, above all, not to send the message that by taking one or other course of action one has done what is morally right. 
I believe we always have to be aware of the responsibility resulting from whatever decision we make, and that we have to be conscious of the risk that either decision may be wrong. 
For of course the work of police officers should help ensure that rule-of-law instruments can be developed in countries where conditions are difficult and that a police force can be established in these countries which, as it were, can make the development of these rule-of-law tools their objective. 
I’ve visited a few police projects of this kind, for example in Mali, and, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can be truly proud of what these police officers have achieved due to their great efforts to promote the rule of law and a code of conduct in compliance with the rule of law. 
Finally, the German Government has committed itself in quite concrete terms to further expanding its own conflict management capabilities. 
Back then, defence capabilities on the one hand and disarmament offers on the other existed side by side.

The key issues of the German G20 Presidency also dominated the Meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers which took place in Bonn on 16 and 17 February. 
At the invitation of Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel, representatives of the G20, some other invited states and various international organisations discussed issues relating to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, peacekeeping, crisis prevention, stabilisation as well as enhanced cooperation with Africa. 
They do so because they hope to obtain better prospects for themselves or their children, or because they want to escape from dire need or inequality with regard to professional opportunities and income.

Gender equality and gender equity 
Around 64% of the global population live in the G20 member countries. 
The problem lies in the consistent implementation of these goals. 
These complex individual motives and pressures do not only clash with the realities of the societies in the countries of origin, transit and destination. 
They also come up against their laws. 
And those mainly consist of things that are prohibited. 
Together they account for about 80% of gross world product and three-quarters of international trade. 
Independent female farmers in Kenya receive weather updates via their mobile phones 
It has to be said that peace policy sometimes requires the deployment of military means. 
It is truly remarkable that significantly greater legal restrictions are imposed on migration than on the global movement of capital and trade, for example. 
At their annual summits, the states traditionally focus on global economic growth and financial market regulation. 
There have to be operations, especially United Nations operations, in which under certain circumstances excessive violence is stopped and further violence prevented also by military means. 
military interventions from the outside, even if they are performed with the best of intentions, do not necessarily bring about lasting peace. 
Germany’s one-year G20 Presidency began on 1 December 2016. 
regulating financial markets, facilitating international trade 
In order to withstand crises in future, the international financial markets must be made more resilient. 
Within the framework of the G20, Germany is therefore advocating better supervision of the financial markets, for example the regulation of shadow banking. 
We want to take a look at this complex network of regulations and restrictions. 
Not only for ethical reasons, but also to protect our own vested economic interests. 
Additional information on women, peace and security 
Many members of this House have got involved, too. 
Above all, it has shown how strong and vibrant – let me put it this way – the peace community is in our country; it, too, deserves our thanks. 
Naturally, we’re indebted to those taking part in operations – soldiers, development workers, etc. – but it is also the community in our country which wants to see Germany remain a strong force for peace which we need to thank.

Protecting children’s rights 
I say this quite clearly as the representative of a country that also struggles to acknowledge the positive aspects of migration in this context. 
For immigration is vital for growth, and Germany in particular needs experts from outside the country, not least because the population is shrinking. 
In Europe one of the largest experiments lies ahead of us: 
During the last few years, I’ve had to learn one thing in particular: 
This is illustrated by the Yazidis, who, as it were, would have been left to be exterminated. 
That, I feel, needs to be part of a frank and open debate. 
Furthermore, against the background of the spread of digital technology, the future of the labour markets themselves has to be addressed. 
within a few years we will lose millions of people of working age. 
the assumption that either supplying arms or not supplying arms is the right thing to do is always a mistake. 
That will be a major challenge for us as an industrialised country, and for that reason alone we should be discussing the issue of migration more openly than we often do. 
What’s more, it includes the work done by our police officers, also that of those who offer advisory services on judicial matters. 
I can see that quite clearly in one of the most visible results of European unification: 
With the sentiment that they would be coming here for a while and then they’d be going back home. 
Today, the people who used to be described here as guest workers have long become part of our country. 
Some have become German citizens, others have not, but regardless of this they are an important, integral part of our country and have also enriched the culture of the nation as a whole. 
I therefore believe that we need to completely rethink our approach towards migration policy. 
And to this end all countries, whether countries of origin, transit or destination, need to be ready to review their own policy in dialogue with others. 
That being the case, I think we ought to take a look at what we need to do differently in order to establish a fairer migration system. 
Not without reason, Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl are mentioned time and again in connection with the NATO Double-Track Decision. 
A few days ago, I was in Iceland for a conference attended by a number of European states. I had an opportunity to visit Höfði House in Reykjavik where Gorbachev and Reagan drafted a treaty from which we still benefit today: the INF Treaty, which did away with land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. 
The aim is to create better conditions for economic investment in Africa and to step up cooperation in the sphere of refugee issues and migration. 
protecting the climate, implementing the 2030 Agenda 
As long as this cannot be specified, it’s difficult to say how much is required, especially when we know that European defence expenditure amounts to 45 percent of that of the US but that, in comparison, European military assets only achieve 15 percent of the efficiency. 
Another important point is not to fall into the disastrous trap of raising military spending while reducing spending on development aid and crisis prevention. 
It’s especially important to me that we – first of all – based our conceptional work, on the one hand, on a critical assessment and, on the other, as I’ve already said, on a dialogue with civil society, with academia, associations and business. 
I believe that this process of debate has not only ensured that we now have produced a convincing document. 
That needs to be part of the deal. 
In this context, I find the two percent debate a bit odd because we should actually start by asking why we need something. 
Such an immigration act could work with a demand-based points system, like the one in Canada. 
This is a major protocol undertaking: when the Heads of State and Government of the major industrialised nations and emerging economies meet in early July, 36 delegations will be coming to the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. 
Efforts to combat tax avoidance are also being addressed, as are the promotion and facilitation of international trade.

Within the G20 framework, Germany wants to make the global economy fit for the future through action to fight climate change and create sustainable worldwide development. 
Whatever form it takes, it needs to provide a transparent, understandable and straightforward regulatory framework and link in with integration measures.

The motto of this year’s Summit is: 
During the Summit, a dinner for the G20 Foreign Ministers will also be held. 
A core team of around 20 from the Federal Foreign Office Protocol Directorate-General will ensure that the Summit goes off smoothly. In the critical phase, this team will swell to 150 staff members. 
That is why we need legislation to lay the foundation to help us view immigration as an opportunity for our country and not just a threat. 
Moreover, the Summit will look at the implementation of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda. 
That is why a joint meeting of the G20 and African states took place ahead of the Summit. 
establishing a fair immigration and migration system is a global task, as, indeed, is the responsibility to treat refugees with dignity. 
After all, if we want to counteract illegal migration, we need to create legal immigration opportunities. 
In search of conciliation – Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to the Gulf region 
During a three-day trip, the Foreign Minister wants to gain a first-hand impression of the situation in the region following the outbreak of the Qatar crisis. 
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir receiving Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in Jeddah 
In several bilateral talks with representatives of the governments in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, he is calling for efforts to ease the acute tension. 
I don’t want to spell that out in detail here, but transparent “migration options” counteract the impression that you can only build up a livelihood in Europe if you claim asylum on the grounds of persecution, even if you are not really in need of protection. 
And especially if you put your fate into the hands of human traffickers and thereby put your life at risk. 
It is further defined by various other instruments, such as the conclusions of the UN Commission on the Status of Women and resolutions by the Security Council and Human Rights Council. 
Gender equality in the UN: UN Women 
The Foreign Minister made this clear during his first visit with his Saudi counterpart Al-Jubeir in Jeddah. 
On Tuesday (4 July), the German Foreign Minister is travelling from Abu Dhabi to Doha, the capital of Qatar. 
He went on to say that the negotiations should focus on restoring good neighbourliness in the Gulf Cooperation Council. 
In the light of the complex crises of our time, the prime task therefore is to do prevention work but also to provide rapid support and to work effectively and in an interconnected manner. 
Dealing with setbacks is as much a part of this as the readiness to take calculated risks, especially if new ideas are used to tackle this task, as we intend to do on the basis of the guidelines. 
To this end, we want to intensify our partnerships with our European friends, the United Nations, as well as with regional organisations such as the African Union. 
Everyone in this House knows that a compass alone is not enough, but that we also need hardware, as it were, instruments, ultimately always money, too. 
I don’t want to say anything about the details. 
It cannot be that this no longer is an issue. 
Gabriel is in the region to gain a comprehensive and nuanced insight into the situation there. 
It raises the minimum age for participation in armed conflicts from 15 to 18 and prohibits the forced recruitment of young people under the age of 18. 
Violence against children in armed conflicts – a case for the Security Council 
The UN Security Council has determined that violence against children in armed conflicts poses a threat to peace and security (Resolution 1314 of August 2000) and has dealt with this topic on a regular basis since then. 
A special Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict was set up in 2005. Germany chaired this group during its membership of the Security Council in 2011/2012. 
Find out more about the UN Security Council’s endeavours to protect children in armed conflicts 
The Foreign Minister is therefore appealing to the parties to the conflict to transform the Gulf Cooperation Council into a strong forum for cooperation and conflict resolution. 
Sigmar Gabriel stressed, 
UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children 
When legal forms of migration exist, such options create incentives for countries to cooperate with us more willingly in taking back their own citizens. 
Those are just a few thoughts on what Germany, as a migration destination, should be doing. 
Children at a school in Jordan. Syrian and Jordanian children are taught here in shifts. 
List of conflict parties 
With this in mind, we intend to draft a Global Social Compact here and to consider regulations which will be incorporated into the Global Compact on Migration in 2018. 
Maybe some of you will prick up your ears when you hear the word “regulations” and once again associate it with barriers and bans designed to restrict migration. 
That is not our goal. 
Vocational training and international cooperation in vocational training 
Germany’s dual system of vocational training, which combines theory and practice, is in ever greater demand around the world. 
Germany’s dual system of vocational training, which combines theory (vocational schools) and practice (companies), is in ever greater demand around the world. 
That is why we need to establish a clear regulatory framework that is able not only to reflect the interests of the countries of destination in a one-sided approach, but which focuses on the interests and rights of all parties. 
And that is why we need partnerships 
The dual system of vocational training requires close cooperation between the state, business and social partners, which fits into the structure of the society in question. 
Trainee hairdressers 
between countries of destination and origin, such as the one exemplified by Morocco and Germany through their Co-Chairmanship. 
Rather, development opportunities for the countries of origin also need to be outlined which show that we are not interested in a one-sided brain drain in an attempt to attract the cleverest people, but that we are concerned with fair principles, fair migration, as Willy Brandt called for in the North-South Commission. 
For this cannot be achieved by states going it alone – neither at national nor at international level. 
And for the Forum’s joint work on establishing a fair migration system I wish us perseverance, productivity and ultimately a successful outcome for all those involved! 
And thirdly, fair standards could perhaps also help us in the fight against human traffickers and people smugglers, who exploit the predicament of migrants for profit. 
Under the heading “Shaping an interconnected world”, the German G20 Presidency is setting three priorities: 
Employment policy is another important factor. For example, efforts are to be made to better integrate refugees into the labour markets. 
Other topics that Germany wants to promote under this heading include the digitisation of the global economy, fighting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), pandemic preparedness as well as women’s economic empowerment. 
The Partnership with Africa is another focus of the G20 Presidency: a lasting improvement is to be made to the quality of life of people in Africa. 
Climate protection is also a priority for the German G20 Presidency, as is the supply with sustainable and renewable energies. 
Global warming is to be limited to well below 2°C – that is the aim of the Paris Agreement. 
One example is the initiative iMOVE: Training in Germany. 
Under its chairmanship, the Security Council focused on protecting schools and hospitals (Resolution 1998).

It also supports projects on preventing recruitment, demobilising child soldiers and helping them reintegrate into society, for example through educational programmes. 
The reasons for his visit are manifold: 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict 
Virginia Gamba of Argentina has been Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict since March 2017. 
On Wednesday (5 July), the official handover of the Chinese pandas Meng Meng and Jiao Qing will take place at Berlin Zoo.

The German Government opposes any form of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and has been making every effort to combat discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. 
Giant panda Meng Meng at the breeding centre in Chengdu 
The German Government opposes any form of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and has been making every effort to combat discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons. 
The central issues are combating violence against homosexuals and the criminal prosecution of homosexuality, as well as access to education, the right to have a family, freedom of assembly and the right to asylum. 
To implement its strategy, the German Government set up the German Office for International Cooperation in Vocational and Educational Training (GOVET). 
As a non-partisan institution of the federal ministries, GOVET – which is based at the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB) – organises coordination within Germany among the ministries and many other players. 
To meet the growing demand for collaboration in vocational training, the German Government has established a Central Office for International Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training. 
But the truth is that 
The two new arrivals are called Meng Meng (Little Dream) and Jiao Qing (Little Treasure) and are currently busy settling into their specially built panda enclosure.

And if we look at its final report today, we have to ask ourselves self‑critically 
For many of the questions, and, by the way, the answers, are still relevant today. 
I believe that today, more than ever before, we have a mission, and also a responsibility, to ensure fairness with regard to international mobility. 
A global responsibility shared by all players, as the United Nations 2030 Agenda makes very clear. 
Yet another point is at least as important: if we approach migration in the right way, it will, of course, also benefit our society. 
I therefore want to highlight three points that, in my view, illustrate why we need a different approach to migration in Germany and Europe. 
in Germany we have long been a country of immigration, so we should be able to control this process more effectively by means of an immigration act. 
For Germany, too, needs attractive and modern regulations if it is to be a country of destination for migrants. 
that it is the irregular migrants who are usually exploited. They are simply not the winners. 
This is due not only to the considerable interest that two strong trading nations have in good business relations.

The pandas Meng Meng and Jiao Qing are already the focus of considerable media attention. 
The giant panda, ailuropoda melanoleuca, is a nocturnal animal, has dark rings around its eyes and eats large quantities of vegetarian food. 
It would be malicious to suggest that this alone makes Berlin the ideal place for the pandas to live. 
Vocational training in the hospitality sector 
It also stems from the shared conviction that in times of global uncertainty it is important that Germany and China stand side by side in the quest to preserve and strengthen the multilateral order. 
Furthermore, GOVET is responsible for the Round Table for International Vocational Education and Training Cooperation. 
The Round Table meets regularly at state secretary, ministerial and working level. 
GOVET and the Round Table help German stakeholders in international vocational training cooperation to take coherent action. 
GOVET plays a key role in the Federal Government strategy for one-stop international cooperation in vocational education and training, which the Federal Cabinet adopted in early July 2013 under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 
Looking forward to Meng Meng and Jiao Qing: on his trip to Beijing, Foreign Minister Gabriel was given two cuddly pandas in anticipation of the arrival of the real ones Gaertner/photothek.net 
That information found its way to Beijing, Berlin’s partner city. 
President Xi Jinping in Berlin 
China’s President Xi Jinping is visiting Berlin from 4 to 7 July. 
at the end of the week the G20 Summit is being held in Hamburg, and Germany and China are celebrating the 45th anniversary of the commencement of their diplomatic relations. 
pandas and Berlin go well together, because the city’s emblem is a bear – albeit a brown bear. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping therefore agreed to loan two pandas to Berlin Zoo to mark his state visit from 4 to 7 July. 
45 years of diplomatic relations 
Sino‑German coin: a commemorative medallion has been produced to mark the diplomatic anniversary and the handover of the pandas 
The reason for Xi Jingping’s state visit is not only the G20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July. 
Germany and China are also celebrating the 45th anniversary of the commencement of their diplomatic relations this year. 
After rather tentative initial steps in the early 1970s, relations have developed so rapidly, especially since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s policy of reform and opening up, that exchange and cooperation between the two countries have never been as close as they are today, notwithstanding all differences of opinion on human rights issues. 
Beyond the sphere of high‑level politics, exchange is also thriving in the area of intersocietal cooperation: 
There are more than 32,000 Chinese exchange students in Germany, more than 120 partner schools with a broader German curriculum in China and, a recent development, increased cooperation in the area of football. 
As ambassadors of the Sino‑German friendship in Berlin, their task in future is to bring together people from both countries, beyond the sphere of high‑level politics. 
which is the central point of contact for international vocational training cooperation.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on North Korea’s missile test 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (4 July): 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the death of Cardinal Meisner 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (5 July) on the death of Cardinal Joachim Meisner: 
Minister of State Böhmer attends UNESCO World Heritage Committee session in Krakow 
From 7 to 10 July, Minister of State Maria Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, will head the German delegation to the 41st session of the World Heritage Committee in Krakow. 
She issued the following statement today (5 July): 
Germany and its partners will urge that the sanctions against the regime be implemented efficiently and consistently. 
During my own chairmanship of the World Heritage Committee in 2015 I always stressed that the real work does not end with the inscription of a site. Rather, this is only the start. 
We will miss his critical voice. 
North Korea tested another ballistic missile today. According to its own reports, this was its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 
His life and work are an enduring reminder to us, and also to me personally as a Lutheran Christian, that spiritual preconditions and ethical guidelines fashion and unite us as a society beyond the realm of day-to-day politics. 
I condemn this illegal action by North Korea in the strongest and most categorical terms. 
To this end, it must immediately refrain from all further nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches and end the related programmes. 
The key points on this year’s agenda include the consultations on the state of conservation of the World Heritage sites. 
154 reports have been submitted to the Committee. 
Examples of this are the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, as well as Vienna and Liverpool. 
Germany has nominated the caves and Ice Age art in the Swabian Jura region, the expansion of the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar and Dessau to include the Laubengang Houses in Dessau and the ADGB school in Bernau, as well as Naumburg Cathedral and the landscape of the rivers Saale and Unstrut, for inscription as cultural or natural heritage sites on the World Heritage List. 
The annual session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee has evolved into an international forum for the protection and preservation of the world’s cultural and natural heritage whose great power lies in the universal attention it attracts. 
From 2 to 12 July 2017, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee is meeting in Krakow/Poland and is being chaired by Prof. Jacek Purchla. 
The current 21 members of the Committee are, in addition to Poland, Angola, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Croatia, Cuba, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Philippines, Peru, Portugal, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. 
The state of the Heritage sites on the List of World Heritage in Danger is especially alarming. These mainly consist of sites in Syria, Iraq and Yemen at risk due to war and civil conflict. 
However, climate change, infrastructure measures or construction projects also pose a threat to sites. 
This year, consultations will also be held by the Committee on 33 nominations for the World Heritage List. 
With the death of Cardinal Joachim Meisner, we are mourning the loss of an influential figure in the history of divided Germany. 
During his time in the GDR in particular, he was an indispensable voice for Christians of the Catholic faith and a regular contributor to debates on morality and society. 
That would lend a new dimension to the threat posed by North Korea to peace and security. 
Regardless of the missile’s range, in launching the missile the regime in Pyongyang has once again violated Security Council resolutions, despite clear warnings by the international community. 
The international community will continue to demand that North Korea halt these provocations and comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Minister of State Böhmer chaired the 39th session of the Committee, which took place in Bonn in 2015. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (5 July) on the situation in the Gulf region: 
Minister of State for Europe Roth on the persecution of homosexuals in Chechnya 
If these reports are true, it would be a shock for us all. 
We expect the Russian Government to ensure the persecuted are protected and the perpetrators finally brought to justice. 
Others are in touch with our Embassy in Moscow. 
We will continue to do our utmost to help the persecuted. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the crisis in the Gulf region 
The fact that we in Europe live in colourful, liberal and open societies must become more than mere lip service. 
In light of the current situation, this is a result that will not complicate the further process at any rate. 
That is why the Federal Foreign Office's commitment in taking in persecuted homosexuals from Chechnya is so important. 
Today’s meeting of the coalition’s four in Cairo was not a breakthrough, but at least it did not lead to new sanctions. 
We are pleased by the commitment shown by US Secretary of State and the Kuwaitis, which was instrumental in helping to reach this outcome. 
It is important now for the parties to enter into a negotiation process. 
We are receiving reports that the persecution of homosexuals in Chechnya has begun once more. 
But here the suffering has a completely different dimension. 
I am particularly pleased that now in three cases we were able to bring those affected to Germany. 
It is the logical consequence of us working all over the world to promote fundamental values such as freedom, equality and human dignity. 
Today’s meeting of the coalition’s four in Cairo was not a breakthrough, but at least it did not lead to new sanctions. The attendees agreed that “the next steps would require careful preparations and assessment”. 
Speech by Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, at the Foreign Ministers Conference in Rome 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth issued the following statement today (5 July) on current developments in Chechnya where, since the end of Ramadan, there have once again been increased attacks on homosexuals: 
Unfortunately, discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is still on the agenda much too often - also in Europe. 
It is not acceptable that people have to fear for their lives because of their homosexuality. 
We need to follow up with concrete steps which visibly reaffirm our conviction. 
In this context, I am grateful for the close cooperation with other countries. 
Almost every day, we see dramatic images of refugees making their perilous way across the Mediterranean. 
All this shows us that the situation is beyond dramatic and that we need to take action. 
We need to tangibly improve the situation for everyone – most importantly for refugees, but also for the transit and host countries. 
We are not starting from scratch. 
in the EU Partnership Framework, the Valletta Action Plan and the Rabat and Khartoum Processes, we have agreed on instruments to tackle the causes of forced and irregular migration in a targeted way. 
for example with Italy, France, the Niger and Mali in the framework of EU migration partnerships. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (9 July): 
We will also provide one million euros in 2017 to the project suggested by Italy on measures in African transit countries. 
Education is a crucial factor. 
The Federal Foreign Office is the main funder of this programme. 
That is the dilemma facing us. 
I myself have been able to see the situation faced by Syrian refugees, for example in Lebanon. 
What I heard from many people there was depressing. 
We need to guarantee that all refugees enjoy protection in accordance with international standards. 
At the same time, we need to be honest and to look at the topic from different angles. 
They have no legal prospects of being allowed to stay in Europe and yet they risk their lives in the desert or on the sea. 
The global compacts on refugees and migration to be adopted by the United Nations in 2018 are an important step in this direction. 
The decision to leave one’s home country in the hope of a better life is often influenced by deliberate disinformation spread by people smugglers. 
We need to provide better information to people about the risks of such decisions and about the legal situation. 
It must be in the interests of all of us to tackle people-smuggling rings and criminal gangs efficiently. 
However, the host communities in the transit countries also need our particular support. 
That is why we want to do more as regards long-term investments in public infrastructure and private-sector companies in the regions affected. 
No political concessions should be made when it comes to our values. 
As the main country of arrival in Europe, Italy is currently bearing much of the burden. 
We need to fight for these values and defend them: in politics, in the workplace, on the streets and within our families. 
Foreign Minister Alfano, I can promise you that we will not leave Italy to cope on its own and that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you, 
- Europe is a community based on diversity, colourfulness, tolerance and respect. 
But we need greater European solidarity. 
And we will not stop demanding this of our partners and friends in Europe. 
- LGBTI rights are human rights. 
- Europe is first and foremost not an economic project but a community of shared values! 
Anyone who attacks this foundation by calling these values into question destroys Europe! 
We are not asking for privileges, we don't want free gifts or special advantages. 
Speech by Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, at the Foreign Ministers Conference in Rome 
A shared responsibility for a common goal – solidarity and security. 
Gays and lesbians have to go through the world with their eyes open. 
No one can remain unmoved by these images, 
Many of us know all too well what it means to be on the receiving end of discrimination, oppression and exclusion. 
which enable us to see and understand the face of human misery and misfortune. 
We are therefore fighting for all minorities. 
We stand with the Roma! 
We stand with refugees! 
I would therefore like to thank my colleague Angelino Alfano for organising this conference here today. 
We stand with Jews and Muslims! 
We stand with people with disabilities! 
Only by working together and in a spirit of partnership will we overcome the great challenges that the migration crisis poses for us. 
- Homophobia has two ugly sisters: 
It is right that we are focusing on the situation in the transit countries. 
racism and misogyny! 
Germany does not only provide financial support in this context, but also contributes other tangible forms of support, such as taking in refugees from particularly affected countries as part of the relocation process. 
For this reason, I am pleased that Germany will increase its funding in many cases, thus complying with Italy’s urgent request for support. 
Via the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the Federal Foreign Office is contributing 48 million euros over a period of three years with Italy and the European Commission to an IOM regional migration-management project. 
In addition, we will provide IOM with a further four million euros to support its work in Morocco and Egypt. 
That is why the Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative (DAFI) in UNHCR awarded 2000 scholarships worth 4.2 million euros in total to refugees in Africa last year. 
As part of its humanitarian assistance, Germany also supports people in need of help in crisis-hit regions and after natural disasters, including in refugee and migrant contexts. 
In 2016, the German Government more than doubled its humanitarian assistance in Africa to 270 million euros compared with the previous year. 
time that we unfortunately do not always have, as there is no doubt that the transit countries need help soon. 
But we cannot delude ourselves. There are no fast solutions and change takes time – 
UNHCR and IOM do essential work in this area in particular and I would like to take this opportunity to express my great respect for their endeavours. 
Where we can, we will do more. 
Increasingly, people are leaving their homes and undertaking the perilous journey to Europe solely because they lack economic opportunities. 
IOM is addressing this issue and working with its partners to enable people to return home voluntarily and to reintegrate with dignity. 
Those who want to curb irregular immigration must create a wider range of legal options. 
be it in the negotiations on the future Common European Asylum System or in taking in refugees under the relocation programme. 
According to our understanding of the law, there is no evidence of anti-government activities arising from this. 
There has been no sign of human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang since his detention in July 2015. No defence counsel or family members have been allowed contact with him. 
Reports claiming that he has been tortured have emerged from the prison via an indirect route. 
Human rights activist Wu Gan has also been detained on suspicion of subversion since May 2015. 
I am particularly concerned about the fate of human rights lawyers Wang Quanzhang and Jiang Tianyong, as well as human rights activist Wu Gan. 
His lawyer was granted access to him for the first time at the end of 2016. At their meetings, Wu Gan reported that he had been severely tortured. 
According to reports, he is believed to have sustained lasting injuries to his foot after being tortured. 
As a master architect and teacher, Hannes Meyer played a key role in the global impact of the Bauhaus. 
A list of demands made by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain has been rejected by Qatar on the basis of its national sovereignty. 
Extending the World Heritage Site is fitting and strengthens the extraordinary universal value of the Bauhaus. 
Press conference in Abu Dhabi 
At the same time, he stressed: 
Frank conversation: 
meeting with the Foreign Minister of Qatar 
The German Foreign Minister reiterated this in his meetings with his counterparts in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar: 
However, this requires goodwill, de-escalation and dialogue on all sides.” 
Mediation appreciated: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with the Emir of Kuwait 
My country is endeavouring to meet its responsibilities. 
But we are not doing so alone, as truly durable and lasting solutions can only be achieved if we work together, 
Via the guidance and education measures of the CSDP missions in the Sahel and EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA, we are supporting state security structures in Libya in their fight against people-smuggling rings. 
Kuwait, where Gabriel arrived on Wednesday (5 July), has a key role to play. 
“We are grateful to the Emir for his mediation efforts and strongly support his endeavours. 
His country is making tremendous efforts to bring the parties to the conflict together.” 
Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministers of Qatar’s four adversaries – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE – met in Cairo to discuss Qatar’s response to their list of demands. 
The sanctions imposed on Qatar have not been tightened. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel considered this a step in the right direction: 
The fronts seem to have hardened. 
“We are convinced that stopping the financing of terrorist organisations and extremists – no matter by whom or from where – is absolutely essential: with no ifs and buts, and in a practicable and transparent manner. 
We want one thing: the same rights for all. 
Discrimination has to stop! 
- Today, Budapest is sending a message promoting Europe instead of nationalism, respect instead of contempt, diversity instead of naivety, pride instead of fear, love instead of hate! 
I also ask the Chinese Government to investigate reports published on torture in prisons in a transparent way. 
Over 30 of them were first taken to unknown locations for six months and the majority then transferred to prison in January 2016. 
They were denied contact with their lawyers and families, many were ostensibly forced to make confessions on television, the start of their trials has been delayed for months, 
and the members of their families have been put under pressure. 
Through their work, those arrested sought to defend their clients’ rights and to uphold the rule of law. 
A number of those who were arrested at the time are still awaiting their trials and their release under conditions that contravene all principles of the rule of law. 
Under these circumstances, the victory over IS will be a lasting one. 
Draft of a joint Franco-German declaration on the stabilisation of Mosul 
Our thoughts are also with the victims who were subjected to the unspeakable horror of IS. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the arrest of human rights defenders in Turkey 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy, issued the following statement today (7 July) on the arrest of human rights defenders in Turkey: 
Amnesty and many other independent voices of Turkish civil society make an invaluable contribution to the protection of human rights. 
The circumstances of the arrests on the Turkish island of Büyükada are still unknown. 
Those detained include Idil Eser, who is Director of Amnesty International Turkey. 
At this time of liberation, we pay tribute to the achievements of the Government and the people of Iraq 
Together, France and Germany will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi authorities on the path towards stabilisation, reconstruction, reconciliation and good governance. 
The continued criminal prosecution of committed human rights defenders, journalists and opposition leaders threatens to stifle the voices that are absolutely essential for every democratic society. 
I am deeply concerned about the reported arrest of human rights defenders. 
At the time of the arrests, all those affected were participating in a routine workshop focusing on information management. 
After the recent arrest of Taner Kılıç, this is the second time in only a few weeks that a high‑ranking representative of this world‑renowned NGO has been taken into custody. 
I therefore call on the Turkish Government to immediately and clearly state its reasons for these arrests and to swiftly get to the bottom of these accusations with an investigation that is based on the rule of law. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on settlement construction in East Jerusalem 
Federal Foreign Office on the release of Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López and his transfer to house arrest 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (9 July) on the release of Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López and his transfer to house arrest: 
The Federal Government welcomes the decision of the Venezuelan Government to release Leopoldo López after more than three years in prison. 
Its recommendations on upholding the principles of the two-state solution are as valid today as they were a year ago. 
Yesterday, opposition leader Leopoldo López was released from prison and transferred to house arrest. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the second anniversary of the 709 crackdown in China 
Today marks the second anniversary of a serious blow to human rights and the rule of law in China during an incident commonly referred to as the 709 crackdown. 
Further decisions are pending in the coming weeks, including in the East Jerusalem district of Sheikh Jarrah. We view these pending decisions with great concern. 
There are credible reports of torture and numerous other violations of even the most basic rule-of-law standards. 
I call on the Chinese Government to release all those detained during the wave of arrests against human rights lawyers and activists in 2015 and 2016 and to restore their full personal freedom without delay. 
From around 9 July 2015, more than 300 lawyers and other human rights activists were temporarily arrested and interrogated throughout China in what became known as the 709 crackdown. 
The German Government’s stance on the illegality of settlement construction is well known. 
Human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong was, until the end of May, under “house arrest at a specified location” – essentially a secret prison. 
It was only then that he was officially arrested on suspicion of subversion. 
His case is considered to be a direct precursor to the 709 crackdown. 
In view of the continued settlement construction, we wonder how the Israeli Government intends to enable the US Administration and other international actors to work towards resolving the decades-long conflict. 
In July 2016, the Middle East Quartet noted that a one-state reality was increasingly taking hold. 
This followed confidential talks that had been held in the past few weeks between the Venezuelan Government, mediators and the family. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement in Berlin today (7 July) on the construction of 944 housing units in the Israeli settlement Pisgat Ze’ev approved by Jerusalem municipal authorities this week: 
On 4 July, the municipal authorities’ Construction and Planning Commission approved the construction of further housing units in occupied East Jerusalem, including 940 units in Pisgat Ze’ev alone. 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer on the extension of the Bauhaus World Heritage site 
Although Leopoldo López is not yet free, this step could be the beginning of a national dialogue with a view to resolving the political, economic and social crisis in Venezuela. 
In this context, the release of Leopoldo López from prison is also an acknowledgement of the efforts of those who have tirelessly worked to protect democracy and rule‑of‑law principles in Venezuela over the past weeks and months. 
Between 1919 and 1933, the Bauhaus, which was initially based in Weimar and later moved to Dessau, revolutionised the architectural and aesthetic language of architecture and living concepts. 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer on the recognition of the caves and ice age art in the Swabian Jura as a World Heritage site 
The objects found here, such as the Venus of Hohle Fels, are fascinating examples of prehistoric art which have also left a deep impression on me personally. 
They are among the most important archaeological sites worldwide. 
The objects are between 32,000 and 43,000 years old. 
All the objects come from cave sites in two valleys in the Swabian Alps – the Achtal approximately 15 km to the west of Ulm, and the Lonetal around 20 km north east of Ulm. 
The miniature works of art discovered here and the musical instruments made of ivory and bone are unique testimonies to the history of humankind. 
They include the ivory mammoth from the Vogelherd Cave, the Venus of Hohle Fels and the Lion-man of the Hohlenstein-Stadel. 
Eight flutes are also among the finds.

Participants of the migration conference in Rome 
“Those who want to curb irregular immigration must create a wider range of legal options. 
“The migration conference in Rome boosts cooperation between countries of origin and Europe,” says Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe 
At the invitation of Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, the Foreign Ministers of 15 European and African countries and representatives of the European Union, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met in Rome on Thursday (6 July) to discuss ways to provide better support to the countries most affected by the refugee and migration crisis. 
Germany was represented by Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, 
The UNESCO World Heritage Committee has decided to extend the current World Heritage site in Dessau and Weimar to include the Houses with Balcony Access in Dessau-Törten and the ADGB Trade Union School in Bernau. 
In recognition of this accomplishment, the Bauhaus buildings in Dessau and Weimar were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1996. 
Hannes Meyer, whom Walter Gropius appointed head of the Bauhaus architecture department in 1927 and who served as director of the Bauhaus from 1928 to 1930, significantly shaped the training of architects at Bauhaus. 
This is why the existing World Heritage site has now been extended to include the Houses with Balcony Access at the Dessau-Törten housing estate and the ADGB Trade Union School in Bernau, both of which Hannes Meyer designed together with the Bauhaus architecture department. 
who underlined the particularly difficult situation currently faced by Italy, where almost all refugees from Libya arrive by sea, and assured Italy of Germany’s support in his speech. 
As the most recent German World Heritage site, the caves and ice age art in the Swabian Jura allow us to follow the oldest traces left by human settlement in Europe. 
In Kraków today, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed the caves and ice age art in Swabian Jura in Land Baden-Württemberg on the World Heritage List. 
Roth described current measures, 
the further four million euros Germany is providing to IOM for its work in Morocco and Egypt; 
and the one million euros Germany will provide in 2017 to the project suggested by Italy on measures in African transit countries. 
Call on countries of origin to take on responsibility 
Apart from financial support, however, Roth underlined the responsibility of countries of origin and transit, 
which he said must do everything in their power to ensure that people can live in safety and dignity in their home countries so they do not have to undertake the perilous journey across deserts and the sea. 
Roth added that there should be a greater focus on paths to legal migration in the future. 
Helping refugees in need must continue to be our priority. 
“In the refugee issue, we feel it is our duty to uphold the principles of humanity with refugees and of international solidarity. 
At the same time, we Europeans are responsible for the safety of our population and the protection of its external borders,” he said. 
The head of the German delegation to the 41st session of the World Heritage Committee, Minister of State Maria Böhmer, issued the following statement today (9 July): 
We can achieve more together than by acting alone 
It was a major protocol undertaking: for the meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the major industrialised nations and emerging economies, 36 delegations gathered in the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. 
stating that on the issue of trade, consensus had been reached that it was necessary to keep markets open. 
Moreover, all parties want to work together to combat protectionism and unfair trade restrictions. 
They also want to safeguard the stability of the international financial system. 
such as the Federal Foreign Office’s contribution, along with Italy and the European Commission, of 48 million euros over a period of three years to a regional migration-management project; 
Only in this way can we destroy the cynical business model used by brutal people smugglers,” Roth said after the conference. 
A core team of around 20 from the Federal Foreign Office Protocol Directorate-General worked to ensure that the Summit went off smoothly. In the critical phase, this team swelled to 150 staff members. 
A 120‑page master plan set out the Summit schedule. 
The Federal Government expressed its satisfaction with the outcome of the Summit, 
After the Summit, Foreign Minister Gabriel expressed his thanks to the police officers and all other helpers for their commitment in difficult circumstances: 
“I would like to thank all members of the police forces, emergency services and aid organisations for their outstanding work.” 
Statement by Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, on the Foreign Ministers conference in Rome 
Prior to his departure for the Foreign Ministers conference in Rome, Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, issued the following statement today (6 July): 
“In the first six months of this year, more people than in any other year arrived in Italy from Africa in search of protection and better living conditions. 
Criminal people-smugglers base their business model on human suffering. 
People in search of protection are still dying in the Sahara and Mediterranean. 
At the invitation of Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, we and our African and European colleagues, as well as representatives of the European Union, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), will discuss how we can provide particular support to the countries currently most affected by large migration flows. 
In Europe, the highest percentage of migrants and refugees currently arrive in Italy. 
The Italian Government has rightfully pointed out that the country needs support in what is a task for Europe as a whole. 
Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with Italy in this regard. 
Responsibility and solidarity on the part of all EU Member States must go hand in hand. 
We also want to share experiences with the important transit countries in Africa. 
We cannot wait until people are on the Mediterranean to solve pressing displacement and migration issues. 
We need to address these issues at an earlier stage. 
Host communities need our help to integrate refugees and migrants. 
Regions whose main source of income to date has come from people smuggling need stable economic alternatives. 
We want to help those who would like to return to their home country, away from terrible conditions in a third country, rather than risking their lives on the Mediterranean. 
Germany is already very committed. 
Via the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, the Federal Foreign Office is contributing 48 million euros over a period of three years to a regional migration-management project with the IOM. 
Italy and the European Commission are further partners. 
We will provide 20 million euros to the project in 2017 alone. 
We will continue our support. 
Our aim is to work together to bring about fair and good solutions. 
This will not happen overnight, 
but we are taking an important step in the right direction today. 
However, we do not want to simply stop there. 
“Communications, cultural and educational work abroad creates the necessary space for better understanding the stories and narratives, the dreams and traumas of our partners in the world and for opening up access to our culture. 
This will be one of the issues discussed by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian at the Franco-German Council of Ministers on 13 July.” 
That is why we want to work with France in particular to expand cooperation in third countries. 
Schools and branches of the Goethe-Institut, university and academic cooperation arrangements are examples of such spaces. 
Minister of State for Europe visits Budapest 
On 8 July, Minister of State Roth met a number of politicians and representatives of civil society. 
Dr Andreas Görgen, Director-General for Culture and Communication at the Federal Foreign Office gave the following reaction to the outcome: 
This is only possible if there is space in both the analogue and digital areas where we can reach out, seek exchange as well as perceive and discuss differences. 
He said it was important to keep channels of communication open despite difficult times. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth visited the Hungarian capital on 8 July. 
In the age of fake news and propaganda, we have to take a closer look at digital spheres and be on hand with our own range of offers, content and structures. 
We want to further develop cultural relations and education policy at European level, especially with France – our closest neighbour and friend. 
as well as taking part in a discussion with various non-governmental organisations and learning about the work of the newly founded party Momentum. 
Joint press conference 
A discussion with representatives of Hungarian NGOs 
Hungary is a difficult partner for us at the moment. 
Opinion is divided on refugee policy, academic freedom, the independence of NGOs and the media, and issues relating to the rule of law. 
My meetings with NGOs and the leaders of Momentum have been a particularly clear reminder to me of what a major role the engagement of civil society plays in a democracy.” 
Defending European values 
Minister of State Michael Roth said, 
After his talks, Minister of State Roth and several other members of the diplomatic corps took part in the Budapest Pride Parade. 
I was particularly impressed by the number of European flags on display. 
These values need to be continually defended and reasserted.” 
“The Pride Parade is a beacon of tolerance, solidarity and human dignity. 
But their use does show that we mustn’t take our European values, like mutual respect and protection of minorities, for granted. 
While there, he met the Secretary of State for European Union Affairs in the Prime Minister’s Office, Szabolcs Takács, 
“Important to keep channels of communication open” 
“Much of what is happening in Hungary is causing us sincere concern. 
That is why it’s so important to keep channels of communication open. 
Together with my opposite number, Secretary of State Takács, we talked not only about subjects like the future of the EU, migration and Brexit, but also about the significance of vibrant and active civil society. 
Minister of State Roth called the Budapest Pride Parade 
“a beacon of tolerance and human dignity”. 
Minister of State Roth issued the following statement after the parade: 
The German Government works both at bilateral level and within the framework of international organisations to enhance women’s rights and to foster gender equality. 
Protecting women’s human rights and achieving legal, economic and cultural equality for women in all areas of society remain key challenges, which have only increased as a result of conflicts, tyranny, displacement and unregulated migration. 
The German Government works both at bilateral level and within the framework of the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN) and other international organisations to enhance women’s rights and foster gender equality. 
In addition, traditional values, roles and behavioural patterns often lead to women being specifically disadvantaged as regards their economic, cultural and social rights, such as access to food, education or healthcare. 
Women and girls are also particularly subject to the effects of (civil) war, refugee movements resulting from conflict, and sexual violence and rape, which are increasingly being used as weapons of war. 
Women often suffer multiple discrimination, disadvantaged not merely due to their gender but also because they belong to an ethnic or social minority, or on the grounds of their sexual orientation (multiple violation of human rights). 
Improving women’s human rights therefore remains a central element of the German Government’s human rights policy, 
The framework for the German Government’s international gender-equality policy is defined by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the resolutions adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 and the findings of the review of the implementation progress (most recently in 2015). 
The German Government’s policy is also based on regional agreements, for example the European Convention on Human Rights. 
The acquis is supplemented and updated by the addition of new documents, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
A large number of international agreements and instruments in the field of women’s rights sets clear goals and obligations for the international community, such as gender equality and the elimination of discrimination. 
Germany and its EU partners have agreed on means and ways to achieve these goals, including concrete projects to support women and girls, in the EU Guidelines on Violence against Women and Girls and Combating all Forms of Discrimination against them. 
Large number of projects on gender equality 
As part of its efforts to promote women’s rights, the Federal Foreign Office provides support to a large number of projects aimed specifically at gender equality, as well as other human rights projects furthering objectives such as good governance, education and healthcare in various countries and regions. 
Public awareness campaigns, conducted in collaboration with local non-governmental organisations, are at the forefront of this work. 
These projects include providing training on women’s rights in Nicaragua and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, supporting measures to prevent violence against women in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay, promoting internally displaced women’s involvement in politics in Colombia, supplying advice on implementing women’s economic and social rights in Morocco and on their access to justice in Cambodia, promoting women’s electoral rights in Côte d’Ivoire and holding business start-up seminars for Kurdish-Iraqi women. 
UN Women (short for the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women) places equal emphasis on the UN’s normative and operational work in the field of gender equality and gender equity. 
It is tasked with promoting the cross-cutting topic of equal opportunities throughout the whole UN system, providing political advice to multinational bodies and member states, and running development programmes on the ground. 
UN Women works on the basis of the entire UN acquis on gender equality, 
which includes the Platform for Action and Declaration adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security, the role of women in peace processes and conflicts. 
The Commission on the Status of Women, which was established in 1948 on the initiative of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to promote women’s rights and ensure gender equality, monitors UN Women’s normative work. 
Far too often, violations of children’s human rights are a daily occurrence, especially in areas occupied by terror organisations and in the context of displacement and conflict. 
Protecting children’s rights is a top priority for Germany both at international level and within the framework of the European Union (EU). 
Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child were drawn up during the German EU Council Presidency in 2007. 
In this way, the EU committed itself unreservedly to promoting and protecting all rights of the child as laid down in central international and European human rights conventions and in relevant political undertakings. 
One core element is the elaboration of national strategies to implement the guidelines in ten pilot countries. 
The EU is currently revising and updating the guidelines in order to improve the protection of children and to make it even more efficient. 
Children’s rights in the UN 
It has been ratified by almost all the countries in the world. No other international treaty has achieved such universal validity. 
Comprehensive universal children’s rights are enshrined in the Convention. 
The four fundamental rights of the child set out in the Convention are the right to life and health, the right to development, the ban on discrimination and protection of children’s interests, and the right to be involved and have a say in all decisions affecting their lives. 
The UN treaty body established by the Convention, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, monitors the Convention’s implementation and deals with complaints by individuals. 
In practice, this means that if any country violates a right enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child or one of its two Optional Protocols, children and adolescents can take their complaint directly to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, provided that their complaint has not been upheld by their own country’s legal system. 
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is the German Government’s most important partner in implementing children’s rights worldwide. 
Protection from sexual exploitation and trafficking 
Prior to the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in March 1990, the UN Commission on Human Rights established a mandate for a Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 
In 2000, an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child defined these three violations of children’s rights as criminal offences under international law and stipulated that the States Parties must prosecute such offences, 
thus creating a further basis in international law to combat the sexual exploitation of children. 
Prohibition of the recruitment of minors (child soldiers) 
Syrian children in a refugee camp in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon 
A further Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child also adopted in 2000 concerns the protection of children in armed conflicts. 
The German instrument of ratification was deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 13 December 2004. 
EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict 
The EU adopted Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflicts in December 2003 in an attempt to structure its fight against the use of children in armed conflicts more effectively. It updated these guidelines in 2008. 
The guidelines are being implemented in 19 priority countries. 
As UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, Marta Santos Pais of Portugal works worldwide to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against children. 
Her appointment in 2009 was the outcome of a study on violence against children commissioned by the UN General Assembly that called for urgent action to prevent violence against children. 
The German Government works closely with the Special Representative and also funds her work through voluntary contributions. 
Protecting children in armed conflicts 
Children are the most vulnerable people in any armed conflict, which is why it is essential that the international community ensure they have special protection in such situations. 
Children are particularly hard hit by wars and armed conflicts. 
They are put at risk when they are recruited as child soldiers and are often the deliberate targets of abuse and killings. 
However, it is not only these direct threats that adversely affect children’s lives. 
Schools are often closed, occupied or used for other purposes. 
This robs children of their future. 
Children are keen to learn, knowing that education will give them the chance of a better life. 
They therefore need schools to be a safe place where they can learn and play and are offered a future. 
When children are sick, weak or injured, they need a safe place to shelter where people take care of them, provide them with food and give them new hope. 
In 2005, the Security Council introduced a mechanism to protect children in armed conflicts. 
Its aim is to draw up a United Nations (UN) black list of parties to conflict that recruit child soldiers, deliberately kill and maim children or subject them to sexual violence. 
Not only are the conflict parties thus publicly discredited, but sanctions such as travel bans or asset freezing can also be imposed on them. 
Only if listed parties cooperate with the UN and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict can they be deleted from the list. 
protecting schools and hospitals 
School pupils in a primary school in Ethiopia 
During Germany’s membership of the UN Security Council from 2011 to 2012, it chaired the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. 
As a result, the UN list now includes parties that attack schools and hospitals, making them accountable for the consequences of their actions. 
The aim is to draw up action plans with the parties listed which, when successfully implemented, would result in their removal from the list. 
Such agreements reached between the parties to a conflict, the relevant government and the UN are usually based on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration measures. 
Although its chairmanship of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict has ended, the German Government continues to work within the UN to improve the protection of children in armed conflicts and to ensure that the perpetrators of prohibited acts are punished. 
In pursuit of that aim, Germany works closely with the EU, UN and NATO. 
Every year, the Special Representative reports to the relevant UN committees and the governments affected on the fate of children in armed conflicts, thus highlighting the need for continued political and diplomatic endeavours to protect children in armed conflicts. 
Protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons (LGBTI rights) 
Human rights include the right to free sexual orientation. 
However, homosexuality is a criminal offence in around 80 countries; in some countries, same-sex acts can even incur the death penalty. 
Following the attack in a club in Orlando in June 2016, the Brandenburg Gate was lit up in the colours of the rainbow. 
The 29 Yogyakarta Principles presented by internationally renowned human rights experts in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, on 23 March 2007 are regarded as the global standard for guaranteeing LGBTI persons’ human rights. 
LGBTI rights in the UN 
An open and objective discussion on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity is still very much a taboo in many countries and regions in the world and within the United Nations (UN). 
Nevertheless, progress has been made. 
Important milestones and achievements to date – also as regards German foreign policy – include: 
the statement of December 2008 on sexual orientation and gender identity with regard to specific LGBTI rights, which was read out in the UN General Assembly and has since been signed by 68 countries 
the joint statement on ending acts of violence and related human rights violations on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, which was adopted by the Human Rights Council in March 2011 
and has already been signed by 85 countries 
the Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity initially adopted in June 2011 by the Human Rights Council (14 July 2011) 
the mandate in July 2016 for an independent UN expert who works at international level to ensure protection against discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity 
along with the UN’s Free and Equal campaign, which was launched in 2013, the mandate creates an address in the UN for the rights of LGBTI persons. 
Since September 2016, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, a human rights and UN expert, has been the first Independent Expert on Protection against Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. His tasks include identifying cases of discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and making suggestions on how their causes can be tackled more effectively. 
The EU wants to use these guidelines to react to violations of LGBTI persons’ human rights in third countries and to have an impact on the structural causes of such violations. 
The emphasis is on measures to decriminalise LGBTI persons, eliminate discrimination against them, and protect and support human rights activists campaigning for LGBTI rights. 
Projects and bilateral cooperation 
Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe, met the organisers of the Belgrade Pride Parade in September 2016. 
Particularly in countries where the situation of LGBTI persons is especially precarious, the Federal Foreign Office seeks to help the victims of discrimination. 
Within the scope of bilateral cooperation, it has already promoted numerous projects aimed at improving the human rights situation of LGBTI persons. 
In 2017, the Federal Foreign Office is funding a large number of projects run by local partners in countries including Nigeria, Indonesia, Ukraine, Russia and Montenegro aimed at improving the human rights situation of LGBTI persons. 
It also regularly co-organises conferences with the Hirschfeld-Eddy Foundation to which LGBTI activists from all over the world are invited in order to enable them to coordinate their work more effectively. 
At the Time to React conference on 1 June 2017, stakeholders from Germany and abroad discussed the declining space for civil society caused by new restrictive laws. 
In 2016, the conference focused on LGBTI rights in South East Europe – a region where there have recently been very positive trends, unlike the Middle East, which was the main region discussed at the conference in 2015. 
The funding of the film “Parada”, which addresses attacks on gay pride parades (demonstrations for the rights of LGBTI persons), was a project that attracted great media attention. 
The film by Serbian director Srđan Dragojević was filmed in Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia 
and won the prestigious Panorama Audience Award at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in 2012. 
It sparked an important discussion in South East Europe that led to a gradual change in views in society. 
Successful gay pride parades are now held in Belgrade each year. The Federal Foreign Office regularly takes part in these events. 
The German Government is active at national and international level in protecting persons with disabilities. 
On 13 December 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
This was a historic step which, under the auspices of the UN, gives people with disabilities comprehensive human rights protection against discrimination.

The adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities means there is now a human rights convention giving most of the estimated one billion people in the world with physical or mental disabilities better access to their legal rights. 
This universal convention is intended to help people with disabilities enjoy a self-determined life and equal opportunities, and to participate fully in social, economic, political and cultural life. 
Its aim is to protect people with disabilities from all forms of discrimination and any “handicaps” created by society and the social environment. 
The now outdated principle of welfare is thus replaced by the recognition of disability as part of human diversity. 
The Convention also strengthens the rights of women and children, 
explicitly referring to the particular discrimination faced by women and girls with disabilities. 
Since both time and major financial resources are required to give effect to all these rights, the convention allows States Parties to realise them progressively, as funding permits. 
Convention’s monitoring mechanisms 
examining the national reports States Parties must submit at regular intervals on implementation of the Convention 
receiving and examining complaints by individuals in accordance with the Optional Protocol adopted at the same time as the Convention 
investigating credible cases of serious and systematic violations of rights laid down in the Convention 
An independent monitoring authority responsible for overseeing national implementation of the Convention has been set up in the German Institute for Human Rights (DIMR), 
which provides recommendations, makes suggestions on implementing the Convention, and advises the German Government, the German Bundestag and other organisations on issues concerning the Convention.

The Human Rights Council’s Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supplements the work of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, for example by making country-specific recommendations and providing technical support in implementing the Convention. 
With German support, this mandate was transferred from the Commission for Social Development to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2014, thus achieving a paradigm shift from a focus on welfare to a focus on human rights. 
Germany’s role 
The German Government works both nationally and internationally to protect people with disabilities and was actively involved from the outset in drafting a modern human rights convention designed to achieve this. 
Germany was thus one of the Convention’s pacesetters within the EU, acting as the EU’s chief negotiator for key draft articles. 
Civil society was closely involved in the negotiating process; a representative of the German Disability Council was a member of the German delegation and played an active role in the negotiations. 
Freedom of religion and thought 
Promoting freedom of religion and thought around the world is an important part of Germany’s human rights policy. 
Despite the numerous international legal instruments developed to protect this human right, freedom of religion and thought remains under threat or subject to restrictions. 
Promoting freedom of religion and thought around the world is thus an important part of Germany’s human rights policy. 
Sri Harmandir Sahib, a Sikh shrine, in Amritsar, India, 
Freedom of religion and thought is a right enshrined in a large number of United Nations (UN) resolutions and international agreements, including the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN’s 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. 
Freedom of religion encompasses many different rights 
Freedom of religion and thought includes the freedom of an individual to have or to adopt a religion or world view of their choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others, to practise their religion or world view without interference. 
It also includes the freedom to change one’s religion, as well as the freedom not to adhere to any religion or world view. 
Many restrictions around the world 
Despite the numerous international legal instruments developed to protect this human right, freedom of religion and thought is subject to restrictions in many parts of the world. 
In some countries, only members of a particular religion may hold high political office. 
In many parts of the world, people may be denied equal rights or discriminated against because of their religion or world view. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel met religious dignitaries during a visit to Iraq on 20 April 2017 
Attacks on members of religious minorities, religious persecution and the exploitation of what is purportedly “religiously motivated” violence to serve political ends are unfortunately a common occurrence. 
Such violence may be prompted not only by religious motives but also by socio-economic disparities. 
It is therefore important to analyse exactly what is behind attacks on a given religious minority before deciding on measures to give them better protection. 
Restrictions on freedom of opinion may also be used to curtail freedom of religion and thought. 
For example, blasphemy is a criminal offence in many countries. 
Blasphemy laws make it a punishable offence to express one’s opinion on religious matters freely or to give up one’s religion, and sentences may even include the death penalty. 
Germany and the EU promote freedom of religion and thought 
Promoting freedom of religion and thought around the world is an important part of Germany’s human rights policy. 
In its bilateral political dialogue with third countries, the German Government and its EU partners seek to protect and foster freedom of religion and thought. 
Germany provides systematic support to projects designed to enhance universal respect for freedom of religion and thought, in particular to intercultural dialogue programmes aimed at promoting better understanding between people of different faiths. 
In June 2016, the German Government published a report on the status of freedom of religion and thought worldwide (PDF, 1 MB), 
which systematically illustrates the situation using examples of typical violations of the human right to freedom of religion and thought by state and non-state actors. 
It focuses on the problem of the perpetration of violence in a religious context 
and also covers the German Government’s foreign-policy endeavours to prevent violations of this human right. 
At EU level, protecting freedom of religion and thought is an issue that features regularly in EU Council Conclusions, declarations and démarches. 
In June 2013, the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union adopted EU guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, which provide EU delegations and member states’ missions abroad with practical guidance for their work in this area. 
Activities at UN level 
Buddhist monks at Mount Wutai in China 
Since 2004, the EU has regularly raised the topic of freedom of religion and thought in the UN, 
where for a long time, however, there were highly contradictory positions on the universality of the human right to freedom of religion and thought. 
For example, in its 1990 Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) made the validity and enjoyment of human rights subject to the tenets of sharia and among other things denied individuals the right to convert to another religion. 
There have also been repeated attempts to make freedom of religion a collective rather than an individual right. If this right is vested in the religious community rather than the individual, the former has the right to determine the scope of and any limits to such freedom for the latter. 
In March 2011, there was a shift in the entrenched negotiating positions after the OIC agreed to drop its demand that “defamation of religions” be legally defined as a violation of human rights, instead tabling a resolution text calling for efforts to combat negative stereotyping and religious hatred. 
The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief investigates violations of this important human right and draws up recommendations on how they can be prevented and how freedom of religion and thought can be guaranteed all over the world. 
German human rights expert Professor Heiner Bielefeldt of the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg held this position from 2010 to 2016. 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the conviction of a Bahraini human rights activist 
Published on 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (11 July) on the conviction of human rights activist Nabeel Rajab: 
Joint declaration by the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany on the stabilisation of Mosul 
“For France and Germany, the liberation of Mosul offers hope for a united, democratic and secure Iraq. 
The defeat of IS in Mosul represents a unique opportunity to rebuild the country and to work towards achieving national reconciliation. 
He has the right to appeal the conviction. 
At this time of liberation, we pay tribute to the achievements of the authorities, the fighters and the people of Iraq. 
Further criminal proceedings are pending against him on account of critical statements on Twitter. 
We also congratulate the United Nations on its success in dealing with an extremely difficult situation. 
Under these circumstances, the victory will be a lasting one.” 
Freedom of expression enjoys constitutional protection in Bahrain. 
Freedom of expression and freedom of the press, along with freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate, are essential prerequisites for a functioning constitutional democracy. 
After being pardoned in 2015, human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was rearrested last summer and put on trial. 
That also means showing tolerance towards expressions of opinions that are critical of the government. 
The challenges facing Iraq are huge and the international community needs to continue its work in support of the country. 
France and Germany will carry on their efforts to help the Iraqi Government to respond to these pressing challenges by initiating mine clearance measures and helping to restore basic services in order to foster the voluntary and durable return of displaced Iraqis under the best possible security conditions. 
I was disappointed to learn that Bahraini human right activist Nabeel Rajab was sentenced to two years in prison yesterday for giving interviews to foreign media. 
I deplore this sentence against Nabeel Rajab and call on the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain to meet its international obligations to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
Yesterday’s sentence by Bahraini Criminal Court was handed down for supposed false and misleading information on human rights and democracy in Bahrain that Mr Rajab is alleged to have given in interviews with foreign TV stations. 
One hundred years ago today, German troops deployed mustard gas for the first time. 
The unspeakable suffering this caused must never be forgotten. 
The use of poison gas in Syria and Iraq shows quite alarmingly how little some warmongers have learned. 
We will do everything in our power to investigate, outlaw and prevent the use of chemical weapons. 
Through the creation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), based in The Hague, the international community has already made considerable progress in its attempts to outlaw chemical weapons once and for all. 
stabilisation is the next priority 
The metropolis of Mosul in northern Iraq has finally been liberated from the terrorist militia IS. 
This is a great success for the Iraqi army, which has been supported by the Global Coalition against Daesh, which Germany is also involved in. 
However, the international community has not yet achieved its goal. 
Civil and political rights 
The priority now is to stabilise the region as swiftly as possible in order to offer the people in the region a livelihood once again. 
We need to do everything we can to bring to justice those responsible for the terrible chemical weapons attacks in recent times.

Unimaginable atrocities 
The unimaginable atrocities committed by the IS terrorists will continue to be felt for a long time to come. 
Stabilisation is what matters now 
The key task now is therefore to achieve stability swiftly. 
Iraq – Franco-German declaration on the stabilisation of Mosul 
Our thoughts are also with the victims who were subjected to the unspeakable horror of IS. 
The victory over IS also requires the full mobilisation of the Iraqi authorities with the support of their allies on the path towards stabilisation, reconstruction, reconciliation and the implementation of inclusive governance in line with the federal constitution. 
It is important to overcome divisions within the population in order to facilitate reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. 
What is more, the young generation in particular is in need of future prospects. 
Education and employment are the best tools for fighting radicalisation. 
Germany’s involvement in Iraq

When they return, some will only find the ruins where their homes once stood. 
The Assad regime must finally provide clarity on the actual extent of its chemical weapons programme and cooperate with the OPCW to this end. 
Germany’s involvement in Iraq is focused on humanitarian assistance and stabilisation. 
Germany and the United Arab Emirates co-chair the Stabilisation Working Group of the Global Coalition against Daesh. 
Building trust 
with community policing 
Both a peace dividend that is tangible in the short term and stable state structures are required in order to make this military victory a lasting success. 
Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi population to this end. 
Tackling IS booby-traps with German assistance 
The projects that it is supporting seek to build shelters for people, re-establish the drinking water supply and sewage system, provide basic health care and supply people in need with food. 
It is especially important in the long term to set up a functioning administration and to create a state security apparatus that all citizens trust.

Germany is contributing an estimated 100 million euros for humanitarian assistance and a further 46 million euros for stabilisation projects in 2017. 
Others face an even worse fate as IS laid booby‑traps on its retreat, and so some people may still fall victim to the militia after the hostilities have ceased. 
Booby‑traps must be cleared and destroyed infrastructure rebuilt. 
The Federal Foreign Office is contributing 17 million euros to help clear booby‑traps alone. 
The Federal Foreign Office is therefore supporting a project in the area of community policing to the tune of almost eight million euros. 
In this project, local police forces enter into a direct dialogue with citizens in order, in a peaceful manner, to address injustices committed and to develop solutions to the most pressing problems together. 
Community policing in Iraq 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (12 July) on the centenary of the first use of mustard gas by German troops in Ypres, Belgium, during the First World War: 
We are therefore supporting the OPCW particularly as it continues to show great dedication and the necessary impartiality in fighting for this goal of eradicating the use of these barbaric weapons, which can inflict untold suffering even in very small quantities. 
Today we therefore want to remember the soldiers who died in Ypres on 12 July 1917. 
This day also sounds a warning to us: 
never again must we allow a deed like this to go unpunished. 
Even 100 years on from Ypres, we have still not succeeded in liberating the world from chemical weapons. 
Only four members of the United Nations have not yet acceded to the CWC. 
The OPCW oversees compliance with the CWC and monitors the destruction of existing stockpiles of chemical weapons. 
Germany’s history bestows on it a special responsibility to create a world free of chemical weapons. 
Chunfengdeyi – Chinese bloggers in Germany 
Blogger and street artist Qi Xinghua in Berlin 
The campaign is called Chunfengdeyi, which means “happy in Germany”. 
At the heart of the campaign are three short trips to Berlin, Hamburg and Munich by popular Chinese bloggers with an interest in Germany. 
The bloggers cover a wide range of topics – art, journalism and food. 
The trip was co-organised by the German Embassy Beijing and Visit Berlin. 
Visits to Hamburg and Munich 
In late July, a popular journalist and blogger will explore Hamburg by bike and also visit Schwerin. 
Promoting a positive image of Germany abroad is an important job for German missions abroad.

Their visits to Germany will take place between June and August. 
And their followers are in with a chance to win one of three trips to Germany for two people in September – they just need to follow the posts closely! 
Qi Xinghua – art in Park am Gleisdreieck in Berlin 
The first trip was made from 26 to 30 June by internationally successful street artist Qi Xinghua, who has around a million followers on Chinese social media. 
During his visit, he created an impressive work of street art in Park am Gleisdreieck in Berlin. 
He was accompanied by a video artist and also wrote a blog about his experiences in Berlin and the region, including a visit to the East Side Gallery, trips to Potsdam and Teufelsberg, a concert in Pierre Boulez Saal, and encounters with Berliners. 
In this way, Qi Xinghua was able to convey the special atmosphere in Berlin to his young Chinese audience. 
Human rights – a cornerstone of German foreign policy 
Germany continues to campaign assiduously for human rights around the world. 
Indeed, working for human rights is not only a basic tenet of our foreign policy – it is also in Germany’s interests. 
The international symbol for human rights 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
It was a vision of a better world that brought men and women from across the globe to Paris nearly seventy years ago, in 1948. 
The Basic Law thus not only guarantees human rights in Germany, but also obliges us to work to protect human dignity and fundamental freedoms throughout the world.

Within the Federal Foreign Office, alongside Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Bärbel Kofler, there is an entire division responsible for human rights and gender issues. 
Together they make use of a great variety of instruments. 
Funding programmes for non-governmental organisations, political dialogue, public statements and quiet diplomacy, for example, have already improved the human rights situation in many countries.

“We must remember that peace will only prevail on our continent with Russia – and never against it.” 
Security is the priority 
Many countries in the world still hand down death sentences and carry out executions. 
Germany is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of this cruel form of punishment. 
Even though resistance to the death penalty has steadily grown during the last few years, death sentences are still handed down and executions carried out in many states around the world. 
However, this can only be achieved by working together. 
Germany opposes the death penalty on ethical and moral grounds as well as for reasons of legal policy and is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of this cruel form of punishment. 
What is the OSCE? 
The Federal Government’s engagement in the fight against torture and abuse, too, is resolute and untiring. Together with its EU partners, it is striving to strengthen the international mechanisms to combat torture. 
The primary goals are the worldwide abolition of torture and the complete rehabilitation of torture victims. 
Protest against the death penalty 
The death penalty is not expressly prohibited under international law. 
All actors in eastern and western Europe regard the OSCE as the forum in which relevant security issues can be discussed. 
The Foreign Ministers of the OSCE participating States met in Mauerbach near Vienna on Tuesday (11 July) to lay the groundwork for the Ministerial Council, which will take place in Vienna in December. 
Germany was represented by OSCE Special Representative Gernot Erler. 
As on previous occasions, the meeting focused on regional conflicts in the OSCE area, in particular the situation in Ukraine. 
It is essential to maintain dialogue and build trust, particularly in such difficult times, 
He called for greater willingness to compromise and advocated making a new attempt to achieve rapprochement between the EU and Russia. 
It is of particular importance to Germany that the international staff of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine have good working conditions and to ensure their safety.

He was followed by over 200,000 netizens on each day of his trip, and the hashtag #chunfengdey has already been viewed over a million times. 
Well-known food blogger Shishang Xiaomi will undertake a culinary voyage of discovery in Munich and Würzburg in August. 
In ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, however, a total of 84 states to date – including Germany and all other EU member states – have undertaken to abolish the death penalty. 
Under this Article, death sentences may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, and all safeguards to ensure due process under the rule of law must be observed. Carrying out the death sentence on people who were minors at the time of the crime and on pregnant women is prohibited. 
In Europe, Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which entered into force in 2003, also obligates those member states of the Council of Europe that have signed and ratified it to abolish the death penalty in all circumstances. 
Improving dialogue in the OSCE – Informal Ministerial Meeting near Vienna 
The topics discussed included confidence-building measures between eastern and western Europe, migration, terrorism and human rights. 
and always helpful to recall shared values. 
Kurz pointed out that on the contrary, however, a bloc mentality had returned to the continent. 
Belarus is the last state in Europe which carries out executions. 
Outside Europe, too, there is a trend towards the abolition of capital punishment. 
The death penalty has been abolished in almost all Latin American countries, but also in central Asia and many states in southern Africa. 
A total of more than 130 states have abolished the death penalty or refrain from carrying it out, whilst some 50 states continue to carry out executions. 
EU policy on fighting the death penalty 
Germany and the other EU member states have been actively campaigning against the death penalty for many years. 
This campaign is based on the Guidelines to EU Policy towards Third Countries on the Death Penalty. 
These guidelines define the campaign against the death penalty as a central human rights issue within the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). 
Furthermore, they set out principles and criteria for practical action, for example on the question as to when the EU makes public statements or in what form it intervenes vis-à-vis other states. 
The aim is to prevent the imposition of the death penalty in individual cases, as well as to influence the practice in individual countries and, for instance, to bring about a moratorium on or abolition of the death penalty. 
Germany and the EU actively campaign against the death penalty 
UN Convention against Torture 
In Germany, the NPM is the National Agency for the Prevention of Torture. 
The UN Convention against Torture is also the basis and reference document for EU and Council of Europe policies and measures against torture and inhuman treatment. 
With the adoption of the guidelines for EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment on 9 April 2001, the EU created an instrument which strengthened its commitment to the worldwide abolition of torture. 
A jointly developed global action plan, whose key points were implemented during Germany’s EU Presidency, consisted of numerous demarches in third states in which the EU addressed the problem of the use of torture and called for its abolition. 
The EU guidelines also help ensure that the fight against torture and its abolition is a fixture in dialogues with third states which the EU conducts as an organisation and the member states at bilateral level. 
The German Government, too, is obliged to adhere to the EU guidelines in its actions. 
The focus is on individual cases. 
European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
The Council of Europe also has a convention against torture: 
the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which entered into force on 1 February 1989. 
Visit to Afghanistan 
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 13 July for an official visit. 
Accompanied by his wife Elke Büdenbender, he landed at the airport in Mazar‑e‑Sharif in the north of the country in the morning. 
To this end, visits are made to prisons, psychiatric institutions and other establishments in which people are detained. 
The reports on these visits, which contain concrete recommendations for action, are published with the consent of the state in question. 
UN Special Rapporteur on Torture 
During his one-day visit, the Federal President met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah for political talks in Kabul. 
In the afternoon, the Federal President and his wife visited the memorial at Camp Marmal to remember the German soldiers killed in the line of duty. 
Afterwards, the Federal President addressed German troops as well as representatives of international forces and civilian personnel. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Franco-German Council of Ministers in Paris 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement on the Franco-German Council of Ministers in Paris today (13 July): 
What we have achieved in Europe and between France and Germany in the past fifty years is unique. 
We must do more together in and for Europe. 
Often it is non-governmental organisations that draw attention to problems, give marginalised groups a voice and seek to address their concerns. 
They thus make an important contribution to social cohesion and long-term stability in a society. 
Civil society and human rights are mutually dependent: 
civil-society engagement plays a crucial role in protecting and promoting human rights, 
but equally, civil society can only flourish where human rights are comprehensively guaranteed. 
However, a robust legal framework that complies with international standards and effective access to justice are not in themselves enough: 
Civil society under threat 
This phenomenon, often called “shrinking space”, has become a global trend to be found not only in authoritarian regimes. 
The close partnership between Germany and France is not an end in itself. 
Another objective today is to modernise our partnership with France 
The priority now is to strengthen our common European foreign policy, a foreign policy that we consider to be all‑encompassing – from diplomacy, crisis prevention and development assistance to military cooperation. 
and to work towards a form of cooperation that enshrines our bilateral relations even more deeply in Europe. 
At the bilateral level, we will agree on a whole package of initiatives – from youth work, the joint work of cultural institutes and improved cooperation among our foreign services to closer collaboration in the area of security and defence and strengthening our common European engagement in Africa – that will demonstrate that we intend to cooperate with one another across the board. 
I am also delighted that we finally have an opportunity to reach an agreement on a joint Franco-German investment fund at the Franco-German Council of Ministers today that will ensure that start‑ups enjoy improved starting conditions in our countries. 
I have strongly backed this idea and it is most welcome that it is now receiving such great support. 
Germany protects human rights defenders 
The Federal Government supports these courageous people. It enters into dialogue with them, helps with targeted support for specific projects, and uses diplomatic means to protect them. 
To this end, it keeps a constant close eye on the position of human rights defenders, sometimes with help from specialist non-governmental organisations. 
In doing so, Germany cooperates closely with other European Union member states. 
The basis for this cooperation is provided by the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, which were drawn up in order to effect a lasting improvement in the situation of human rights defenders worldwide. 
What does the EU do to protect human rights defenders? 
Germany regularly supports projects run by and for human rights defenders. 
Moreover, the Federal Government frequently intercedes with other governments in support of human rights defenders. 
In addition, the Federal Chancellor, the Foreign Minister and numerous other senior representatives of the Federal Republic frequently meet prominent activists, as well as previously unknown but commendable authors, lawyers or doctors, 
because assuring them of media attention is one of many ways to protect them. 
Protecting human rights defenders is an integral part of the Federal Government’s Action Plan on Human Rights, so it is still a top priority for German foreign policy. 
Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law 
UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders 
According to the Declaration, a human rights defender is, in principle, anyone who seeks by peaceful means to promote and protect human rights. 
This means that not only human rights activists enjoy protection as human rights defenders, but also, for instance, journalists, lawyers, doctors, volunteers and women and men who campaign only occasionally for human rights. 
UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
The UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders of 1998 is the principal reference and policy document for efforts to protect human rights defenders not only of the United Nations but also, for example, the EU or the OSCE. 
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders – since 2014 Michel Forst from France – monitors implementation of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
He reports regularly on specific issues or situations in individual countries, thus ensuring that threats against and intimidation of human rights defenders are not forgotten. 
He also makes recommendations for the improved protection of human rights defenders. 
EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders 
The EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, most recently updated in 2008, recognise the indispensable role played by human rights defenders in promoting human rights and democracy and define the EU’s principles, objectives and possible measures in multilateral forums and vis-à-vis non-EU states. 
The main points of the Guidelines, which Germany strongly endorses, are 
development and fostering of systematic contacts with human rights defenders by EU member states’ missions abroad; 
ensuring that the situation of human rights defenders feeds into all aspects of EU foreign policy (“mainstreaming”). 
EU financial support for human rights defenders 
regular reports by the missions on the situation of human rights defenders in their host countries and development of local strategies for their protection; 
The EU offers financial assistance for human rights defenders as well as political support. 
Be it access to decent work or adequate healthcare – 
millions of people around the world are being deprived of economic, social and cultural rights. 
This is a question not only of resources and political decision-making, but also of the poor implementation of internationally binding rules.

Basis in international law: 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
Even the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 lists, in Articles 23 to 27, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to education, work and an adequate standard of living, including food, medical care and housing. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the death of Liu Xiaobo 
Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (13 July): 
Modernising Franco-German relations 
Federal Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Franco-German Council of Ministers 
This document was not only the basis on which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but also resulted in his conviction and long-term imprisonment the year after its publication. 
Germany and France already enjoy close cooperation in all of these areas. 
Liu Xiaobo is survived by his wife, Liu Xia, who stood by him throughout his imprisonment and his illness. 
“Another objective today is to modernise our partnership with France”, Gabriel added. 
We wish her strength at this difficult time, and strongly urge the Chinese Government to lift the restrictions on her freedom of movement and communications without delay. 
She and her brother Liu Hui should be allowed to leave China immediately and travel to Germany or another country of their choice, if they so desire. 
“Doing more for and in Europe” 
ESC rights – protection against interference in fundamental areas of life 
His fearless vision coalesced in Charter 08, a declaration that he played a key role in drafting. 
Liu Xiaobo and his wife had most desperately wanted to come to Germany. 
I deeply regret that their wish was not granted. 
The aim for the future is to expand these relations still further. 
Particularly important priorities here are closer cooperation on issues of common security, as well as joint European engagement in Africa. 
It was with this in mind that the Franco-German Security and Defence Council also convened prior to the meeting. 
Statement by Federal Government Human Rights Commissioner on the executions carried out today in Japan 
Germany and France do not want their cooperation in all of these areas to be confined to the bilateral level. 
Two people were executed in Japan on 13 July, 
Germany and Japan are close partners and work together in a spirit of trust on many issues. 
There is an open discussion in Japanese civil society on the abolition of the death penalty. 
The latter is the third case in which a death penalty handed down by a lay judge court has in fact been carried out. 
But material resources also play a role when it comes to realising a well-functioning, well-equipped judicial system, humane prisons, a sound electoral system – prerequisites for guaranteeing civil and political rights. 
who are themselves only told about the execution after the event. 
There are currently 124 prisoners on death row in Japan. 
All human rights are indivisible, universal and apply equally to all. 
In the Federal Government’s eyes, there is no “ranking” of human rights. 
I was dismayed to hear of the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo today. 
We mourn the loss of an extraordinary man who unfailingly campaigned for democracy, human rights and civil rights using non-violent means. 
I now consider China to be under a duty to investigate, swiftly, credibly and transparently, whether his cancer could and should have been discovered much earlier.

Human rights and the 2030 Agenda 
In September 2015, the 193 UN member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
During the negotiating process, the Federal Government was determined to anchor the protection and promotion of human rights firmly in the 2030 Agenda and to point out that sustainable development and human rights are mutually dependent.

the National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights 
At a cabinet meeting in December 2016, the Federal Government adopted the National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights, 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth participated in the Western Balkans Summit in Trieste on 12 July. 
The Ministers discussed how regional integration of the Western Balkan countries can be improved. 
which aims to improve the human rights situation all along the supply and value chain in Germany and worldwide. 
To this end, the Action Plan combines the strengths of the various stakeholders from government, business, civil society and the trade unions.

WASH: Human right to clean drinking water and sanitation 
663 million people have no access to improved drinking water and 2.5 billion have no adequate sanitation. 
The resulting diseases kill more children than malaria, measles and AIDS put together. 
This is therefore one of the key challenges of our day. 
Every dollar invested in clean water brings eight dollars of benefit to the economy 
Whilst the human rights to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation are universally recognised, they are not universally implemented. 
Meeting these rights means that every individual must have access to healthy, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water, in sufficient quantities for personal needs and for use in the home. 
Similarly, sanitation facilities must be safe, hygienic, socially and culturally acceptable and affordable, and protect privacy and dignity. 
Clearly this cannot be done for nothing, but the financial outlay brings a huge economic benefit: 
every euro invested in this area can increase GDP by eight euros. 
German-Spanish initiative on human rights to water and sanitation

Against this background, Germany and Spain have long been committed to the human rights to clean drinking water and sanitation. 
The Franco-German Council of Ministers convened in Paris on Thursday (13 July) under the chairmanship of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron. 
Numerous ministers joined the heads of government to discuss common projects. 
“What we have achieved in Europe and between France and Germany in the past fifty years is unique”, said Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Council of Ministers. 
For instance, the joint work of cultural institutes is to be expanded as well as cooperation between the German and French foreign services. 
“We must do more together in and for Europe”, stated Gabriel. 
Germany backs the work of the Special Rapporteur not only financially but also by supporting relevant resolutions in international bodies such as the Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the General Assembly. 
In 2013 Germany and Spain finally managed to persuade the UN General Assembly to explicitly recognise the human right to water for the first time. 
In 2015 the General Assembly adopted a resolution enshrining the rights to water and sanitation. 
One aim in doing so was to ensure greater attention for the sanitation aspect of the issue. 
Guaranteeing the human rights to water and sanitation is an individual right and creates no claims between states. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (13 July) on the latest use of the death penalty in Japan: 
bringing the number of people executed in the country since December 2012 to nineteen. 
I would therefore like to ask the Japanese Government to reconsider its current practice and to suspend further use of the death penalty. 
“International understanding from the bottom up” – End of the German-Russian Youth Exchange Year 
On Thursday (13 July), young people from Germany and Russia celebrated the end of the German-Russian Youth Exchange Year. 
Logo of the German-Russian Youth Exchange Year 
I welcome this discussion, which forms a crucial basis for dialogue. 
German-Russian relations thrive above all on the many different contacts existing between our societies. 
“I’m particularly pleased that the Regional Youth Cooperation Office can now finally get down to work. 
By establishing networks and promoting exchange among young people, the office will substantially contribute to reconciliation in the region. 
This understanding, he went on, enabled trust to grow, or to be rebuilt where it had been lost.

Despite the political differences 
The European Union remains open to all countries of the Western Balkans. 
The Youth Exchange Year is one of several crossover years organised between the two countries. 
102 countries around the world, more than half of all countries in the world, have completely abolished it, while a total of 140 countries no longer carry out executions. 
Speaking then, the Minister stressed that it was above all the links between engaged individuals, towns and cities which carried and characterised relations between Russia and Germany: 
“Despite some policy differences, for instance on Ukraine and Syria, we must not abandon exchange between our civil societies.” 
Initiatives like the crossover years are intended to strengthen and intensify the exchange between Germany and Russia. 
German-Russian bilateral relations 
Stabilising our immediate neighbourhood is also in our own interest,” Minister of State Roth said after the meeting of Foreign Ministers. 
In both Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, new governments had just recently been formed.

I am very pleased about this, because I think it will help to achieve progress that should first and foremost benefit their country’s citizens,” the Minister of State for Europe went on to say. 
Visit to Skopje:

“Doing more for Europe together” – Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Franco-German Council of Ministers 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel announced the establishment of a Franco-German investment fund for start‑ups. 
Culture, education, business and social affairs, security and defence – the meeting had a wide‑ranging agenda. 
“While there are many points of reference for us to work on, we are pleased to have an opportunity to inject new momentum into our relations as a whole”, said Chancellor Merkel prior to the meeting. 
The Council of Ministers is therefore looking to provide fresh impetus. A range of bilateral initiatives were presented. 
The 1963 Élysée Treaty: the bedrock of the Franco-German friendship 
On the contrary, the aim is to enshrine the Franco-German partnership even more strongly within a common Europe. 
Investment fund for start‑ups 
European start‑ups are also set to receive greater support in the future. 
“I am delighted that we finally have an opportunity to reach an agreement on a joint Franco-German investment fund at the Franco-German Council of Ministers today”, said Gabriel. 
State Secretary Ederer was impressed by the young people: “With their own ideas and concrete projects, they brought this exchange year to life and approached each other with great openness.” 
During his subsequent visit to Skopje, Roth met with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, Deputy Prime Minister Bujar Osmanj and Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov. 
At the Federal Foreign Office on Thursday (13 July), young people from Germany and Russia celebrated the end of the German-Russian Youth Exchange Year 2016/2017 in the company of State Secretary Ederer and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. 
A revived exchange 
As a result, there has been a shift in trend: there was a tangible revival in the exchange between Germany and Russia. 
The next one is following on now: together with his Russian colleague, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel launched the German-Russian year of municipal and regional partnerships 2017/2018 in Krasnodar at the end of June. 
It was, in a sense, he said “international understanding from the bottom up”. 
Since 2014, the Federal Foreign Office has been supporting civil-society cooperation in Russia and Eastern Partnership countries to the tune of fourteen million euros annually for hundreds of projects. 
Whilst the implementation of these human rights is primarily a matter for states, how it happens – on a public or private basis – is up to the states themselves. 
Much remains to be done 
Nonetheless, much remains to be done, particularly in this area. 
On 12 July, Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth participated in the Western Balkans Summit, which was attended by the region’s Heads of State and Government as well as Foreign and Economy Ministers. 
The Ministers met in Trieste to discuss specific projects to enhance regional integration among the six Western Balkan countries, primarily with a view to improving their economic and social perspectives. 
Roth had just previously visited Belgrade and Skopje. 
He also met with his Serbian counterpart, Ms Jadranka Joksimovic. 
“With Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and my counterpart Jadranka Joksimovic, two pro-European politicians are in office who are both open to dialogue and highly committed to drawing Serbia closer to EU membership. 
an opportunity to mend fences with neighbours 
I am particularly pleased that the civil society representatives I met with share this view. 
It was high time for the strong emotions and political polarisation in the country to end and be replaced by constructive cooperation and a willingness to reconcile differences. 
Otherwise, the reforms that are urgently needed could not be implemented,” Roth said in an upbeat summary of his talks. 
“The world is not in a good state” (interview) 
Published in “FOCUS” on 15 July 2017. 
What would you call those who committed acts of violence during the G20 Summit? 
Dangerous criminals. 
Shouldn’t they be called terrorists? 
Participants in the Western Balkans Summit discussed specific projects to enhance regional integration 
After a period of deadlock and political crisis, the country once again has a government. 
“My impression of the first steps taken by the new government in Skopje is positive. 
The country once again has an opportunity to mend fences with its neighbours, draw closer to the EU and make progress with a view to promoting democracy and the rule of law. 
Looking at the outcome of the Summit, was it all worthwhile? 
The world is not in a good state. 
Why do we meet so often? 
Because we have so many problems. 
I would welcome more relaxed relations. 
But to achieve that, we need to solve the problem in Ukraine. 
The debate on Russia is extremely emotional. 
How can that be explained? 
Putin feels disappointed by the West. 
Liu was prevented from accepting the prize in Oslo due to his detention. 
His wife Liu Xia was also not granted permission to leave the country to attend the award ceremony. 
The German Government has been calling for the release of Liu Xiaobo for many years. 
We therefore want to support the region as it draws closer to the EU, with measures to promote regional cooperation, particularly regarding the establishment of infrastructure and networks. 
In Serbia, Roth congratulated new Prime Minister Ana Brnabic on her election and at the same time underscored that Germany will continue to support Serbia on its way into the EU. 
Western Balkan countries, for their part, need decisive reforms to strengthen the rule of law and democracy and to fight corruption. 
Furthermore, his meetings included talks with civil society representatives, in order to learn more about their expectations and hear their assessments. 
This included the offer to take in Liu Xiaobo and his family members and allow them to reside in Germany. Unfortunately, the Chinese side did not accept this offer. 
Do we need a new Ostpolitik? 
I was in Reykjavik recently. 
I don’t think this is realistic. 
Russia needs to exert its influence on the separatists and the US needs to exert its influence on Ukraine. 
Why the US? 
After all, this is a problem in the heart of Europe. 
These efforts were launched in 2014 together with the Western Balkans’ European partners, under the heading of the Berlin Process. 
Your question implies that I am not honest. 
Is it right to differentiate here? 
To say it’s no problem if Russian gas is transported in eastern European pipelines and generates revenue, but not okay if Russian gas is transported to Germany, France, the Netherlands or Austria in Russian pipelines? 
He went on to say that Germany does also expect Serbia to press ahead with swift implementation of rule-of-law reforms and to play a constructive role, as the largest Western Balkan country, with a view to national reconciliation and stabilisation. 
After all, young people in the Western Balkans do not want to remain divided. Instead, they are pinning their hopes on a common future in the European Union. 
Italy’s Foreign Minister said he might as well be howling at the moon as regards refugee policy 
because this has the same impact as his calls on the EU. 
How Europe is dealing with Italy is not okay. 
One was a 61-year-old who was sentenced to death in June 2005 by the Supreme Court for murdering and robbing four people in 1991 and 1992; the other was a 34-year-old, who was sentenced to death for murder and robbery in 2011. 
Yes, perhaps. 
But during that time we cannot leave Italy to cope with its problems on its own. 
At any rate, I’d prefer the latter outcome. 
The Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo, who was born on 28 December 1955, was a lecturer at Beijing Normal University and as of 2003 served as president of the Independent Chinese PEN Centre (ICPC). 
Liu Xiaobo was a strong proponent and co‑author of Charter 08, a manifesto published on 10 December – international Human Rights Day – in 2008. 
Charter 08 calls for fundamental democratic rights in China, such as the freedom of assembly, the freedom of expression, and the freedom of religion. 
Liu was taken into custody on 8 December 2008, two days prior to publication of the manifesto. He was officially arrested on 23 June 2009. 
Following his indictment that July, he was sentenced to eleven years in prison on 25 December 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” by the First Intermediate People’s Court in Beijing. 
On 10 December 2010, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded Liu the Nobel Peace Prize. 
In addition, ever since it learned of his wish to leave China for Germany and that he was ill, Germany has strongly advocated a humanitarian solution. 
Only in June 2017, while suffering from late stage liver cancer, was Liu Xiaobo taken to hospital. 
He died on 13 July 2017 in a hospital in Shenyang (Liaoning Province). 
We just have to be careful not to flatter these violent criminals by ascribing political motives to them. 
and that is the first step to justifying their violence. 
This can be a difficult task. 
The fact that Putin and Trump finally met in person is perhaps the greatest achievement of the Summit. 
US President Trump even managed to have the earlier decisions on free world trade watered down and to encourage Turkey to think about leaving the Paris Climate Agreement. 
And the meeting between the 20 largest industrialised nations reflects that state of affairs. 
And to do that, we need willingness on the Russian side. 
People either love Putin or they hate him. 
That doesn’t mean sharing or justifying these opinions. 
The EU negotiated an association agreement with Ukraine without consulting Russia. 
Why can’t we make a new attempt to work towards disarmament and arms control instead of engaging in a huge arms race? 
Although the signs aren’t encouraging at the moment, I am strongly in favour of a new Ostpolitik and a new policy of détente. 
Should the EU lift its sanctions against Moscow? 
The right approach would be to gradually remove the sanctions when some progress is made 
The US has a huge influence on Ukraine. 
Secretary of State Tillerson is doing good foreign policy work even if uncertainties remain about how things are coordinated with the White House. 
High praise, indeed! 
US foreign policy cannot be allowed to become an extension of US economic policy. 
But ask French, Austrian or Netherlands industry. 
They all want the project because Russia transports gas safely and inexpensively. 
My Austrian counterpart wants to build fences, the idea being to let the Italians see how they cope. 
Naturally, we need to take in some of the refugees in Italy who have a chance of being granted asylum. And all European countries need to play their part. 
And we need to ensure that there are stable state structures in Libya so that the scourge of people smuggling can be tackled. 
What is more likely? You will remain Foreign Minister or Martin Schulz will become Chancellor? 
We also have serious conflicts with the Americans that we are not sweeping under the carpet. 
We were able to pursue and convict the Red Army Faction terrorists during the 1970s as what they were – criminals. 
Unfortunately, you can already call it an achievement these days when Heads of State and Government meet for talks in the first place. 
Apart from that, I don’t see any tangible progress. 
But what I find much worse is that the world’s actual problems – war, civil war, famine, poverty, displacement and forced migration – hardly played a real role. 
Regardless of how it is set up, the fact is that we now need to make use of all available rule-of-law measures across Europe to identify the perpetrators and to ensure that what we witnessed in Hamburg cannot happen again in the future. 
I advise everyone to try to understand the other side’s point of view. 
That’s how he sees it. 
And as we know, such feelings usually hurt the most. 
in order to show that it is worthwhile moving towards peace. 
I for one am not happy to see the Americans withdrawing from global politics. 
A situation whereby Russia is forced into a corner by having its gas banned from Europe so Europeans have to buy gas from the US is not acceptable. 
But what needs to happen is obvious. 
That is simply a matter of fair play. 
But that will take years – assuming it’s even feasible in the first place. 
Sometimes you need to make sacrifices for a good cause. 
There can be no justification whatsoever for violence and terror. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the attack at the Lions’ Gate in Jerusalem 
We condemn this act in the strongest possible terms. 
We were deeply shocked by today’s attack on Israeli border police officers at the Lions’ Gate in the Old Town of Jerusalem. 
Interview with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel about the G20 Summit in Hamburg, a new policy of détente and European help for Italy in the refugee issue. 
Some people talk about “left‑wing activists”. 
The term “left‑wing activists” downplays their actions in an irresponsible way – 
The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has been calling on the responsible Federal Minister of the Interior from the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) to organise this for a long time. 
When it comes to Germany, both the Russians and the Turks feel disappointed in love. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (14 July) on the attack in the Old Town of Jerusalem this morning in which two Israeli police officers were killed and a third injured: 
We share the grief of the families of the officers who were killed in the attack and wish the injured officer a swift and complete recovery. 
It is the worst attack in years to be carried out in the immediate vicinity of the religious sites on Haram al‑Sharif/Temple Mount and is all the more despicable for casting a dark cloud over the peaceful coexistence between worshippers of all three major monotheistic world religions in Jerusalem. 
Everyone must now do what they can to play their part in preventing escalation. 
Shouldn’t there finally be a list of extremists in Europe to prevent left‑wing extremists from travelling to Germany? 
I have advocated setting up a Europe‑wide task force without delay. 
Is a German‑Russian Spring in the air? 
Mr Gabriel, you have already met Vladimir Putin three times since you took office. 
But I also sense an equal amount of fondness for Germany among the Russians, and that is why I am saddened by these tense relations. 
That is where Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev talked for hours and agreed on a disarmament treaty from which we still benefit today. 
Chancellor Willy Brandt began his Ostpolitik in 1968 after the Soviet Union had invaded Czechoslovakia, in other words, during the most difficult times. 
Europe has said the Minsk Agreement must be implemented in full before the sanctions can be completely lifted. 
This will make the world even less safe. 
You recently accused the US of acting selfishly because its new sanctions against Russia hit Europe’s Nord Stream gas project. 
If you’re honest, isn’t part of your argument to do with the fact that Gerhard Schröder is Chairman of the Shareholders’ Committee of Nord Stream? 
As far as I’m concerned, we can also call them terrorists, as their aim is to spread fear and dread through terror. 
Federal Foreign Office on the second anniversary of the signing of the agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme 
the arrangements agreed upon have endured and Iran is continuing to meet its obligations. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (14 July) on the second anniversary of the signing of the Vienna agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme: 
Just like our partners, the German Government is very keen to see the Vienna agreement implemented unconditionally by all sides. 
The Vienna agreement is a key contribution towards nuclear non‑proliferation; it has brought more security to a region blighted by crises and conflicts. 
Despite all the tensions at present – also with Iran – today on the second anniversary of the signing we expressly welcome what the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed once again just a few weeks ago: 
Only if the agreement is fully implemented can it have a maximum impact and foster mutual trust. 
With the Vienna agreement of 14 July 2015, the E3+3 countries – Russia, China, the US, the UK, France and Germany – reached a consensus with Iran on a long‑term settlement of the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme, following more than a decade of contention. 
On 16 January 2016 (Implementation Day), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran had scaled back its nuclear programme as required. 
In return, the UN, US and EU lifted their economic and financial sanctions, as provided for in the agreement. 
The IAEA, which is responsible for monitoring the technical restrictions of the JCPoA with its unprecedented transparency regime, has confirmed in six quarterly reports, most recently on 2 June 2017, that Iran is, in principle, adhering to its undertakings.

Informing the world about Germany and conveying a positive image of the country 
How Germany ticks 
Since 17 July, the website has had a new look under the title “How Germany ticks”. 
The new website of the Germany platform 
Focus on 
“mobile first” and social media 
the water point project is supported by UNICEF 
Some things are non-negotiable: 
This is based on the premise that all human beings possess “inherent dignity and [...] equal and inalienable rights”, without distinction being drawn on any basis such as colour, gender, language or religion. 
However, campaigning for human rights is not only a moral and legal obligation under the Basic Law. 
Human Rights Report of the Federal Government 2016: Focus on civil societies 
Germany is a party to all major UN human rights conventions and their supplementary protocols, and reports at regular intervals to the relevant committees on the implementation of its obligations under these agreements. 
In favour of abolishing the death penalty worldwide 
Only the minimum norms enshrined under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are internationally binding. 
Germany is thus subject, on the one hand, to the strict international control exercised by the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, to which the States parties must submit regular reports on the national measures they have taken to comply with the Convention. 
On the other, it has committed itself to establishing a national preventive mechanism (NPM) as envisaged in the Optional Protocol. 
Europe – instruments to combat torture 
The Convention provided for the establishment of a committee of independent experts to review the human rights situation of individuals in States parties who have been deprived of their freedom. 
His mandate covers all countries, irrespective of whether a state has (yet) ratified the Convention against Torture. 
He reports on the situation in individual countries which he visits, like all Special Rapporteurs, at the country’s invitation, and draws public and media attention to specific urgent cases. 
An active civil society capable of action is a prerequisite for constructive relations between government and society. 
An active civil society capable of action is a prerequisite for constructive relations between government and society and for citizen-centred, development-oriented action by a state. 
Human rights, in turn, ensure the safe and positive conditions needed for civil-society engagement. 
Germany supports civil-society engagement and the work of human rights defenders and is committed to ensuring that scope is created and maintained for their activity. 
in order to make use of these major actors’ potential to effect transformation in our societies, there is also a need for a beneficial political climate, access to information, scope for participation in decision-making processes and long-term support in the form of (adequate) resources. 
Germany is worried to see governments trying to restrict, in some cases considerably, NGOs’ scope for action, for example through rules on their registration, ways of working and funding (particularly funding from abroad), or through the adoption of security legislation requiring monitoring, excessive data collection and privacy restrictions. 
Human Rights Report of the Federal Government 2016: Focus on civil society 
In many countries, civil society representatives working for the realisation of human rights are exposed to particular attacks, ranging from harassment and obstruction to torture, kidnapping and murder, by both state and private actors. 
These human rights defenders, including doctors, journalists, lawyers, judges, academics, trade unionists and the staff of human rights organisations, often take huge risks upon themselves in their efforts to spread the word about human rights, to defend the rights of individuals or to ensure that those who have committed human rights violations are punished. 
It can grant them funding via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) to support their work, enhance their capacities and, if necessary, ensure their temporary protection. 
In the autumn of 2015, an additional mechanism, also financed by the EIDHR – ProtectDefenders.eu – was set up to help human rights defenders at particular risk, and their families. 
Under this programme, the EU provides rapid assistance and support for human rights defenders working in remote areas and in countries where it is particularly dangerous to work in human rights defence. 
Economic, social and cultural rights: – An integral part of international law 
Be it access to decent work, safe drinking water and sanitation or adequate healthcare – 
The year 1966 saw, in parallel to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a universal and specific human rights instrument relating to ESC rights. 
164 countries have signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
For 50 years the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has been an integral part of international law and of the human rights policy debate on the same footing as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Both agreements require the States parties to respect the fundamental rights of the individual and to protect them against attack or interference by third parties. 
This applies to civil and political rights, which provide protection, for instance, against torture or restrictions of the right to freedom of opinion, and equally to ESC rights, such as the right to free choice of employment or protection against arbitrary removal from one’s home. 
People in Asore Kebele/Ethiopia filling canisters with water; 
It is frequently alleged that the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights – in contrast to civil and political rights – depends above all on the availability of sufficient resources and thus on a country’s level of development. 
And finally, when it comes to guaranteeing economic, social and cultural rights, e.g. the right to food or healthcare, it is not only and not primarily a matter of distributing as many resources as possible, but rather of ensuring access or participation without discrimination. 
The Federal Government has long been working for the realisation of ESC rights, too: the human right to water and sanitation, for example, or the right to adequate housing. 
The move towards global sustainable development and the eradication of poverty is reflected in the 2030 Agenda’s seventeen sustainable development goals, which are aimed primarily at promoting enhanced implementation of ESC rights. 
In 2008 the two countries succeeded in getting the UN Human Rights Council to mandate a Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
This independent expert helps to draw attention to specific issues and identify best practices and thus to clarify the content of these rights and how they can be met. 
Not least, the taboo surrounding the subject of sanitation needs to be removed, and there needs to be greater awareness about how to manage our finite water resources. Both these aspects are prerequisites for growth and prosperity and thus for a dignified life for all.

Competitors are not resting on their laurels 
Competition for the global public’s favour is getting stiffer. 
Cultural relations and education policy 
With its new design, the Germany platform is well equipped to meet this challenge. 
number among the Federal Foreign Office’s most important tasks. 
One of the most important instruments in this regard is the Germany platform. 
The new design has been optimised especially for Smartphone users in keeping with the “mobile first” principle. 
Germany regularly occupies top spots in surveys on the world’s most popular countries. 
The platform is to have an even stronger focus on social media. 
Behind this success lies the entire toolbox of cultural relations and education policy, which, alongside the Germany platform, includes the Goethe-Institut and German schools abroad. 
Many countries are investing ever-greater sums in strategic communication abroad. 
Both of these features support the objective of reaching particularly young people worldwide who could be interested in Germany. 
The aim here is to preserve and strengthen the positive image of the country, one that many people around the world already have today, in the long term. 
German Government policy guidelines: Preventing crises, managing conflicts, building peace 
How do we intend to deal with crises and conflicts around the world in future? 
This resulted in the German Government guidelines on preventing crises, managing conflicts, building peace. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel speaking to German police officers of the MINUSMA-UNPOL training mission at the National Police School in Bamako, the capital of Mali, on 7 April 2017. 
A military peacekeeping operation is of little use if there is no political process and if people have no hope that their country will develop in future. 
Peace, security and development are not isolated spheres – one cannot be advanced without the other. 
Together with the 2016 white paper, it forms the new strategic framework and compass for our actions. 
Guiding principles for peace policy 
What is more, there are hardly any crises nowadays which do not affect Germany at some point. 
Germany’s special responsibility for peace as a result of its history forms the foundation for the guiding principles for peace policy. 
Stabilising crisis-hit countries on a durable basis is therefore always in Germany’s interest. 
Priority for prevention and the primacy of politics 
Germany has been a State party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment since 1990 and to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture since 2009. 
For identifying and defusing conflicts before they flare up should be the focus of responsible foreign policy. 
Wherever possible, we place our faith in civilian instruments. 
The Federal Republic of Germany joined the Council of Europe initially as an associate member on 13 July 1950 and became a full member on 2 May 1951. 
Its currently 47 members include every country in Europe except Belarus and Kosovo. 
The institutions of the Council of Europe are 
the Committee of Ministers 
the Parliamentary Assembly 
the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities 
the European Court of Human Rights. 
The Committee of Ministers is the Council of Europe’s decision-making body and comprises the foreign ministers of all member countries, or their permanent diplomatic representatives in Strasbourg. 
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) is a forum for parliamentary debate. 
It is entitled to make recommendations and has a number of important decision-making powers. 
Its 324 seats are distributed among the national delegations of the Council of Europe’s member countries. 
The institutions of the Council of Europe are assisted by the Secretariat. 
Its core mission is to protect and promote human rights, as well as the rule of law and democracy throughout Europe. 
The PACE elects the Secretary General of the Council of Europe from a list of nominees drawn up by the Committee of Ministers, as well as the judges of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). 
The Lisbon Treaty provides for the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Work to this end is ongoing. 
Germany’s delegation is made up of 18 national parliamentarians and 18 substitutes. 
The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities (CLRA), which also has 324 seats, serves as the voice of the member countries’ regional and local politicians. 
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) is considered the Council of Europe’s flagship with direct relevance to Europe’s citizens. 
Individuals in Council of Europe member countries can, having been through their national courts, appeal directly to the ECHR if they believe their country has violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Since 1 October 2009, it has been headed by Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland, a Norwegian national. Jagland was elected for a second five-year term by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 24 June 2014. 
The Council of Europe has played a trailblazing role in creating a binding pan-European legal framework for the protection of human rights, the rule of law and democracy. 
An example of a partial agreement is the renowned European Commission for Democracy through Law, which is familiar to most as the Venice Commission, an institution of the Council of Europe that advises states on matters of constitutional law. 
The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Minority or Regional Languages are milestones in improving protection for minorities. 
Its mission is to promote local and regional democracy and strengthen local self-government and transfrontier cooperation. It also provides observers to monitor regional and local elections in member countries. 
Whether it be mediation, dealing with the past or humanitarian assistance, in most cases we can help in this way. 
Combat missions remain the last resort for the German Government. 
With a view to ensuring that the ministries involved cooperate even better in future, the German Government will strengthen its internal coordination. For only by working together can we make a difference. 
In Mali, for example, the diplomatic engagement, the Bundeswehr involvement in the UN and EU mission, as well as the development efforts are part of an overall political strategy. 
The aim is to foster reconciliation and to ensure the greater political participation of the north. 
Responsibility also means risk 
Six other countries hold observer status in the Council of Europe: 
Canada, the Holy See, Israel, Japan, Mexico and the United States. 
Promoting shared values 
The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress (Article 1 of the Statute of the Council of Europe). 
Conventions of the Council of Europe 
The more than 200 Council of Europe conventions and protocols now in effect include such groundbreaking instruments as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Anti-Torture Convention), the European Social Charter, the European Charter of Local Self-Government, the European Cultural Convention as well as the Conventions on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, on the Protection of Children and on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women. 
Council of Europe partial agreements 
Usually also third countries may accede to them. 
The Council of Europe and the EU 
The EU and the Council of Europe work closely together and continue to expand their cooperation. 
Flags of the OSCE and its 57 participating States 
The OSCE’s decisions are reached by consensus, i.e. with the approval of all participating States, and are not legally binding. 
Objectives of the OSCE 
These cooperation partners also attend meetings of the OSCE bodies. 
The OSCE applies a wide-ranging definition of security that encompasses what are known as the “three dimensions”: 
Core topics of the OSCE in the first dimension include disarmament, crisis management and counter-terrorism. 
The guidelines therefore also call for more realism and a greater willingness to take risks. 
for example, the German Government intends to refine its instruments of early crisis detection and to develop a strategy on how to strengthen the rule of law in order to foster peaceful coexistence. 
The German Government will also engage in an exchange with the Bundestag and citizens as well as with international partners on peace policy and present a comprehensive review after four years, that is to say in 2021. 
This comprehensive definition of security allows participating States to win back and build trust in the long term with overarching topics of mutual interest. 
The training programme is primarily geared to personnel to be deployed in peace missions of the UN, the EU and the OSCE. 
Since it was set up, just under 1800 German and international experts have completed ZIF courses for election monitoring and peace missions. 
In addition to general training of civilian peace experts, ZIF’s remit also includes recruiting specialists for specific missions and looking after them before, during and after the missions, as well as drafting independent analyses and providing advisory services and information on peace operations. 
Over the past ten years, ODIHR has conducted more than 200 such election observation missions. 
The results are released to the public in the form of reports. 
The first dimension, the politico-military dimension, comprises military and political cooperation as a core area of security policy, including arms control in particular, as well as crisis and conflict management. 
Detention of human rights defenders in Turkey 
We demand that he be released from prison without delay. 
Peter Steudtner has been remanded in custody in Turkey. 
Mr Steudtner is receiving consular assistance from the German Consulate General Istanbul. 
The German Government condemns the detention of Peter Steudtner and other human rights defenders in Turkey. 
The German Government is in regular and close contact with a large number of non-governmental organisations in Turkey. 
According to reports, the Turkish authorities have carried out an increased number of checks on non-governmental organisations in recent months. 
In some cases, international non-governmental organisations have been closed down in Turkey. 
It is absurd to accuse a defender and advocate of human rights and democracy such as Peter Steudtner of having links to supporters of terrorists. 
Amnesty International and other non-governmental organisations play an inestimably important role in fostering pluralism, democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey. 
We are not aware of a particular threat to Federal Foreign Office staff arising from the current political situation in Turkey. 
The exchange of information and military cooperation are intended to minimise the risk of conflicts. 
The second dimension, the economic and environmental dimension, provides a framework for discussions on issues such as combating money laundering, corruption and terrorist financing. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (18 July) on the detention of human rights defenders in Turkey: 
I assume that this ban will also be brought before the European Court of Human Rights. 
Prior to this, the Russian Ministry of Justice had called for the religious community to be prosecuted owing to allegations of “extremist activities” and the “propagation of extremist materials”. 
Members of the religion risk long prison sentences when continuing to practice their faith. 
Russia Coordinator Erler concerned about confirmation of court ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia 
In so doing, Russia is also, unfortunately, contravening its international obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. 
In its appeal ruling on 17 July 2017, the Russian Supreme Court upheld the judgement of 20 April ordering that the Administrative Center of Jehovah’s Witnesses and its regional institutions be liquidated. 
Federal Foreign Office summons Turkish Ambassador for a meeting 
The freedom of religion and thought is enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Russia has committed itself to upholding these rights. 
We will observe the further developments and consequences of this ruling for the Jehovah’s Witnesses very closely. 
The future of relations between Germany and the UK is in the hands of the youth of today. 
The German Government demands that Peter Steudtner be released immediately and that its consular staff be granted unrestricted access to him without delay. 
The representative of the Turkish Government has promised to convey this message immediately to the Turkish Government. 
That is absurd. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel has decided to cut short his holiday and return to Berlin. 
Exchange between young people, learning each other’s languages and knowing each other’s history will continue to play a crucial role in the shaping of our future bilateral relations. 
It was necessary to inform the Turkish Government directly, immediately and unambiguously about the German Government’s outrage and lack of understanding, as well as its crystal-clear views and expectations, in the case of Peter Steudtner – and to do so without using diplomatic pleasantries. 
This meeting has just taken place at the Federal Foreign Office. 
The Turkish Ambassador was told in no uncertain terms that the detention of Peter Steudtner and other human rights activists is incomprehensible, unacceptable and utterly inexplicable. 
The Turkish Ambassador is now aware that we mean business and that this matter cannot be postponed, but is of the utmost urgency. 
In consequence, our two Governments launched the UK-German Connection in the summer of 2005. 
In Germany, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth is responsible for youth exchanges outside of the school framework. 
It is now time to take the next steps together. 
We want to intensify our Governments’ efforts to increase exchange between our countries’ youngsters. 
With this in mind, we will this year double the funds available to the UK-German Connection. 
OSCE observers by the destroyed bridge in Sloviansk, Ukraine 
That is why the Turkish Ambassador was summoned this morning on the instructions of Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel to a meeting at the Federal Foreign Office. 
He will be in the Federal Foreign Office tomorrow morning to discuss what should now be done in view of the dramatic escalation of Turkey’s actions and what measures should now be taken. 
Germany and the UK are stepping up youth and school exchanges. 
The objectives of their project work include helping to ensure that human and minority rights are respected, assisting with building democratic and rule‑of‑law structures, fostering dialogue, especially between ethnic groups, creating modern societal and economic orders and helping to run elections. 
The missions are established by the OSCE Permanent Council, i.e. with the agreement of all OSCE participating States and in consultation with the host countries. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his British counterpart Boris Johnson spoke in London in April about the need to enhance efforts in this field. 
Despite our appeals on a number of levels, this move makes the peaceful enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and thought a criminal offence. 
This has now opened the floodgates to the criminal prosecution of members of this religious group exercising the right to the freedom of religion and thought, rights that are enshrined in the Russian constitution. 
Prior to the ruling, the Federal Government had, together with partners in the EU, called for the right to religious freedom in Russia to be respected. Moreover, EU representatives observed the trial in the court room. 
As part of the PeaceLab process, the Federal Foreign Office organised a lively debate among experts from ministries, the research sector and NGOs, as well as members of parliament and interested citizens. 
Gernot Erlot, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (19 July) on the Supreme Court’s ruling against the Jehovah’s Witnesses religious community in Russia: 
I am very concerned by the fact that the court ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia has been upheld. 
The two ministers thus stated in their declaration that they would double the funds available to the UKGC and further intended to promote the consolidation and expansion of these links. 
Germany and the UK: bilateral relations 
Declaration by Foreign Ministers Gabriel and Johnson on UK-German youth exchange 
Our relations rest on shared European values and a spirit of cooperation which have matured over the decades. 
The centrepiece of these relations is formed by fruitful and diverse contacts in the economic, educational and cultural spheres, a broad network of civil society links, and personal and professional ties. 
This bilateral initiative has established itself as a key body for the coordination of all aspects relating to bilateral youth and school exchanges. 
Thousands of young people from Germany and the UK have availed themselves of the opportunity to visit fellow youngsters in the other country, to learn their language and to foster understanding about the way they live. 
That is why the German Government, under the auspices of the Federal Foreign Office, has drawn up an overall interministerial concept on dealing with international crises and armed conflicts: the guidelines on preventing crises, managing conflicts, building peace. 
It is the aim of both countries to enable a significantly larger number of young people and teachers to profit from future exchange programmes, to strengthen cultural ties and to promote language learning. 
The guidelines contain a clear commitment on the part of the German Government to always give priority to civilian instruments as well as our stated desire to prevent crises. 
We consider our increased commitment to intensified exchange between young people and school pupils as a long-term investment in a peaceful Europe, in our security and in our prosperity – as friends and partners in Europe. 
For only if the roots of the problem are tackled can a conflict be resolved on a lasting basis. 
The UK-German Connection, the only youth exchange office in the UK to date with any other European country, is to receive additional support to ensure it has the capacity to make an even more lasting contribution to dialogue and exchange between young people from Germany and the UK. 
However, experience in Afghanistan and Iraq has also shown that crises take anything but a linear course. 
Crisis geography is much more complicated than that. 
With the aim of promoting peace and being able to develop tailor-made and centrally coordinated crisis strategies, back in 2015 the Federal Foreign Office brought together the spheres of crisis prevention, stabilisation, post-conflict peacebuilding and humanitarian assistance in a new Directorate-General S. 
Germany was able to achieve steps towards improving the humanitarian, economic and security situation in eastern Ukraine during its Chairmanship. 
The economic and environmental dimension primarily seeks to promote good framework conditions for security and stability in the economic realm. 
Germany hosted the 2016 OSCE Ministerial Council in Hamburg (9 December 2016) 
Germany therefore hosted the annual OSCE Ministerial Council, which took place in Hamburg. 
ZIF has trained civilian personal for international missions since 2002, an area that was previously the purview of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Election observation The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), based in Warsaw, regularly conducts election observation missions in all OSCE participating States. 
Not only the events of the election day and vote counting are taken into consideration, but the election period and election law are also monitored. 
The OSCE’s arms control is based on what are known as confidence- and security-building measures (CSBM), which are developed by the Forum for Security Co-operation. 
With good governance and connectivity, this was also one of the focuses of the German OSCE Chairmanship in 2016. 
The RFoM contacts the participating State in question and other parties directly in order to prevent possible restrictions to the freedom of the media at an early stage. 
The OSCE’s field missions and project offices report regularly to the OSCE Permanent Council from Ukraine, Moldova and Tajikistan, for example, and are able to provide an objective and nuanced picture of the situation on the ground. 
As a rule, the missions have between five and forty international and other local employees. 
OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine 
This unarmed mission primarily observes the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, including with mobile patrols, drones and video surveillance, and reports from throughout the country as an independent observer. 
Austrian diplomat Martin Sajdik, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, attends the Trilateral Contact Group (comprised of a representative from Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE respectively). This group provides the framework for negotiating the details of implementing the Minsk agreements. 
Accusations of links to terrorist organisations have clearly been invented – that is, unless one wishes to classify Amnesty International and other human rights organisations as terrorist organisations. 
In 2004, President Köhler of Germany and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II expressed their shared wish to revitalise contacts between young people and school pupils and recalled in that connection the pledge enshrined in our Cultural Convention of 18 April 1958 to promote youth exchange. 
Our sincere thanks go to all those who have worked so tirelessly on this project, including staff at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for Education and the British Council, on the part of the UK, and the Educational Exchange Service of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the German Länder on behalf of Germany. 
In addition, we will consolidate the institutional framework of the UK-German Connection so that it can continue to function as a central coordinating agency in the long term. 
Joint declaration by Sigmar Gabriel, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, and Boris Johnson, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on expanding UK-German youth and school exchanges: 
It is thus crucial to give as many young people from our two countries as possible the chance to get to know their peers in the other country in order to foster mutual understanding.

On 17 and 18 July, Andreas Peschke, Director for Eastern Europe at the Federal Foreign Office, and his French counterpart Florence Mangin visited the Belarusian capital Minsk.

The Franco-German delegation emphasised that, at the top-level EU meeting with its eastern neighbours in November, the focus will have to be on achieving concrete results for the citizens such as economic cooperation, education cooperation and youth exchange. 
They welcomed Belarus' readiness to be actively involved in preparations for the summit. 
He remembered the victims of this horrendous crime and emphasised that Germany will always recall its historic responsibility for the National Socialist atrocities committed in Belarus. 
They encouraged the Belarusian Government to take more steps to liberalise the country both in social and economic terms. 
The recent meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly held in Minsk from 5 to 9 July, also attended by Members of the German Bundestag, was a positive signal. 
For him, this demonstrates the interest of German businesses to engage in Belarus once the legal and economic conditions improve further. 
They underscored the EU position that more steps should be taken in the field such as implementing the OSCE recommendations on electoral reform, allowing peaceful protest or putting in place a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty. 
Belarus is now the only country in Europe in which the death penalty is handed down and carried out. 
These and other topics feature regularly on the agenda of the Human Rights Dialogue between the EU and Belarus of which the next session is to be held in Brussels on 20 July.

It is only possible to have a positive influence by accepting that there will be setbacks and that there are no guarantees of success. 
To this end, a host of follow-up processes are proposed in the document:

Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the situation in Turkey 
I will of course also phone my colleague Horst Seehofer later on. 
And yet special units of the Turkish police including special prosecutors burst into the seminar on 5 July and arrested all ten participants for supporting terrorism. 
These allegations are clearly unfounded and have been invented. 
Peter Steudtner has become just one of 22 German nationals to have been imprisoned for political reasons in Turkey since the attempted coup, which fortunately failed. 
In each case, we have had to fight for consular access, which is a right guaranteed under international law. 
Despite all the obstacles and difficulties, we have always been able to take it for granted that 
They are our citizens. 
Time and again, we have been disappointed. 
What is happening in Turkey is blatantly obvious. 
So Martin Schulz is right – 
things cannot go on this way. 
We cannot continue as before. 
We need to be clearer than we have been so that those responsible in Ankara understand that this type of policy will have consequences. 
We need to think about whether we should cap Hermes export credit guarantees. 
We will need to discuss this in the coming days and weeks with our European colleagues. 
The new travel and security advice is available on the Federal Foreign Office website. 
That is why I am in complete agreement with him. 
We demand the release of Peter Steudtner, Deniz Yücel and Meşale Tolu, unlimited consular access, and swift and fair trials for them and the other Germans accused of political crimes. 
Relations with Turkey are very important to us. 
We want Turkey to remain part of the West. 
However, it takes two to tango. 
At the moment, I do not see any willingness on the part of the Turkish Government to take this path with us. 
More’s the pity! 
Federal Foreign Office summons Turkish Ambassador for a meeting (press release of 19 July 2017) 
Travel and security advice for Turkey 
Naturally, this also affects the question of how we deal in Europe with the EU’s pre-accession assistance to Turkey. 
The OSCE in Ukraine is also represented by a Project Co‑ordinator’s office in Kyiv (PCU). 
The OSCE’s work in Ukraine The largest mission currently is the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, which comprises 1082 employees (of whom 651 are international observers from 44 participating States – as of June 2017). 
The third dimension, the human dimension, comprises activities in the area of freedom of the media, minority rights, tolerance, non‑discrimination, the rule of law and combating anti‑Semitism, which are indispensable elements of the OSCE’s comprehensive definition of security. 
The OSCE currently has 14 field missions in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine (2) and Uzbekistan. 
The Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE) is the largest regional security organisation in the world. Its 57 participating States comprise the countries of Europe and the successor states to the Soviet Union, as well as the United States, Canada and Mongolia. 
I discussed what I am about to tell you with the Chairperson of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the Chairperson of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) this morning because naturally we wanted to agree with the heads of the SPD and CDU on what steps we are going to take in the Federal Foreign Office and to act in concert with the coalition government. 
You can take it that everything I tell you now has been agreed both with Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz. 
It was established in 1975 with the Helsinki Final Act, and was initially called the Conference on Security and Co‑operation in Europe (CSCE). 
The OSCE was given its current name on 1 January 1995. 
1. the politico‑military dimension, 2. the economic and environmental dimension, and 3. the human dimension of security policy. 
In 2016, Germany held the Chairmanship of the OSCE, which rotates annually. 
Priorities of its Chairmanship included counter‑terrorism, economic connectivity and tolerance and diversity. Germany held a conference on each of these topic areas during its Chairmanship. 
Germany is chairing the Contact Group with the Asian Partners for Co‑operation until the end of 2017. 
Peter Steudtner travelled to Turkey at the beginning of July to take part as a consultant in a seminar organised by a human rights organisation on an island off Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara. 
Germany contributes just under 11 percent of the current OSCE budget, which makes it the second‑largest contributor behind the United States. 
The German Government also makes additional voluntary contributions to OSCE projects throughout the OSCE region. 
German staff are to be found in almost all the OSCE long‑term missions and institutions. All in all, Germany seconds more than 70 experts to the OSCE. 
Furthermore, Germany regularly contributes 10 percent, sometimes up to 15 percent – which is the limit prescribed by the OSCE – to the election observation missions run by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). 
Secondment of personnel is organised in cooperation with ZIF, the Center for International Peace Operations. 
The seminar was about cyber-security and how to deal with sensitive data about victims of human rights abuses. 
The OSCE also supports the implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) and the Open Skies Treaty. 
The position of Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities (CoEEA), who chairs an annual implementation meeting, was established in 1997. 
Peter Steudtner is not an expert on Turkey. This was his first-ever visit to the country. He has never written anything about Turkey. He does not have close contacts with Turkish politicians, the opposition or civil society, and he has certainly never come to anyone’s attention as a critic of the conditions in Turkey. 
The third dimension comprises the protection of human rights as well as the promotion of democratic and rule‑of‑law standards. 
Nine Germans are still on remand in Turkey. 
We regard their detention as excessive and illegal. 
German-Turkish relations have been under a great strain in recent times. 
In the past decades, there have been many good times, as well as not so good times, and misgivings, misunderstandings and prejudices exist on both sides to this day. 
Beyond its participating States, the OSCE conducts a dialogue with partner countries in the southern Mediterranean region (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Jordan) and with Asian partner countries (Japan, South Korea Thailand and Afghanistan), as well as Australia. 
there is a willingness to work together in a spirit of partnership and to do so on the basis of shared European values and the firm belief on both sides that the Turkish leadership sees itself as a member of the European family, also from a historical point of view, in NATO and in Turkey’s relations with the European Union and Germany. 
And this was not based on blind confidence or naivety, but rather the conviction 
Time and again, we have trusted that reason will prevail again and that we will find our way back to thriving relations. 
We are grateful to them for the contribution they have made and continue to make to our country’s development and prosperity. 
The cases of Peter Steudtner, Deniz Yücel and Meşale Tolu stand for the ludicrous accusations of “terror propaganda” that clearly serve to silence all critics one can catch, including those from Germany. 
And they stand for the injustice that can befall anyone. 
I regard the following points as the most important. 
One cannot advise anyone to invest in a country if there is no longer legal certainty there and even companies are being accused of supporting terrorists. 
For this reason, I do not see how we as the German Government can continue to guarantee German corporate investments in Turkey, if – as has happened – arbitrary politically motivated expropriations are not only a threat, but have actually occurred. 
As regards investment loans from development banks such as the EIB, we now need to take a very close look at what is and isn’t possible. 
Peter Steudtner’s case shows that German citizens are no longer safe from arbitrary arrest in Turkey. 
SPD Chairperson Martin Schulz has also commented on topics such as the Customs Union – an interest that is of great importance to Turkey and at the heart of its own interests as regards the European Union. 
And I must say frankly that I, too, cannot imagine negotiations on expanding the Customs Union taking place if citizens of the European Union are being detained in prison at the same time and for no reason in Turkey. 
We urgently call yet again on the Turkish Government to return to a respectful dialogue on the basis on European values. 
We expect Turkey to return to European values and to respect for freedom of opinion, the press and the arts. 
We remain interested in good relations with the Turkish Government based on trust. 
Following what felt like two endless weeks in police custody, Peter Steudtner and five other participants of the seminar have now been remanded in custody on the same charges. 
Particularly because we are aware of the sensitivities and disappointments in Turkey as regards the protracted process of EU accession and the failed military coup, our priority has always been partnership and the willingness to engage in dialogue, as well as patience with our Turkish friends and NATO partners, even if this has not always been easy for us. 
that we need to do this because we want to prevent bridges from being burned and our shared interests from being harmed, not least for the millions of people of Turkish origin who have found a new home in Germany and who must not be allowed to end up between a rock and a hard place. 
Time and again, we have been patient, have held back and not retaliated in kind. 
Over and over, the next stage of escalation was scaled. 
Someone who dismisses hundreds of thousands of civil servants, soldiers and judges, throws tens of thousands of people, including members of parliament, journalists and human rights activists, in prison, robs thousands of people of all their worldly goods by means of expropriation, closes down hundreds of press organisations, accuses dozens of German companies en bloc of helping terrorists – and by the way does all this on unfounded grounds and without respecting the fundamental principles of the rule of law – and is now pleading the case for the death penalty clearly wants to turn back the tides of time and to destroy the foundations of the rule of law and democracy that had only become so stable in recent years. 
Someone who detains law-abiding visitors to their country on the basis on outlandish, indeed absurd, accusations and throws them into prison has left European values behind. 
By the way, I also believe they have left behind what NATO has always aimed to be an alliance of values. 
That is why we will now need to look at how we adapt our policies on Turkey to this more tense situation. 
As a result, we have no other choice but to change our travel and security advice for Turkey and to inform Germans about what can happen to them if they travel to Turkey. 
Focus on common foreign policy 
to talk about the political crisis in Libya, the EU-led missions in the Mediterranean and relations between the EU and North Korea. 
Resolving the political crisis in Libya 
The conference room 
Europe as an actor in foreign and defence policy 
Within the scope of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the participants in the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to extend the EU Border Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya) until 31 December 2018. 
This mission cooperates with the Libyan authorities on border management. 
Clear stance on North Korea 
European flag 
The Foreign Affairs Council condemned North Korea’s latest missile tests, 
Ignoring several UN Security Council resolutions, North Korea most recently fired a ballistic missile on 4 July. 
The Council also endorsed restrictions on the export of inflatable boats (dinghies) and outboard motors with the aim of making it harder for smugglers to operate in the region. 
New EU civilian mission in Iraq 
Also on Monday, the Council adopted a crisis management concept for a new civilian CSDP mission in Iraq. 
This mission is intended in particular to help the Iraqi authorities to implement the civilian aspects of the Iraqi security strategy. 
EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels: 
The EU Foreign Affairs Council met in Brussels on 17 July 
The EU Foreign Affairs Council met in Brussels on Monday (17 July) 
The EU Foreign Ministers also laid the foundations for a new mission in Iraq within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). 
Looking to the situation in Libya, the representatives of the EU member states emphasised that stability could not be achieved in the crisis-torn country through the use of force. 
They reaffirmed their support for the Government of National Accord under Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, which is recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate government. 
At the same time, they welcomed Ghassan Salamé’s nomination as the new Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General. The Special Representative is to play a mediation role in efforts to reach political agreement in Libya. 
In this context, the Council also discussed extending the EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia, 
a naval operation intended to combat smuggling in the southern Mediterranean. 
So that the mandate for the mission can be extended, outstanding points are to be clarified by the end of the month. 
saying they violated international law and represented a serious threat to international security. 
The EU Foreign Affairs Council urged North Korea to refrain from any further provocative action. 
The EU supports South Korea in building a credible dialogue with North Korea and envisages confidence-building measures. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the murder of Israelis and the violence in East Jerusalem and the West Bank 
There can be no justification for violence against people. 
We share the grief of the victims’ families. Our thoughts are with their relatives. 
We condemn the perfidious murder of three members of an Israeli family in the occupied West Bank. 
We also condemn the violent clashes that claimed three lives and injured many people and have shaken East Jerusalem and other towns in the West Bank. 
The worldwide proliferation of missile systems – especially ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction – threatens regional stability and global security. 
Medium-range missile is launched 
Increasing numbers of countries are becoming capable of developing missile systems. 
EU and Federal Government activity 
Through both EU and bilateral channels the German Government is striving to persuade non-subscribing States of the HCoC’s merits. 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson commented today (21 July) on the situation in eastern Ukraine: 
Worrying reports are reaching us from eastern Ukraine – not for the first time, unfortunately. 
The agreed ceasefire is not holding. 
We are still seeing numerous instances of weapons being used along the contact line. 
Every day further victims are claimed in eastern Ukraine, both from the two parties to the conflict and from the civilian population. 
Similar casualty figures can be assumed on the separatists’ side. 
At the Normandy format meetings, both sides – Moscow and Kyiv – have pledged on several occasions to use their influence to ensure that the agreements on a ceasefire and on the withdrawal of heavy weapons are at last implemented. 
After a brief calming of hostilities, we have to say that 
it appears as though the parties to the conflict lack the will to ensure a lasting ceasefire. 
We urgently call on all parties to implement the agreements reached immediately. 
Lip-service will not get us anywhere. 
What eastern Ukraine needs, at long last, is visible progress towards peace. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (22 July) on the murder of three Israeli citizens in the Halamish settlement in the occupied West Bank and the violent clashes in East Jerusalem and towns in the West Bank in which three Palestinians were killed and dozens injured: 
We call on all sides to play their part in de‑escalating the situation and not to allow those who call for or accept violence to dominate the discourse. 
It is vital to keep the channels of communication open and to give the parties space to reach a solution together that does justice to the security needs of all sides and the importance of the holy sites for the three monotheistic religions, while maintaining the status quo at Temple Mount/Haram al‑Sharif. 
The HCoC is the only multilateral arms control mechanism to date aimed at creating an inventory of missile holdings. 
So far, the HCoC has not been able to develop its full potential because major countries with access to missile delivery technology have not signed it. These include Brazil, China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 
Furthermore, Germany, within the framework of the EU, is promoting the HCoC’s internet-based information and communication mechanism (e-ICC), which facilitates secure and efficient communication between the signatory States. 
In future the Federal Government will continue to press for the full implementation, universalisation and ongoing development of the HCoC. 
An Immediate Central Contact (ICC) for the HCoC has been established at the Austrian Foreign Ministry: 
Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCoC) (PDF, 11 KB) 
At the same time, the development, acquisition, possession and transfer of such military technology is not yet regulated by international law. 
Against this backdrop, the aim of the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCoC), which is not binding under international law, is to curb the proliferation of ballistic missiles. 
The HCoC does not prohibit or restrict possession of military missile delivery technology, but does, however, require compliance with certain principles and confidence-building measures. 
The positive development of the reporting conduct of HCoC signatory States in recent years is currently stagnating at a high level. 
With 14 Ukrainian soldiers killed and 13 injured, the fighting has claimed a particularly high number of victims in recent days. 
We have seen several attempts at this, most recently with a ceasefire for the harvest season in place since 24 June. 
Otherwise they are risking an escalation of the military conflict, many more deaths and a complete halt in the political process. 
What the Council of Europe does. 
Human rights protection in the Council of Europe 
European Court of Human Rights 
Germany is working intensively on the Council of Europe’s programmes at all levels and is also supporting efforts to reform the organisation. 
Germany has 18 seats in both the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. 
The Federal Government maintains an intensive dialogue with the Council of Europe at the political level. 
Partial agreements 
The Lisbon Treaty provides for the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. 
The HCoC was opened for signature in the Hague in 2002. To date, 138 states have acceded to it, most recently India in June 2016. 
The HCoC mainly prescribes transparency measures, particularly Pre-Launch Notifications (PLN) of missile launches and annual declarations on national missile policies. 
Furthermore, the HCoC contains a voluntary commitment by signatory States to curb the proliferation of military delivery systems through multilateral, bilateral and national measures. 
At the 16th HCoC annual Regular Meeting in Vienna in May 2017, the Federal Government appealed to delegates to drive forward steps to promote the universal validity of the HCoC and the intensification of HCoC mechanisms.

The German Government considers the Council of Europe to be an indispensable institution for the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and democracy throughout Europe and as a forum for the creation of a uniform European legal area. 
Germany also makes voluntary contributions, for example to promote human rights projects. 
In October 2016, then Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and addressed the Parliamentary Assembly. 
Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (25 July) on the dismissal of the trial against Valentina Cherevatenko, human rights activist and head of the non-governmental organisation Women of the Don Union: 
The dismissal of the trial is good news for cooperation between our two countries’ civil societies. 
If convicted, she would have faced a prison sentence of up to two years. 
Cherevatenko takes part in the civil society working group of the Petersburg dialogue. 
A German partner organisation has secured Eastern Partnership funding for a Ukrainian‑Russian dialogue project that the NGO Women of the Don Union is supposed to help implement. 
Statement by Russia Coordinator Erler on the dismissal of the trial against human rights activist Valentina Cherevatenko 
The German Government has repeatedly lobbied the Russian side on behalf of Valentina Cherevatenko. 
I welcome the Russian authorities’ dismissal of the trial against renowned civil society activist Valentina Cherevatenko, who was awarded the Franco-German Prize for Human Rights in 2016. 
The winner of the 2016 Franco-German Prize for Human Rights was accused of having cooperated with a German foundation on one of her projects, without voluntarily registering the Women of the Don Union as a “foreign agent”. 
On 22 June 2016, criminal proceedings were launched under “foreign agents” legislation (Article 330.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) against Valentina Cherevatenko, head of the NGO Women of the Don Union.

Since 2013, cooperation has been based on the Federal Government strategy for one-stop international cooperation in vocational education and training. 
As one of the four core ministries – alongside the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy – the Federal Foreign Office is responsible for the coordination of the various activities undertaken in other countries. 
Since 1949, the Council of Europe has been working to promote the rule of law and protect human rights and democracy throughout Europe.

Germany’s role in the Council of Europe 
As one of the six main contributors alongside Britain, France, Italy, Russia and Turkey, Germany provides some eleven percent of the Council of Europe budget (total volume of the Council of Europe regular budget in 2017: approx. 253 million euros).

Partial agreements are a special form of close thematic cooperation by some or all member states. 
The EU provides the Council of Europe with considerable funds to implement joint projects aimed at protecting and promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy in Council of Europe member states as well as in Europe’s southern and eastern neighbourhood. 
Council of Europe website 
Various federal ministries as well as the Länder, business associations and German chambers of commerce abroad, companies and other private providers have launched programmes and are implementing them in the various partner countries. 
Germany actively promotes United Nations human rights activities 
The Human Rights Council is the key forum in the United Nations for ensuring that these agreements are observed. 
Furthermore, the Human Rights Council can launch special procedures, focusing either on the situation in a particular country or on a specific international human rights issue, and appoint a special rapporteur or a group of independent experts to deal with these matters. 
During its membership, Germany is working to raise the profile of the Council as a central body and early-warning mechanism for the international protection of human rights. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (19 July): 
It is equally incomprehensible that journalists are being equated with terrorists, as the Turkish judiciary is doing – apparently at the political orders of the Turkish Government – in the cases of Deniz Yücel and Meşale Tolu. 
Based in Geneva and New York, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) helps the High Commissioner to fulfil his or her mandate and provides guidance and technical support to governments, national human rights institutions and NGOs. 
Human rights in the United Nations 
Abstimmung … Voting in the Human Rights Council © OHCHR Geneva 
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which were adopted in 1966 and entered into force in 1976, were further milestones as regards ensuring binding protection for human rights under international law. 
The Human Rights Council 
It helps member states to uphold human rights, deals with human rights violations and draws up recommendations for the further development of international law in the field of human rights. 
Germany was a founding member of the Human Rights Council. In October 2015, it was elected to the Council for the third time by the General Assembly for the 2016 to 2018 term. 
In 2015, the Human Rights Council was chaired by Ambassador Joachim Rücker, who was Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Office of the United Nations and to the other international organisations in Geneva at the time. 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
Germany used this position to enhance civil society’s role in the Council, boost the Council’s efficiency and effectiveness, and improve the Council’s links with other parts of the United Nations system. 
The position of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was established by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993. Since then, the High Commissioner has led on human rights issues in the United Nations system. 
Promoting and networking: 
“Afrika kommt!” 
Young talents from all sectors 
With engineers from Ghana, molecular biologists from Uganda and bankers from Nigeria, 
the programme’s participants hail from the most diverse business sectors and regions of Africa. 
In the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Human Rights Council examines the human rights situation in each United Nations member state at five‑yearly intervals. 
The High Commissioner reports directly to the Secretary‑General of the United Nations. He or she can put violations of human rights worldwide on the General Assembly’s agenda and is responsible for joining up all of the United Nation’s human rights activities. 
The programme is conducted by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and is supported by the Federal Foreign Office. 
The young professionals selected are among the best in their sector. 
With their knowledge, intercultural competence and their contacts, they become valuable bridge-builders between Germany and Africa thanks to “Afrika kommt!”. 
With this initiative, German companies are fostering young talents from African business with a one-year stay in Germany. 
The aim was to create a training programme that promotes African talents while at the same time building bridges between the German and African economies. 
Working for a German company or non-governmental organisation lies at the heart of the programme. 
Participants and companies are able to remain in touch after the training year thanks to a close alumni network. 
“Afrika kommt!” has now become established as one of the most renowned funding programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
with over 6000 people applying for the 30 places available. 
Young African professionals are given a send-off at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Joining forces against arms and people smugglers – 
Combating people smugglers remains the priority 
Germany has been part of the operation since the beginning.

Working together on all levels 
The operation, which is led by Rear-Admiral Enrico Credendino of Italy, will also gather information on goods and oil smuggling in the future 
and share more information with the EU Member States’ law enforcement agencies, as well as with Europol and Frontex. 
In this way, the operation is helping to stabilise the country. 
A further aim of Operation SOPHIA is to implement the United Nations’ arms embargo against Libya on the high seas. 
A further aim is to improve monitoring of the effectiveness of the training provided. 
The German Bundestag had already agreed on 29 June 2017 to continue the participation of German armed forces in Operation SOPHIA until 30 June 2018.

Operation SOPHIA is part of an overall EU strategy 
Criminal smugglers base their business model on boat passengers being rescued by various actors. 
They put the lives of thousands of people in danger by transporting them on boats that are overcrowded, unseaworthy and woefully under-equipped. 
Combating people smugglers’ business model will thus remain Operation SOPHIA’s priority. 
with the aim of enabling it to rescue vessels in distress in accordance with international law and in line with international standards. 
Between the start of Operation SOPHIA in June 2015 and July 2017, the men and women deployed on Operation SOPHIA ships saved the lives of over 41,000 people in the Mediterranean Sea.

Operation SOPHIA is part of an overall EU strategy. 
Apart from combating smuggler rings, it addresses the structural causes of forced and irregular migration movements across the Mediterranean in the countries of origin and transit. 
The EU is also providing support to the Libyan Coastguard,

we will not back down. 
It comprises three phases. 
During the fifth class of “Afrika kommt!”, the young professionals experienced German companies, learned German and completed management training courses over the past 12 months. 
Nineteen German companies launched the programme in 2008. 
The participants spend a total of eight months at their respective guest institutions and are integrated into various work processes. They also attend intensive language courses and management training sessions.

The Programme, which is designed for senior diplomats from the G20 countries, serves as a dialogue-enhancing platform. 
Their hope, in 1975, was to thereby provide fresh stimulus for a new world economic order. 
These issues have remained highly topical and continue to be discussed today by the G20 nations. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the situation in Jerusalem 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (27 July) on the situation in Jerusalem: 
We call on all parties affected to continue their endeavours to achieve a sustainable solution that does justice to the security needs of all sides and the importance of the holy sites, while maintaining the status quo . 
Any call or statements that serve to fuel the situation would be irresponsible in this context. 
We have been observing the situation in Jerusalem in recent days with concern. 
On 25 July 2017, the Council of the European Union voted to extend the mandate of EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA until 31 December 2018. 
The German Navy and its European partners are working in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya to combat arms and people smuggling and are meeting their obligation under international law to carry out sea rescues. 
Over 41,000 lives have been saved 
In the future, Germany will continue to be active in this context and to work with its European partners in EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA.

In view of this, the German Government warmly welcomes the fact that constructive talks between Israel and Jordan have led to concrete steps to de-escalate the situation at Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. 
The latest developments give us reason to hope that worshippers will return and that Friday prayers will pass off peacefully tomorrow. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement today (26 July) on the sentence handed down to Vietnamese human rights activist Tran Thi Nga: 
“I was shocked by the very harsh sentence of nine years’ imprisonment handed down to Ms Tran Thi Nga by a court in Viet Nam. 
Amnesty International paid tribute to her work on International Women's Day this year. 
The Vietnamese Constitution also protects freedom of opinion and the press. 
Furthermore, with this step, Viet Nam is carelessly putting its reputation as a state open to reform and modernisation at risk. 
My thoughts are with Ms Tran’s family for whom this sentence is highly distressing.” 
Ms Tran’s husband and relatives were not allowed to attend the trial. 
More than just a plane: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel brings the plane back to Germany 40 years after its hijacking in what became known as the German Autumn. 
The plane, which has been decommissioned and is currently in Brazil, was purchased back in May. 
After its return, the aircraft will be displayed on the grounds of the Aviation and Aerospace Museum in Friedrichshafen. 
A symbol of a free society 
AM Rollfeld Mogadischu… May 2017: Foreign Minister Gabriel on the tarmac in Mogadishu. 
“The message of the Landshut is: 
We will not give in to terrorism. We are stronger.” 
… Landshut 1977 … The Landshut as hijacked by terrorists in 1977 
The Federal Foreign Office is bringing the Landshut, an ex-Lufthansa aircraft, home to Germany. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel declared, “The liberation of the Landshut is to this day a potent symbol of a free society which does not back down in the face of fear and terrorism.” 
The decommissioned Landshut today 
The idea is to explain the hijacking and rescue of the plane in their historical context. 
The Landshut will be collected from an airfield near the Brazilian town of Fortaleza and flown back to Germany in a transport plane. 
The aircraft remained in service for Lufthansa until 1985, and was thereafter used by various other airlines. 
It was most recently flown by a Brazilian carrier. 
The Landshut was hijacked in October 1977 by Palestinian terrorists with a view to demanding the release of imprisoned German RAF terrorists. 
Exhibition design 
Lufthansa experts will then restore the aircraft in Friedrichshafen. 
Due to her work, Ms Tran has on several occasions been targeted by the security forces. 
He went on to say that the Landshut was not just a plane, it was an inspiration. 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the sentencing of Vietnamese human rights activist Tran Thi Nga to nine years’ imprisonment 
Just like in the case of Mother Mushroom, a well-known Vietnamese blogger who was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment less than a month ago due to her work to promote human rights, this sentence contradicts the human rights principles recognised by Viet Nam and violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Viet Nam has acceded. 
The disproportionately harsh conviction runs counter to the reforms to promote the rule of law undertaken by the Vietnamese Government. 
Human rights activist Tran Thi Nga, born in Ha Nam province in northern Viet Nam on 28 April 1977, has four children (her two youngest children are only four and seven years old). 
She was arrested back in January 2017 (about three months after the arrest of the well-known blogger and activist Mother Mushroom). 
In a trial originally scheduled to last two days, she was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment and five years’ house arrest for "conducting anti-state propaganda" on 25 July. 
A display concept will be elaborated in Friedrichshafen in order to integrate the aircraft into the museum exhibition. 
Tran Thi Nga used peaceful means to combat corruption and arbitrary actions and assist victims of the justice system, promote employment rights and environmental protection. 
After a crazy journey through seven countries, the plane was retaken by Germany’s elite counter-terrorism unit GSG 9. 
GOVET – the German Office for International Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training 
the Landshut returns to Germany 
Ausbildung… Vocational training in the hospitality sector 
The German Office for International Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training (GOVET) is based at the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) in Bonn. 
Members of BIBB, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and the Federal Foreign Office work together at GOVET, 
In particular, interested parties from Germany and abroad can obtain information about the dual training system, German vocational training cooperation initiatives and potential cooperation partners. 
Enquiries from Germany and abroad 
The GOVET website also features a detailed country profile section and the international vocational training cooperation database. 
Furthermore, GOVET assists the political cooperation by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the sphere of vocational training, for example cooperation with six European countries with which Germany signed a declaration of intent in December 2012. 
Rosa Parks House in Berlin 
Federal Minister Gabriel visited the Rosa Parks House in Wedding at the end of June. 
She was awarded many prizes and honours in the US, and many streets and squares there are named after her. 
The bus in which she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger in Montgomery in 1955 is now in the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and was visited by President Obama in 2012. 
Rosa Parks lived in Detroit from 1957 to 1959. 
In the summer of 2016, her niece, Rhea McCauley, bought the house from the City of Detroit for 500 dollars, to prevent it from being demolished. 
She presented it to the artist Ryan Mendoza, who had it shipped to Berlin that same year. 
Mendoza is hoping to return the building to the US. 
He is appealing to official agencies in the US and to foundations to find a safe and appropriate site in which to exhibit the house. 
Ryan Mendoza (born 29 October 1971 in New York City) lives and works in Naples and Berlin. 
In his paintings, Mendoza combines the techniques of the Old Masters with contemporary themes. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (28 July) on the adoption of a law on sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea by the US Congress: 
Our offer to coordinate our policies towards Russia closely and in a spirit of mutual trust stands. 
That is the reason and the benchmark for our European sanctions – not more, but also not less. 
President Trump knows that, and so do the State Department and the US Administration. 
Sanctions policies are neither a suitable nor an appropriate instrument for promoting national export interests and the domestic energy sector.” 
It is good that Congress has now explicitly stipulated that consultations must be held with the United States’ European partners before further measures can be taken. 
We will continue to advocate joint action. 
“What happens next is now up to President Trump. 
we want to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
If the Russian leadership makes a move and we are finally able to make progress as regards implementing the Minsk agreements, it is also conceivable that these sanctions will be gradually eased. 
Our stance remains that we will not accept any extraterritorial use whatsoever of these US sanctions against European companies. 
We have already had a good dialogue with the US Administration for some time. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the adoption of a law on sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea by the US Congress 
We must not forget what is involved – 
There is consensus between us that this requires exerting political pressure on Moscow. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (29 July) on information about North Korea launching another intercontinental missile 
On behalf of the German Government, I condemn North Korea’s latest missile test in the strongest possible terms. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement before departing for Belgium: 
The United Nations Security Council shoulders particular responsibility. 
The European Union also made a clear commitment to this goal at the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 July. 
Europeans reached out their hand to us. 
Europe is a peace project. 
We can only safeguard our interests and defend our values if we stand united. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is representing the Federal Republic of Germany at the commemoration event in Ypres/Belgium on 31 July. 
North Korea must reach out to the international community and return to the negotiating table without delay. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on information about North Korea launching another intercontinental missile 
North Korea has again unscrupulously flouted international law and threatened regional and international peace. 
Germany is working for a tightening of sanctions against North Korea and for their consistent implementation. 
We must also insist that other key partners also implement the sanctions more efficiently. 
We need to close all the gaps. 
Never again may diplomacy fail the way it did in 1914; never again may there be war in the heart of Europe; never again may our continent’s young people be slaughtered! 
As a result, we Europeans achieved peace and reconciliation after two devastating world wars. 
Statement by Foreign Sigmar Minister Gabriel on 31 July on the commemoration of the start of the Third Battle of Ypres 
Like Verdun, the Third Battle of Ypres is a symbol of the futile brutality of war. 
When we remember the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who were slain in the trenches of Flanders over the course of just a few months, our joint message is “never again”. 
Never before in the history of our continent have more than 70 years – almost a human lifespan – passed without war and destruction. 
In a world full of crises and conflicts, it is more important than ever today to remember that Europe is far more than a single market. 
and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides. 
The Third Battle of Ypres (Battle of Passchendaele) during the First World War began on 31 July 1917 with attacks by the Allies on German positions around Ypres. 
The international community needs to provide a shared, clear response with a view to persuading North Korea to halt its illegal and dangerous missile launches and nuclear tests and to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Our priority is peaceful, stable co‑existence on a denuclearised Korean Peninsula.

Statement by a Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the situation in Venezuela 
The foreseeable escalation of violence claimed more than 15 lives this weekend. 
Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. 
We condemn the disproportionate use of violence by the security forces. 
This step has furthered divisions in the country, weakened the democratic order and aggravated the profound crisis that has shaken Venezuela for many months. 
The German Government regrets that President Maduro’s Government has not halted the process to establish a constituent assembly despite great resistance by Venezuelan society and against the explicit advice of the international community. 
The German Government does not regard the constituent assembly as a suitable means to lead Venezuela out of its economic and social crisis. 
As an urgent necessity, the Government must start serious negotiations with the opposition on a path out of the crisis and to this end accept the offers of mediation by countries from the region. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (31 July) on the situation in Venezuela: 
The international community’s continued aim must be to support the country in its search for a non‑violent solution to the political and economic crisis. 
In signing the treaty, the two countries are sending an important message as regards successful bilateral and regional cooperation in the Balkans and the further European-Atlantic integration of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
It is remarkable that this signature was achieved less than two months after the new Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia took office. 
There is still time. 
We will make the most of this opportunity. 
I am in close contact with Rex Tillerson on this issue. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on United States sanctions bill 
Participants spend time in Berlin, which as Germany’s present day capital represents Helmut Schmidt's time as a government minister and as Federal Chancellor. They also visit Hamburg, where Helmut Schmidt came from and spent most of his life, and which stands for his work as editor of Die Zeit newspaper. The third programme city is Paris, where Helmut Schmidt and Giscard d'Estaing put their stamp on Franco-German cooperation. 
The Helmut Schmidt Programme was inspired by the creed of Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who, as G7 founding fathers, sought to establish an informal forum for frank debate and for concerted efforts to solve international problems. 
The metamorphosis of the international system of the 21st century has also had an impact on the way diplomacy needs to be done. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (1 August) on the signing of a treaty on good neighbourliness between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 
“Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia signed an historic treaty on good neighbourliness in Skopje today. 
I very much welcome the achievement of consensus on outstanding questions, following many years of unsuccessful negotiations. 
I trust that the new Government in Skopje will continue to pursue this form of constructive cooperation with all neighbouring countries. 
I also welcome the endeavours by the new Government to finally launch the reforms urgently needed for EU accession, following years of standstill.” 
The treaty on good neighbourliness between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia removes Bulgaria’s concerns about the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining NATO and the EU. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the signing of a treaty on good neighbourliness between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
Encouraging participants to talk openly, informally, and even contentiously about global issues and crisis regions is very much the aim of the Programme. 
Personal contacts, as well as durable national and international networks which reach far beyond classical diplomatic channels to include civil society stakeholders, are becoming ever more important. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement to the Rheinische Post newspaper on the bill on sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea passed by the United States Congress last week: 
Evidently President Trump has not yet made any decision on whether or how he plans to tighten the sanctions on Russia. 
In any case, the bill provides for consultations with us Europeans before that can happen. 
We will voice our concerns very clearly. 
Our priority is to overcome the Ukraine crisis and to maintain the political pressure on Moscow that sanctions cause. 
That is only possible if we present a united front work together. 
And we will oppose an “America first” industrial policy under the pretext of sanctions. 
It was not in 1918, but rather only after 1945, that bitter enemies became close partners and good friends in the ruins of a destroyed continent. 
The battle ended on 6 November 1917 without notable gains 
Along with Germany, representatives of the countries that fought in the war – Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland, Malta, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom – are attending the commemoration event at the British war cemetery, Tyne Cot, near Ypres.

Travelling in the EU this summer? Thanks to Brussels, your journey has gotten easier! 
Thanks to these achievements by the European Union, some 500 million EU citizens can now travel with as much ease in many parts of Europe as in their own country. 
The EU has abolished roaming charges right in time for the start of the summer holidays. 
Consumers can now call, text and browse the internet on their mobile for the same price as at home all over the EU. 
Thanks to the EU, travel has become increasingly easy 
since the Schengen provisions abolished checks at 22 Member States’ internal borders, as well as for travel to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. 
Also, before the 1990s, mutual recognition of driving licences within the EU was not a matter of course. 
Today, this common practice enables EU citizens to drive in all Member States.

However, the euro, which is now legal tender in 19 EU Member States, has played the greatest role in making travel in the EU easier. 
Moreover, European regulations stipulate that cash withdrawal fees throughout the EU may not be higher than withdrawals from another bank in an EU resident’s home country.

It may still be expensive to call someone abroad, including if the call is made in another EU Member State.

Constructive cooperation with all neighbouring countries is important 
The treaty on good neighbourliness that has now been signed removes Bulgaria’s concerns about the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining NATO and the EU. 
With a view to the future, Gabriel said he trusted that the new Government in Skopje would continue to pursue this form of constructive cooperation with all neighbouring countries. 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will face great challenges in implementing these reforms. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel – treaty on good neighbourliness between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria sends an important message 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria signed a treaty on good neighbourliness on 2 August. 
“In signing the treaty, the two countries are sending an important message as regards successful bilateral and regional cooperation in the Balkans.” 
Nach der Unterzeichnung… After signing the treaty on good neighbourliness, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and his counterpart from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, gave a joint press conference. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel welcomed the achievement of consensus on outstanding questions, following many years of unsuccessful negotiations, 
Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia began negotiating a treaty on good neighbourliness in 1999. 
The German Foreign Minister also welcomed the endeavours by the new Government to finally launch the reforms urgently needed for EU accession, following years of standstill. 
The law enforcement agencies in Berlin are now also investigating the case. 
The abduction of Vietnamese citizen Trinh Xuan Thanh on German territory is an unprecedented and blatant violation of German and international law. 
The incident came to light thanks to the alertness of the German law enforcement agencies. 
An incident of this kind has the potential to affect relations between Germany and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in a very adverse way. 
He made it abundantly clear to the Ambassador that the German Government demands that Trinh Xuan Thanh be allowed to travel back to Germany immediately so that the application for extradition and the asylum application can be examined in full under due process. 
We also reserve the right to take further steps as required at the political, economic and development policy level.” 
Statement by Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on German‑Vietnamese relations 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement in Berlin today (2 August) on German‑Vietnamese relations: 
“Following ever‑greater evidence and now no reasonable grounds to doubt that the Vietnamese agencies and the Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in Berlin were involved in the abduction of a Vietnamese citizen in Berlin, Markus Ederer, State Secretary at the Federal Foreign Office, summoned the Ambassador of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam yesterday. 
It is also an extreme breach of trust – 
on the margins of the G20 Summit, high-level representatives of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam reiterated the request to extradite this Vietnamese citizen from Germany to Viet Nam. 
Markus Ederer, State Secretary at the Federal Foreign Office, expressed the German Government’s views on this in no uncertain terms to the Vietnamese Ambassador yesterday. 
As a consequence of this wholly unacceptable incident, the official representative of the Vietnamese intelligence agencies at the Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in Germany has been declared persona non grata and given 48 hours to leave Germany.

The remaining 2,897 women, men and children were murdered in the gas chambers. 
For this reason, chlorine gas, as opposed to the military warfare agent sarin or mustard gas, for example, is not included on the CWC’s lists of prohibited chemicals. 
The Syrian army and IS have deployed chemical weapons 
It’s the Open Day on 26 and 27 August 2017 at the Federal Foreign Office.

These 600 men, women and children, who included Otto Rosenberg and his family, were later transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where almost all of them were murdered. 
We will also be bringing bakers from around Europe onto the diplomatic stage, so that they can give you a taste of the Europe we are building. 
It launches an investigation as soon as the FFM has established that chemical weapons have been deployed. 
And yet it is part of Europe’s shared culture of remembrance, like the Shoah of the Jewish victims. 
In 2016, the JIM concluded that the Syrian army was responsible for the use of toxic chemicals in three out of nine meticulously investigated cases. 
However, commemorating and remembering are not enough. 
Furthermore, a mustard gas attack has been attributed to the terrorist organisation IS. 
Consequences of the use of chemical weapons 
Both the OPCW and the United Nations Security Council have categorically condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria in the strongest possible terms and appealed for those responsible to be brought to justice. 
However, as Russia does not recognise the findings of the JIM investigations, the United Nations Security Council has not been able to agree to impose sanctions on Syria to date. 
You are invited to join in a dialogue on 
Russia and China have used their vetos to block resolutions to this end.

2017 intergovernmental negotiations on development cooperation with SADC 
The development negotiations between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Federal Republic of Germany, which are held every two years, were successfully concluded in Berlin on 28 June 2017. 
Ambassadors and representatives of the embassies of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe also took part in the negotiations. 
Additionally, up to 30 April 2015, approximately 370 tons of mustard gas remnants from Syria were incinerated in an environmentally safe process by the publicly owned disposal company GEKA. 
Furthermore, German laboratories are frequently involved in the testing of chemical weapon samples from Syria. 
Among other things, the focus is on creating an environment conducive to business and investment. 
For more information about the current situation in Syria and the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, click here (OPCW website). 
Background: 
This is also the purpose of continued cooperation in the priority areas of regional economic integration, cross-border water management and natural resource management, including enhancing climate change resilience. 
Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on 14 September 2013. 
Following decisions reached by the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the chemical weapons declared by Syria were removed from Syria by sea by June 2014 to be destroyed outside Syria. This task was completed by the end of 2015. 
Without you, we would not be here today. 
Statement by a Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on Khan Shaykhun of 30 June 2017 
Without you, we would not have this memorial. 
There is still so much to do. 
There is still a lack of awareness that Sinti and Roma have not only been part of Europe and part of our societies for centuries, 
but have also influenced and enriched us. 
A sum of 47.5 million euros in funding has been pledged for the years 2016-17, taking the total amount made available to SADC since the 1990s to around 400 million euros. 
It is a wonderful project that fills us all with pride. 
Strengthening SADC and other regional organisations in Africa is a major long-term priority for the German Government. The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB) and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) are heavily involved in pursuing this goal. 
Vaclav Havel once said that 
“the treatment of the Roma is the litmus test of democracy”. 
Our democracy and Europe still need to pass this test. 
Let us do something. 
Let us do the right thing. 
Moreover, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibits states parties from possessing or deploying chemical weapons of any kind. 
Since then, the fact-finding mission has established that chlorine gas has been systematically used as a weapon on several occasions and that mustard gas and sarin have also been deployed. 
OVCW-Inspector … OPCW inspector in Syria 
The armed opposition and the Syrian regime mostly accuse each other of deploying chemical weapons.

The United States and the EU have therefore voted to impose chemical-weapons-related sanctions on Syria on several occasions. 
Since 2013 there have been continual reports of chemical weapons being deployed in Syria. 
As information on their deployment in Syria is often contradictory, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) launched a fact-finding mission in May 2014 to investigate the plausibility of reports concerning the use of chemical weapons. 
In order to be able to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice, the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed to create the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) in August 2015. 
The Federal Government has also condemned these violations of international humanitarian law in the strongest possible terms. 
Sinti and Roma remain on the outskirts of our societies. 
Relations between Europe and its largest ethnic minority are still defined by marginalisation, incomprehension, unfamiliarity and ignorance.

Over 19,300 Sinti and Roma were murdered in Auschwitz. 
The Holocaust of the Sinti and Roma – called “Porajmos” in Romany, which translates as devouring – annihilated half a million people. 
Here in Berlin, the persecution of the Sinti and Roma began in a particularly abhorrent way in the summer of 1936. 
We recognise the genocide of the Sinti and Roma, which is one of the darkest chapters of our history. 
Despite this recognition, the Sinti and Roma in Germany and Europe remain a largely unknown chapter in our continent’s history. 
It is no coincidence that the Porajmos is known as the forgotten Holocaust. 
Something must also grow out of them. 
Our awareness that injustice was perpetrated but not acknowledged means we have a duty to the present and the future. 
Mr Höllenreiner, you are a good example of how one can live up to this duty, as are Romani Rose, Zoni Weisz and Otto Rosenberg. 
You live in Germany and fight for the rights of Sinti and Roma. 
Without you, we would not have this day of commemoration for the Porajmos. 
Germany was very reluctant to recognise the crimes by Nazi Germany against the Sinti and Roma as genocide. 
But instead of contact and interaction, all too often we still witness ignorance and stereotypes that are simply not called into question. 
As the majority society, we need to change our perception of and stance towards the Sinti and Roma. 
And let us do this right thing together. 
Germany has paid five million euros into the OPCW’s Trust Fund for Syria Missions for the destruction of chemical weapons and supports the OPCW in investigating suspected uses of chemical weapons in Syria (e.g. by providing security training courses for inspectors). 
Syria’s accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention Following the use of sarin against civilians on 21 August 2013 in the area surrounding the Syrian capital Damascus, the United States threatened Syria with military action. 
The United States and Russia subsequently agreed to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons programme, and the Syrian regime expressed its readiness to destroy its chemical weapons.

In his opening statement, Dr Stefan Oswald, Director for Sub-Saharan Africa at the BMZ, spoke about Germany’s Africa initiatives (G20 Africa Partnership, Marshall Plan with Africa), designed to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. 
So the German priorities are closely aligned with the SADC priorities/SADC Revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan – RISDP 2015-2020, which aim to improve infrastructure development, industrialisation and market integration in southern Africa. 
In the course of the negotiations, the participants reaffirmed the joint goal of cooperation, namely to strengthen regional cooperation for the benefit of the people and to reduce poverty. 
Furthermore, Germany is continuing its support for strengthening national/regional cooperation arrangements in the SADC region. 
The delegations were headed by SADC Executive Secretary Dr Stergomena Tax and Alois Schneider, Head of Division for Southern Africa at the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

because otherwise we would be guilty of causing further harm to the some 12 million Sinti and Roma in Europe. 
We have gathered here today to remember 2 August 1944. 
At 7 p.m. on this day 73 years ago, the part of Auschwitz-Birkenau that the Nazis called the “Gypsy Camp” was sealed off following an order from Berlin, 
In total, some 22,600 Roma and Sinti had been imprisoned under inhumane conditions in Auschwitz alone by 1944. 
Wilhelm Frick, who was Reich Minister of the Interior at the time, tasked the President of Police in Berlin with conducting what was called a “day‑long, city‑wide manhunt for gypsies” and interning those identified by the authorities. 
That is why I would like to take this opportunity to thank the foundation, its director Uwe Neumärker and his team for the dedication and hard work with which they keep memories alive. 
I am grateful to you for repeatedly raising this issue with us. 
Please do not stop making demands of us, be it in your pursuit of an independent commission of experts or the establishment of the role of a commissioner to combat anti‑Gypsyism. 
For this reason, I am particularly happy that we were able to celebrate the opening of the European Roma Institute for Arts and Culture here in Berlin in June. 
I hope it will help to remove prejudices and to raise awareness of the culture of the Sinti and Roma all over Europe. 
The aim was that Berlin would be “zigeunerfrei”, as the Nazis put it, by the start of the Summer Olympics – in other words that there would be no more Sinti and Roma in the city. 
Most of them died as a result of the cruel and intentional starvation rations or of diseases and epidemics; over 5,600 people were killed in the gas chambers, while others became the victims of individual violence or medical crimes. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the death of Martin Roth 
Bridge-builders in Europe: 
On Friday (4 August), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajčák signed a declaration of intent on deepening their bilateral cooperation. 
The Foreign Ministers’ talks focused on the future of the EU and strengthening the United Nations. 
Lajčák is assuming the Presidency of the UN General Assembly from September.

Federal Foreign Office on the decision by the UN Security Council to impose tighter sanctions on North Korea 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (6 August) on the decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose tighter sanctions on North Korea: 
With its irresponsible missile tests, North Korea is flouting international law and thereby jeopardising regional and international peace. 
We will always remember Martin Roth as someone who tirelessly advocated culture’s political responsibility. 
We shall miss him. 
We share in the grief of his widow and family.” 
A joint road map for this dialogue is to be adopted by the spring of next year. 
Bridge-builders in the EU 
Our goal of a denuclearised Korean peninsula remains. 
Zusammenarbeit vertiefen … Deepening cooperation: 
Gabriel and his Slovak counterpart Lajčák © Gottschalk/photothek.net 
Over the course of his successful career, Martin Roth set new benchmarks for museum work. 
Security through stability: 
strengthening the role of the UN 
Gabriel said that it was important to strengthen the role of the United Nations. 
In view of the current global security situation, the focus should not only be on rearmament, but, above all, on stabilisation and sustainable development. 
Slovakia could count on Germany’s support for its presidency, Gabriel stated. 
Slovakia 
We welcome the decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose fresh, tighter sanctions on North Korea. 
Germany and Slovakia intend to deepen their cooperation 
Germany has consistently spoken out in favour of stricter sanctions. 
These now need to be implemented seamlessly. 
Gabriel added that Germany and Slovakia were not only close partners in the bilateral context, 
In view of this, North Korea must be compelled to cease its illegal missile and nuclear testing and comply with the Security Council resolutions. 
but that Slovakia was also playing an important role in the context of the EU with respect to reforms in the Community. 
His commitment to fostering cultural collaboration, as well as understanding across linguistic, political and cultural divides, was second to none. 
Gabriel added that Slovakia had an important role as a partner and bridge-builder in this regard. 
It is good that the international community has agreed on a united and substantive response to the most recent tests, in which intercontinental ballistic missiles were launched. 
At his meeting with his counterpart Miroslav Lajčák, Foreign Minister Gabriel emphasised that Germany and Slovakia had already had ties in many areas. 
The aim is to develop these relations in the future. A comprehensive dialogue is to be established between the two countries encompassing the entire field of domestic and foreign policy, as well as business and education policy. 
“As important as the partnership between Germany and France is, 
Europe consists of 28, soon 27, countries on an equal footing,” said Gabriel. 
In the current debates on the future of the EU, he went on, we must remember that the EU would not survive if only two or three major countries worked together. 
Only if all countries continued to develop common values and concepts for business and society would it be possible to safeguard the future of the EU, he added. 
The main aim, he said, was to avoid a division of the Community into western and eastern European countries. 
Germany and Slovakia will soon be cooperating closely with each other in a further area. 
Miroslav Lajčák is assuming the Presidency of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly in mid-August. 
Martin Roth was one of the best and most influential museum directors in the world, an outspoken intellectual and an innovative advocate for culture. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (7 August) on the death of Professor Martin Roth: 
“I am profoundly saddened by Martin Roth’s premature death. 
But more than anything, in all areas of his work he focused on a topic that gave us a great sense of connection with one another, that is, on giving people, particularly young people and people from different backgrounds, access to culture and cultural education. 
I thus greatly valued his guidance as President of the ifa (Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen), but beyond this role also as my Special Representative for Cultural Relations and Education Policy and as a friend. 
As Director of the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum in Dresden, in his work for EXPO 2000 in Hanover and his ten years as Director General of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections), he took an innovative approach and pursued a clear vision of museums as venues for thought-provoking debate. 
He was Director of the V&A in London from 2011 to 2016, and the first non‑British person to hold this post. 
His pioneering exhibitions made the world’s largest museum for art and design a huge draw for visitors and raised its international profile. 
In 2016, Martin Roth was awarded the Officer’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his services to cultural cooperation between Germany and the United Kingdom. 
He believed that art should be political, get involved and take a stance. 
Time and again, he demonstrated the courage to engage in political debate, not only in the exhibition, The Art of the Enlightenment, in Beijing in 2011‑2012, which he co‑organised as Director of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) with the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and the Bavarian State Painting Collections, 
but also in his new role as President of the ifa (Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen), which he took up on 1 July 2017 and planned to use to promote an open society and intercultural exchange in terms of truly global cultural work. 
Today we have lost a cultural visionary and a true advocate for tolerance and open‑mindedness. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth attends inauguration of Iranian President Rouhani in Tehran 
Roth made the following statement to the German media: 
… Roth mit Zarif… Minister of State Michael Roth with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif © FFO 
Minister of State Roth emphasised that Germany supports strict implementation of the nuclear agreement and urges all sides to fully comply with their obligations. 
Exchange with civil society 
While in Iran, the Minister of State had an opportunity to visit Golestan Palace in Tehran, one of the country’s many important cultural monuments, as well as to meet with civil society representatives from the spheres of art, the media and business. 
On this occasion, Roth met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Deputy Foreign Minister for European and American Affairs Majid Takht-Ravanchi. 
The talks with Foreign Minister Zarif and Deputy Foreign Minister Takht-Ravanchi focused on implementation of the nuclear agreement, regional political issues and expanding bilateral relations. 
These discussions showed that the young generation in particular pins great hopes on the opening of the country, and that it believes it will benefit from closer relations with Germany in particular. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel to visit Uganda 
He went on to underscore that human rights must be respected, also referring to specific cases, and said that ethnic and religious minorities must be protected, such as Christians and the Baha’i. 
Uganda is doing its utmost to integrate refugees. 
Uganda urgently needs more support from the international community in order to be able to continue taking in people fleeing from South Sudan. 
The situation in Uganda shows that the international community must provide support at an early stage so that regional refugee movements do not become global migration crises. 
Neighbouring countries that help refugees must not be left to cope with the situation on their own. 
Journey to the hub 
During his visit to Uganda, Gabriel will go far beyond the usual talks with the political elite. 
Gabriel will meet aid workers and refugees in order to gain a first-hand impression of the situation. 
Human rights will also be on the agenda 
The agenda for their talks will include the human rights situation and freedom of the press. 
On Thursday, Gabriel and his delegation will travel on to South Sudan, the origin of the conflict.

Minister of State Michael Roth visited Tehran on 5 and 6 August, where he represented the German Government at the inauguration of Hassan Rouhani, who was recently re‑elected President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
“It is the desire of a large majority of people in Iran for President Rouhani to stay the course and carry out his electoral promises; they want his second term to lead to more openness, both at home and abroad.” 
Roth also said that Germany has a strong interest in intensifying bilateral cultural exchange.

In particular, development projects must support communities that take in large numbers of refugees so that people in need can continue to find refuge.

Another topic raised was the kidnapping of a Vietnamese government critic. 
Published in the “Badische Zeitung” on 9 August 2017 
Minister Gabriel, German nationals like the journalist Deniz Yücel or the human rights activist Peter Steudtner ending up in prison in Turkey are unfortunately no longer isolated cases. 
What about a Vietnamese government critic being abducted in the middle of Berlin and taken to Hanoi by the secret service? Is that really an isolated case? 
Do you see any sign that the Turkish President might move back to a more moderate, more democratic course in the near future or medium term? 
There are now nine Germans who have no idea what crimes they are being accused of or who are having to fight far‑fetched accusations. 
Turkey has long wanted to become part of this community.

“There need to be changes in Ankara if we are to make a fresh start.” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is calling for “changes in both tone and substance” from the Turkish Government in order for tense relations with the Federal Republic to improve. 
We were forced to see that our patience and our readiness to engage in a fair dialogue have not yielded any fruit. 
What impact does this have on EU accession talks?

Statement by the Human Rights Commissioner on an imminent execution in Iran 
Following reports of the imminent execution of the young Iranian Alireza Tajiki, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy Bärbel Kofler issued the following statement today (9 August): 
The news that the execution of young Iranian Alireza Tajiki could be imminent fills me with great concern. 
Should Alireza Tajiki be executed, this would be an unacceptable violation of international law. 
Alireza Tajiki must be given a fair trial under the rule of law – and without the imposition of the death penalty. 
The German Government opposes the death penalty, whatever the circumstances. 
Alireza Tajiki, who is now 20 years old, was arrested in May 2012 at the age of 15 with other young men on suspicion of murder and rape. 
In April 2013, he was sentenced to death by a court in Fars province. 
According to a recent Amnesty International report, his conviction was based on confessions extracted through torture which he subsequently withdrew on repeated occasions. 
The original verdict was quashed in April 2014 and the court ordered an examination of Tajiki’s mental maturity. 
In November 2014, however, Tajiki was again sentenced to death on the basis of a medical report which claimed he had attained “mental maturity”. 
As a result of international pressure, his execution, which was due to be carried out on 3 August 2016, was postponed. 
Campaigning against torture and the death penalty 
He was only 15 years old at the time of the crimes of which he stands accused, and there are considerable doubts as to whether his trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the rule of law.

The first part of his trip took Gabriel to Rhino Camp Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda, 
where around 50,000 refugees live. Gabriel met refugees and aid workers in the camp. 
Gabriel said it was now important to provide support to Uganda. 
Supporting mediation efforts 
The neighbouring countries should now be encouraged to mediate in the South Sudan conflict. 
The agenda for their talks included the human rights situation and freedom of the press. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to provide even more support to Uganda before it is too late. 
In the case of Uganda, the focus here is on the ongoing civil war in South Sudan that is forcing people to leave their native country. 
In this context, cooperation between the neighbouring countries in Africa is particularly important. 
There was already good cooperation in the area around Lake Victoria between Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, Gabriel said. 
Gabriel will visit the South Sudanese capital, Juba, on Thursday. 
It was also important to combat the causes of migration and displacement, Gabriel said.

Foreign Minister Gabriel is visiting one of the world’s most important hot spots for refugees, displaced persons and migrants in Africa – 
Up to 2000 people per day pour across the border to Uganda from South Sudan, fleeing brutal fighting and severe droughts. 
Uganda, a land‑locked country at Lake Victoria, is nevertheless keeping its borders open for refugees. 
There is a huge willingness to help – 
Uganda does not only take in a large number of refugees, but is also a role model as regards their integration. 
Refugees only spend a short period of time in refugee camps in Uganda. 
They can move freely around the country, are allowed to work and are even allocated a plot of land. 
drought destroyed a large part of the harvest in the spring. 
“It is impressive that a country like Uganda, which is itself poor, is opening its borders to help people fleeing from the civil war in South Sudan,” he said after his visit. 
Preventing a global migration crisis 
He thus wants to encourage a new approach. 
Germany has already provided over 60 million euros in aid to Uganda this year.

At the heart of the conflict – Foreign Minister Gabriel visits South Sudan 
Foreign Minister Gabriel wants to ensure that aid provided by the international community reaches these people. 
His schedule in the capital Juba will include talks with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and United Nations Special Representative David Shearer. 
However, it has collapsed since independence. 
Millions of people have been forced to flee their homes. 
The severe drought in the spring dramatically worsened the crisis in the country. 
Over a million people have fled to neighbouring Uganda. 
Aid must reach the starting point of the refugee crisis 
Gabriel has now travelled on to the starting point of the refugee crisis. 
More humanitarian aid from Germany 
Bild: Kind in einem Lager… Child in an IDP camp in South Sudan © photothek.net 
Germany is working on many levels to alleviate the plight of the people in South Sudan and to stabilise the country. 
Germany also wants the human rights violations committed during the conflict to be addressed by a court of justice yet to be established in the country. 
Millions of people in the country are in need. 
Bureaucracy in the government apparatus and corrupt security forces have repeatedly blocked aid supplies. 
In his talks with South Sudanese President Kiir, Gabriel wants to encourage the Government and armed opposition to return to the negotiating table. 
Sigmar Gabriel is travelling to South Sudan today (10 August). He is the first German foreign minister to visit the country since it became independent. 
South Sudan only became independent in 2011 and is the newest country in the world. 
Government troops and rebels are alleged to have committed the most egregious human rights violations. 
In his talks in the South Sudanese capital Juba, he wants to clear the path for larger supplies of humanitarian aid. 
The German Government has increased humanitarian aid for the country to 90 million euros this year. 
Germany is also providing up to 50 Bundeswehr soldiers to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which Gabriel will visit in Juba. 
The parties to the conflict must restart negotiations 
However, there will only be hope for the people in South Sudan once a ceasefire is finally upheld. 
To date, neither side has been particularly active in implementing the peace agreement negotiated in 2015. 
Civil war, chaos and famines have made South Sudan the starting point of the largest refugee crisis in Africa. 
We are standing here in a place

the debates about taking in refugees in Germany – 
and so it’s a bit shameful [to see] 
The fastest marathons have been run in Berlin on ten occasions. 
Brutal violence between opposing ethnic groups kept spiralling out of control, and a civil war has been raging since 2013. 
Hundreds of thousands are seeking refuge in remote parts of the country or United Nations refugee camps. 
The ongoing violence and poorly functioning state apparatus stand in the way of humanitarian aid reaching the population.

That is also the view of the vast majority of the up to one million spectators, 
Since its early days, the Berlin Marathon has become one of the most important marathon events in the world. 
Message on the occasion of the 44th BMW Berlin-Marathon 
A great sporting classic awaits us in September, when Berlin will host Germany’s largest marathon. 
Over 70,000 athletes from near and far will undertake a challenging course as runners, speed walkers, inline skaters, wheelchair competitors or hand cyclists. 
The circular course will not only take competitors past a large number of sights – it has also often been the scene of new world records. 
This year, a new Hall of Fame at the Brandenburg Gate will pay tribute to the athletes who have gone down as winners in the history of this classic race, 
starting with Uta Pippig and Steve Moneghetti, winners of the 1990 event just a few days before Germany was reunited, who raced to the finishing line through the formerly divided eastern and western parts of the city. 
However, everyone who completes the course of over 42 kilometres is a winner. 
who line the roads and create a wave of enthusiasm that supports professionals, amateurs and recreational athletes alike over the long course. 
The Berlin Marathon is a wonderful mixture of world-class performance and mass sport. 
This is also reflected in the fact that more and more competitors do their best to collect money for a good cause. 
As patron of the 44th BMW Berlin Marathon, I would like to sincereley thank all those who help make this huge sporting event a success. 
The organisers from SCC EVENTS, the many voluntary workers, the medical services, police, fire brigade, sponsors and media all work together with the athletes and spectators to make the Berlin Marathon a popular movement in the best sense of the term. 
I wish all those involved a successful and interesting weekend and hope the weather conditions will be good. 
His schedule in the capital Juba included talks with South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and United Nations Special Representative David Shearer.

Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the execution of Alireza Tajiki 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (11 August) on the execution of the young Iranian Alireza Tajiki: 
I am deeply shocked that Alireza Tajiki was put to death by Iran despite the international protests. 
He was only 15 years old at the time of the crime he is accused of having committed. 
Gabriel in South Sudan: the parties to the conflict must restart negotiations 
Gabriel travelled to South Sudan on Thursday (10 August). He is the first German foreign minister to visit the country since it became independent. 
During his talks in South Sudan, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for aid provided by the international community to reach these people. 
In his talks in the South Sudanese capital Juba, he called for the path to be cleared for larger supplies of humanitarian aid. 
“All of the parties to the conflict must finally start thinking about the good of the Government and not only their own interests,” Gabriel said after his talks with Kiir. 
A clear message to President Kiir: Gabriel in South Sudan 
... “It is often extremely dangerous here for the staff of international aid organisations,” Gabriel said. 
Tight security measures were in place for the trip through the war-torn country. 
Gabriel met President Salva Kiir in the capital. 
During his visit to Uganda the previous day (9 August), Foreign Minister Gabriel had gained a first-hand impression of the situation facing refugees in Uganda and promised the country help in taking in people from South Sudan. 
His execution violates international law and is completely unacceptable!

State Secretary Lindner on the signing of an air transport agreement with Mauritius 
Federal Foreign Office condemns attack against White Helmets in Syria 
A Federal Foreign Office spokesperson issued the following statement today (14 August) on the attack in the Syrian province of Idlib, in which several members of the White Helmets were killed: 
We condemn these callous murders in the strongest possible terms. 
Since the establishment of the organisation in 2013, the White Helmets have rescued more than 90,000 people from houses reduced to ruins, often following air strikes by the Syrian regime. 
Since 2013, almost 200 of its workers have been killed. 
The killing of the organisation’s staff was directed against this very symbolism. 
For many people in Syria the White Helmets have come to symbolise hope and civil courage, and all too often they have rescued people at the very last moment. 
Early on Saturday morning, seven members of the White Helmets were attacked and killed at their base in Sarmin in the Syrian province of Idlib. 
State Secretary of the Federal Foreign Office Walter J. Lindner issued the following statement today (14 August) in connection with the signing of an air transport agreement with Mauritius: 
This air transport agreement with Mauritius is part of the German Government’s efforts to increase cooperation with the countries bordering the Indian Ocean. 
On Monday, 14 August, State Secretary Walter Lindner met with Dr Kheswar Jankee, the Republic of Mauritius’ Ambassador in Berlin, for talks at the Federal Foreign Office. 
In addition to discussing regional political and economic issues, they signed an air transport agreement that replaces the previous one, which dates back to 1974. 
The new agreement gives both sides additional traffic rights and thereby promotes bilateral tourism and trade. 
I was 32 when the Cold War came to an end. 
At that time, we all thought 
not only the Cold War with Russia has returned, but there are genuine “hot wars” all around the world. 
Civil war, terror and confrontations between states are, unfortunately, an everyday phenomenon once again. 
US President Donald Trump’s answer is to rearm. 
What is more, 
If we cooperated better and stopped wasting billions, then everyone in Europe could save money instead of dramatically increasing military expenditure. 
CDU/CSU Defence Ministers have been tinkering with the Bundeswehr for the past 12 years. 
We must therefore give our servicemen and women better equipment and pay. 
This is also what the general election is about. 
The BWC lacks both a treaty organisation and a verification regime. 
Conventional arms control 
Peace and security are once again under threat in Europe. 
Military conflicts have come closer to us in the 21st century. 
Germany stands at the forefront of those who shoulder responsibility for the security of the alliance. 
A Bundeswehr battalion is serving in Lithuania on NATO’s eastern border. 
What we need are common efforts in the area of arms control. 
All Europeans stand to benefit from this, including the Russians. 
Furthermore, we must also strengthen our rules and order in the area of nuclear arms control. 
This conflict will only be resolved by negotiations. 
Anyone who genuinely intends to get closer to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons requires functioning treaties and agreements with reliable monitoring mechanisms. 
The nuclear-weapon states must reduce their arsenals, permanently refrain from nuclear tests and cease the production of weapons-grade materials. 
Our long-term objective must also be to withdraw remaining tactical nuclear weapons that are still stored in Europe. 
The situation today is not the same as in 1986. 
We must go to at least the same lengths in the area of effective disarmament. 
Germany must be a pioneer of disarmament and not an agent of rearmament. 
Regardless of the fact that NATO has never made such an apodictic decision, there is no reasonable argument to support this wrong approach. 
And Germany must remain a force for peace and not become a weapons factory. 
Russia’s annexation of Crimea in contravention of international law and the situation in eastern Ukraine are a major breach of trust. 
It was right that NATO responded to this. 
We shouldn’t stand idly by when the European security architecture is at risk of degenerating into a wasteland of decommissioned, cancelled and obsolete treaties. 
Pyongyang’s threat to use nuclear weapons is shaking the entire region, and the impacts of this are being felt as far away as here in Europe. 
It is precisely this treaty that is currently under threat. 
The Americans should resume the dialogue on strategic stability and do everything in their power to save the existing arms control architecture. 
This will only be possible, however, when we finally make considerable progress on disarmament as a whole. 
That is the mantra of people such as President Trump, and one that he also wants to impose on his NATO partners. 
Today, we have seen that 
he is increasing his military spending while slashing development aid and the social budget at the same time. 
Unfortunately, the reality is that this is precisely what is happening. 
At the end of the day, it is clear to me too that the Bundeswehr is in need of greater support. 
But that is not the same as ploughing ahead and doubling military expenditure. 
North Korea reminds us right now of just how urgent this is. 
Furthermore, we will continue to work to ensure that Moscow and Washington extend the New START Treaty, which is to expire in 2021 and which has reduced strategic weapons and delivery systems. 
Russia’s actions of aggression have put at risk much of what we believed we had achieved. 
namely wasting billions on weapons in order to placate Donald Trump. 
Arms do not create security 
Article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the “Rheinische Post” of 16 August 2017 
that the age of the arms race was over and that world peace had come. 
I had just become a member of the parliament of Land Lower Saxony. 
And, compared with the era of East-West confrontation, these conflicts and wars are far more complex and difficult to handle. 
The question is how we should respond to this. 
If someone had told me a year ago that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union of Germany/Christian Social Union) would also go down this calamitous route, then I would have thought this impossible and would have called this out as entirely excessive criticism. 
Merkel, the CDU/CSU and now also the FDP (Free Democratic Party) want to follow Trump’s lead and double Germany’s military expenditure. 
Trump and Merkel would have us spend more than 70 billion euros on the military each year! 
And because that’s a lot of money – France, as a nuclear power, “only” spends 40 billion euros each year – Jens Spahn, the CDU’s financial expert and political protégé of Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, says that this spending should be offset by cuts to the social welfare budget. 
Angela Merkel rejects this, but why should we believe her? 
Shortly before previous elections, the CDU Chancellor flatly rejected the abolition of conscription, shutting down nuclear power stations and the introduction of road tolls – only to do the exact opposite shortly after the elections. 
This submission to Trump’s rearmament policy is wrong and unnecessary. 
Europe spends roughly half the amount that the US commits to defence – but with only 15 percent of the efficiency. 
Germany would be well advised to double its efficiency instead of its spending. 
Former Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg even wanted to make cutbacks of five billion euros a year. His Bundeswehr reform was about as carefully thought through as his doctoral thesis. 
What is even more important is that each and every German soldier who has been deployed abroad tells us that neither security nor stability can be achieved with weapons and the military alone. 
Only sustainable development, the fight against hunger, poverty and corrupt governments, and better opportunities for people give rise to lasting peace. 
This is the great task that Europe faces – investing in peace instead of in war. 
It is about opposing submission to the militarisation of foreign policy advocated by Donald Trump. 
And not bowing down to this as, to my horror, the CDU/CSU and FDP now intend to do. 
However, when we only concern ourselves with the logic of deterrence, then we further escalation. 
This calls for a comprehensive fresh start for conventional arms control, i.e. for conventional weapons of war in Europe. 
We must also make sure that Russia plays its part here. 
We depend here on Russia and the USA, which, taken together, account for around 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. 
I remember how the world looked to Reykjavík on 11 October 1986. 
That was before my time in the parliament of Land Lower Saxony. 
I was still serving on the Goslar district council and working in municipal policy 
when Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met at Höfði House in Reykjavík and conducted world politics. 
The two men thrashed out a treaty that we benefit from to this day, the INF Treaty, which forbade the use of land-based intermediate-range missiles, thereby becoming a cornerstone of European security. 
Russia must address the allegations that it is knowingly violating this treaty – especially against the backdrop of Moscow’s expansion of its non-strategic nuclear arsenal in Europe. 
we still need dialogue, a clear position and clear offers. 
We must break free from the shackles of the vicious logic that claims that arms create security. 
Unfortunately, I fear that Angela Merkel intends to do just that after the elections, 
The SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) will not be cajoled into doing this. 
We cannot invest our energy, ideas and our money primarily in the development of new weapons systems. 
I would like to offer Horst Köhler my most sincere congratulations! 
He is just the right man for the challenges at hand. 
Since 2016, Prof. Horst Köhler has, together with Kofi Annan, headed up a Special Panel of the African Development Bank that advises the bank on the implementation of its strategies. 
Allow me to wish him every success for his new and important role. 
The panel’s report laid the foundations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the United Nations in 2015. 
Horst Köhler is the successor to Christopher Ross, who was the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara from 2009. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel congratulates Horst Köhler on his appointment as Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara 
Horst Köhler has long devoted himself to the African continent with dedication and passion – for many years as Federal President and latterly on behalf of the African Development Bank. 
Together with all those concerned, he will work on finding a just, viable political solution for the Western Sahara that is accepted by all sides. 
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Prof. Horst Köhler as his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara today (16 August). 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (16 August) on Horst Köhler’s appointment as Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara: 
In 2012, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made him a member of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. 
A new Cold War?

Old questions, new answers 
The current political debate is marked by calls for greater spending on arms and defence. 
“We are currently repeating the worst mistakes of the Cold War.

Disarmament – a topic on which there is consensus? 
FFO Artist in Residence Programme 
The Commission issues its declarations on the basis of consensus. 
A task for German policymakers 
In the experts’ view, Germany should use its influence with the US and Russia, as disarmament is in everyone’s interest. 
The trend to militarising foreign policy must be stopped. 
Federal Foreign Office disarmament projects 
Foreign Minister Gabriel meets the Deep Cuts Commission 
There is a risk of a new Cold War. 
The focus was on relations between the US and Russia and the implications of this for European security. 
In his talks with experts from Russia, the US and Germany, Foreign Minister Gabriel’s aim was to explore how new steps can be taken to uphold and refine arms control architecture despite the currently difficult situation. 
After the meeting, Foreign Minister Gabriel expressed concern: 
Europe will be the victim in this scenario.” 
The Deep Cuts Commission is a trilateral German-Russian-US commission of experts that addresses prospects for the US and Russia reducing their nuclear arsenals, a step that is crucial to nuclear disarmament. 
“We regard these developments as a reason for the Federal Foreign Office to focus on this area.” 
On Wednesday (16 August), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and the members of the Deep Cuts Commission discussed how global regulations on arms control can be upheld and expanded. 
The current tense situation on the Korean Peninsula shows all too clearly how much we need disarmament, arms control and discussion on a world without nuclear weapons. 
This was one reason why Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel discussed with the Russian, American and German members of the Deep Cuts Commission on Wednesday (16 August) how global regulations on arms control can be upheld and expanded. 
The most important treaties and agreements on arms control are being destroyed. 
In total, the Commission has 21 members comprised of an equal number of high-level experts from the research and consulting sectors, as well as former government officials and diplomats, from the three countries. 
These statements highlight obstacles on the path of further US-Russian disarmament in the nuclear and conventional sectors and make concrete recommendations on nuclear and conventional disarmament. 
The Commission bases its views on the assumption that disarmament is only possible if it takes into account strategic balance and that current nuclear arsenals are excessively large because they still follow the logic of the Cold War. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel believes that German policymakers must play a role here.

Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the attack in Barcelona 
“I am deeply shocked by the news from Barcelona. 
Our sympathy goes out to the victims and their friends and families. 
We stand resolutely shoulder to shoulder with our Spanish friends at this difficult time. 
We stand together. We will not bow down to terrorism and it will not divide us.” 
As a member of the Senate, Mr Ould Ghadda was protected by parliamentary immunity. 
His arrest contravenes the principles of the rule of law. 
Mauritania country profile 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (18 August) on the arrest of a Mauritanian senator and the situation in the country following the constitutional referendum: 
“The unknown whereabouts of Senator Mohamed Ahmed Ould Ghadda, who was detained in Mauritania on 11 August without an arrest warrant, fills me with great concern. 
Both his family and his solicitor have so far been denied contact with him. 
In the current situation in particular, all Mauritanians should work together to uphold peace and cohesion in society. 
These assemblies were broken up by the security forces, who used tear gas and batons. 
On the same day, President Abdel Aziz announced a law to implement the referendum result. 
Among other things, this law abolishes the Senate, to which Mr Ould Ghadda had belonged, with immediate effect. 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the arrest of a Mauritanian senator and the situation following the constitutional referendum 
I am also concerned by the restrictions on freedom of assembly and opinion, as well as the general deterioration in the human rights situation in Mauritania, particularly in connection with the constitutional referendum on 5 August 2017. 
I call on all political actors to seek dialogue and to resolve the current tensions peacefully and in accordance with internationally recognised regulations based on the rule of law. 
A constitutional referendum was held in Mauritania on 5 August 2017. 
Despite a blanket ban on assemblies, demonstrations by those who supported a boycott took place both before and after the vote. 
On 15 August 2017, the Constitutional Council confirmed the result of the referendum after checking complaints, particularly as regards possible election fraud. 
The main reason for the interest in the German system is its combination of theory (vocational colleges) and practice (companies). 
In order to implement its strategy, the German Government set up the German Office for International Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training (GOVET) (http://www.govet.international). 
Minister of State Böhmer welcomes ICC ruling on the protection of cultural property 
the population is to receive 2.7 million euros in compensation for the destruction of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
In this connection, Minister of State Maria Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, issued the following statement today (18 August): 
People in Timbuktu and in the whole of Mali are to receive compensation. 
These decisions played a major role in bringing about the ICC proceedings. 
It was a moving moment: 
A large part of the young population thus loses its voice and the opportunity of being represented politically. 
Cultural monuments and cultural heritage sites give people roots as well as an identity. 
The perpetrators inflict economic and, above all, serious psychological harm on a community. 
Protection of the world’s cultural heritage remains a considerable challenge for us in conflict-ridden times such as these, and all sections of the international community must therefore pull in the same direction. 
I called for this back in 2015 when I was President of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. 
During my term of office, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee strongly condemned the destruction of world cultural heritage as a potential war crime in the Bonn Declaration. 
In response to our joint initiative with Iraq, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2015 stating that the destruction of world cultural heritage could not be justified by any religion and should be regarded as a war crime. 
without the dedication of masons in Mali, the reconstruction of the mausoleums destroyed by radical Islamists would not have been possible and this world cultural heritage would have been lost forever. 
This was decided in The Hague yesterday by a division of the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
Al-Mahdi had been convicted and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment back in 2016 for his involvement in the destruction of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
At the session of the World Heritage Committee in Bonn in 2015, Minister of State Böhmer presented awards to representatives of the Timbuktu guild of masons, who had restored mausoleums of traditional mud construction badly damaged in 2012. 
The current sentence means that all three now hold a criminal record and lose their passive voting right for five years. 
The sentence sends a negative message against freedom of opinion, and we see a danger that it will deter others from political activities in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
They had been sentenced to community service or a suspended prison sentence by a trial court in August 2016. 
No matter where we come from. 
Watershed in the protection of cultural property: 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has brought about a watershed and sent a strong message in favour of the protection of cultural heritage. 
Their destruction is therefore also an attack on the dignity and faith of society, 
extinguishing a part of humanity’s shared cultural consciousness forever. 
At the session of the World Heritage Committee in Bonn in 2015, I presented the special prize of the UNESCO Director-General to the masons of Timbuktu for their work in restoring destroyed buildings. 
The Malian Islamist al-Mahdi is liable for damages amounting to 2.7 million euros in connection with the destruction of UNESCO World Heritage Site buildings in Timbuktu. 
Germany is supporting the preservation of cultural heritage around the world and works for greater protection in international fora. 
This is an unprecedented act of interference in our country’s sovereignty. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the Turkish President’s comments regarding the German elections 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 August) on the comments by Turkey’s President Erdogan concerning the German Bundestag elections: 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (18 August) on the sentencing of three pro‑democracy activists and leading figures in the peaceful Occupy Central protests in 2014 to several months in prison: 
We were very concerned to learn of yesterday’s sentence against three pro‑democracy activists in Hong Kong. 
As a result of this and other sentences during the past weeks, a large number of pro‑democracy activists now have a criminal record and lose their passive voting right for the next five years. 
We are particularly concerned about the decidedly political wording of the judgement, which creates doubts about the independence of the judiciary. 
We will follow further developments very closely and hope that further avenues of appeal will prove the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong. 
On 17 August, three internationally renowned student leaders and co‑initiators of the peaceful Occupy Central mass demonstrations of 2014 – Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow – were sentenced to between six and eight months in prison by the Court of Appeal. 
This new conviction after they have served their first sentence may violate Article 14(7) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also applies in Hong Kong and by which no one can be tried or punished again for the same offence. 
This blatant interference in the German election campaign shows that Erdogan wants to incite people in Germany against each other. 
Regardless of our origins, regardless of our passport: 
The Federal Foreign Office provided support for a clandestine rescue that saved 285,000 precious manuscripts from the World Heritage Site in Timbuktu from destruction and transported them to Bamako. 
Let us show those who want to play us off against each other that we refuse to go along with this scurrilous game! 
freedom, the rule of law and democracy. 
We will all stand shoulder to shoulder to defend that. 
I call on everyone in Germany to take a resolute stand against this attempt to stir people in this country up against each other. 
In particular, I would ask those who have their roots in Turkey but have a German passport to take part in the Bundestag elections and to cast their vote for a democratic party. 
we are all citizens of a free and democratic country. 
In Germany, everyone – no matter where their roots lie – can find what Erdogan is trying to destroy in Turkey: 
There is increasing interest worldwide in Germany’s dual system of vocational training. 
This system requires close cooperation between the state, business and social partners, which must fit into the structure of the society in question. 
For decades, the German Government has been active in many different ways in international cooperation in the field of vocational training. 
Strategy on international cooperation in vocational education and training 
To this end, the German missions in key locations abroad organise round tables for coordination and exchanges of experience. 
As an interministerial institution of the federal ministries, GOVET, which is based at the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB), organises round tables in Germany to coordinate activities by the ministries and many other stakeholders. 
The Federal President will hold talks with President Kersti Kaljulaid and Prime Minister Jüri Ratas in the Estonian capital Tallinn on 22 August. 
The following day, he and Ms Büdenbender will meet young Estonian leaders, with whom they will discuss the future of Europe and their expectations of the European Union.

Vocational education and training 
* The importance of vocational education and training 
Vocational training is an important factor in economic growth and technological progress. Moreover, it offers young people better career prospects and enables them to play a part in society. 
A field involving many stakeholders 
Various federal ministries, as well as the Länder, business associations, German chambers of commerce abroad, companies and other private providers (via the initiative iMOVE: Training – Made in Germany; http://www.imove-germany.de) have launched programmes and are implementing them in the various partner countries. 
Since 2013, cooperation has been based on the Federal Government strategy for one‑stop international cooperation in vocational education and training. 
As one of the four core ministries – alongside the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy – the Federal Foreign Office is responsible for coordinating the various activities undertaken in other countries.

Players and partners in the promotion of foreign trade and investment 
Three pillars for the promotion of foreign trade and investment 
Promoting foreign trade and investment is one of the Foreign Service’s main tasks. 
Promoting German economic interests is a priority task for the missions abroad. 
They are voluntary associations of companies from Germany and from the respective host country. 
They lobby in the interests of businesses from both Germany and the partner country and promote commercial activity in both directions. 
and that people from Afghanistan do not have to flee to Europe. 
Further migration does not only destabilise Afghanistan – it also destabilises Europe.” 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (22 August): 
The Germany Trade & Invest website offers newsletters for different areas of interest and business sectors. The German business portal iXPOS contains an overview of all points of contact in the more than 70 organisations that assist German companies in doing business abroad. 
“It is now important that the Americans speak with us Europeans about how we can work together to ensure that the country becomes more peaceful and more secure 
We expect Washington to coordinate the United States’ activities closely with us Europeans. 
The United States is focusing to an even greater extent on the threat posed by terrorist risks both in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan. 
We share the view that the Afghan Government must intensify its reform efforts further, also as a basis for continued financial support. 
“It is good that the United States continues to be strongly engaged in Afghanistan. 
Despite intensive endeavours by the international community, the prerequisites for Afghanistan coping without international support are not yet in place. 
We will work towards a political process, without which lasting peace will not be possible in the region. 
At the same time, civilian reconstruction efforts must continue undiminished. 
Our joint aim remains to support Afghanistan on its path to stable and self-determined statehood.” 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in Afghanistan 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (22 August) following yesterday’s presentation by the United States of its strategy for Afghanistan: 
Foreign trade is a key factor in Germany’s economic output and safeguards many jobs in Germany. 
Germany is integrated into the global economy and dependent on its growth to a greater extent than many other countries. 
In this connection, Germany’s competitiveness on the global market is of increasing importance. 
The shared responsibility of the international community to ensure stable economic development for the benefit of everyone is becoming increasingly apparent. 
Not even political conflicts can disguise the fact that trade and a dense network of economic links create trust and help stabilise international relations. 
In the free market economy, business initiative takes centre stage. 
The state and business work in close cooperation here. 
In addition to this, the state does much to promote business activities abroad (among other things, through trade fair programmes, investment protection agreements and guarantees for export credits and direct investments). 
The German Government is particularly keen to support small and medium-sized companies because they form the backbone of the German economy. 
Missions and chambers of commerce abroad therefore do all they can to advise and look after the interests of this group. 
Finally, they advise firms on business policy issues, inform business associations about interesting projects and tenders worldwide, report regularly on economic and political conditions abroad, and help assess the risks regarding export and investment guarantees. 
In addition to this diverse engagement, the missions carry out PR work for Germany as a location for business and work to improve conditions for German business activity around the world. 
Its attractiveness to foreign investors is crucial, for their investments create additional jobs in our country. 
At the same time, globalisation has meant that people’s lives all over the world are ever more closely interconnected. 
It is therefore a central task of Germany’s foreign policy both to promote and protect German economic interests in the world and to help foster the further development of just and sustainable global economic cooperation. 
The staff at German embassies and consulates general, as well as at headquarters in Berlin, see themselves as: 
Political mentors and facilitators 
Networkers 
Germany’s efforts to promote foreign trade and investment rely on support from both the public and the private sector and can be grouped into three institutional pillars: 
Germany’s missions abroad assist and advise companies around the world. 
The Federation and the Länder, as well as associations and societies, promote business and trade 
the Länder (federal states), 
including in the economic sphere. 
German Chambers of Commerce Abroad, Delegations and Representations of German Industry and Commerce 
German Chambers of Commerce Abroad are the official missions of German industry abroad. 
They thus assist German companies both in Germany and abroad with seeking concrete business opportunities and carrying out business. 
All three institutions are present in the world’s key markets. 
Many embassies also have staff from other Federal Ministries who can bring their knowledge to bear in fields such as the economy, agriculture, science, development cooperation, finance, and social affairs. 
Companies can approach the missions directly with their request for assistance, or they may contact the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin. 
The German Chambers of Commerce Abroad maintain 130 offices in 90 countries. 
Germany Trade & Invest provides a wide range of business information, with the aim of facilitating German companies’ access to international markets. 
German Chambers of Commerce Abroad, Delegations and Representations of German Industry and Commerce, and 
the country-specific associations (associations of businesses and institutions: German-African Business Association, Ibero-America Association, German Near and Middle East Association, Eastern and Central Europe Association, German Asia-Pacific Business Association, Australia and New Zealand Association), and 
Each mission always has at least one point of contact for economic affairs. 
Worldwide, German Chambers of Commerce Abroad have a membership of some 50,000 companies. Approximately 80% of these members are outside of Germany. 
If there is adequate demand, the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad will bundle services for clients in several countries or regions. 
Investment guarantees from the Federation 
* Involvement of the Federation in trade fairs abroad 
Guarantees for untied loans 
Germany is one of the world’s biggest industrialised countries. 
Owing to its limited domestic raw materials, companies depend on a stable supply of such resources from abroad. 
Further information is available on the following webpages: 
The Federation’s involvement in trade fairs abroad is designed in particular to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they seek to tap export markets. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the arrest of Kirill Serebrennikov 
The accusation of embezzlement is severe. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy, issued the following statement today (23 August) on the arrest in Saint Petersburg of the director Kirill Serebrennikov: 
More than 20% of the world’s population lives in South Asia. 
South Asia: 
Regional cooperation 
The skyline of Mumbai, India 
We now expect details of the charges to be presented and – if they are pressed – that he be given an objective, fair, speedy and transparent trial that sheds light on numerous yet unanswered questions. 
The chief aim is close economic cooperation. 
Germany has close partnerships with the countries of South Asia. 
Germany is an important development partner for South Asian countries and funds a wide range of projects. These include the development of renewable energies as well as promoting urban development, vocational training and democratic progress. 
In Afghanistan Germany’s efforts are focused on civilian reconstruction. 
Germany is also one of the largest troop contributors to the Resolute Support Mission, the NATO-led effort to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. 
I have noted with concern that the director Kirill Serebrennikov was arrested yesterday in Saint Petersburg, and I am following developments in this connection very closely. 
Serebrennikov is an internationally acclaimed artist who resides part‑time in Berlin and works with various German theatre companies. 
Numerous members of the cultural scene in Russia and in Germany have expressed their solidarity with him in the past. 
The International Contact Group on Afghanistan, which is co-chaired by Germany and Afghanistan, coordinates international efforts in the the country. 
A bicycle covered with rugs stands in a market 
Germany is an important economic partner for Bangladesh. In particular, Germany is the country’s largest export market, especially for textiles. 
Bangladesh is a development cooperation partner of Germany, with the main projects being in the areas of renewables, promoting good governance and adaptation to climate change. 
Although the Kingdom of Bhutan has friendly relations with Germany, diplomatic ties have not been established between the two countries. 
India is by far Germany’s largest partner in South Asia. 
Germany and India have a strategic partnership, and they conduct intergovernmental consultations every two years. 
The EU, too, maintains close ties with India and aims to conclude a free trade and investment agreement with the South Asian country. 
Many Germans know the Maldives as a tourist destination. 
More than 100,000 Germans visit the chain of islands every year. 
The Maldives opened an embassy in Berlin in 2016. Germany and the Maldives share interests primarily in the area of climate policy. 
Germany also supports humanitarian aid projects. 
Mutual visits are conducted by members of government and parliament, by means of which close contact is maintained with decision-makers in the region. 
Nevertheless, private German associations provide active support in the education and health care sector, and help to preserve Bhutan’s cultural heritage. This assistance is supported in part by the German Embassy in New Delhi and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
In Pakistan, Germany has a strong interest in the country’s democratic and stable development. 
The German Government rejects the death penalty under all circumstances and campaigns with its partners in the EU for its worldwide abolition. 
Tense relations between India and Pakistan and demographic and economic disparities are hampering progress on joint SAARC projects (www.saarc-sec.org), for example expanding transport networks and energy links, as well as promoting trade and investment. 
Instruments to promote business and investment 
The priorities here are building the country’s police force, administrative structures and judicial system, as well as developing education, the economy and employment opportunities. 
An important policy focus here is raising minimum social and environmental standards. 
Promoting exports with export credit guarantees (Hermes) 
Export credit guarantees are a most successful and important instrument of foreign trade and investment promotion. 
The last round of comprehensive consultations, which cover the entire range of Indo-German relations, was held in Berlin on 30 May 2017. The consultations were co-chaired by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a number of cabinet members on both sides participated. 
The Federal Government is closely following critical domestic political developments in the country. 
Germany supports Nepal’s efforts to recover from many years of civil war and to fight and overcome poverty in the country. 
Germany is assisting reconstruction efforts following the severe 2015 earthquake, as well as supporting the process of drawing up a national constitution. 
They are an indispensable tool for guaranteeing export credits, especially for deliveries and services to difficult and risky markets in emerging economies and developing countries, as well as for major projects. 
More information is available on the website of the Federation’s partner (Euler Hermes): 
Link to the annual report: 
Treaties promoting and safeguarding investments guarantee investors permanent and reliable legal protection that is binding under international law, thereby facilitating stable and predictable framework conditions in the long term. 
They are, generally speaking, the basis for granting investment guarantees. 
the Federal Government can, under certain conditions, support them with federal guarantees for untied loans for the purchase of raw materials. 
I am very concerned about the recently repeated announcements by senior members of the Government of the Republic of Maldives of plans to carry out the death penalty again. 
These guarantees safeguard creditors against economic and political credit defaults abroad. 
Projects must, as a rule, be eligible for support in political terms and be in Germany’s state and macroeconomic interests. 
I therefore urgently call on the Government and judiciary of the Republic of Maldives not to impose the death penalty or carry out the announced executions. 
In recent weeks, members of the Government of the Republic of Maldives have repeatedly announced plans to carry out the death penalty again in the South Asian island state for the first time in over 60 years. 
At the beginning of August 2017, both President Yameen and his Minister of the Interior announced that the first executions could be carried out in September 2017; on 22 August, this announcement was repeated by an advisor to Yameen. 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the announcement of executions in Maldives 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (23 August) on the announcement of executions in Maldives: 
The situation is part of a general development that is weakening democracy in Maldives and goes against human rights commitments. 
In direct talks with officials of the Government of the Republic of Maldives, I repeatedly pointed out that the death penalty is an inhumane and cruel form of punishment and harms the right to life. 
The growing importance of foreign trade and investment policy 
The role of the state in foreign trade and investment promotion 
This development has been supported and fostered by a responsible foreign trade and investment policy. 
State foreign trade and investment promotion therefore cannot, and indeed does not intend to, replace industry’s own efforts. 
Rather, it has a complementary effect, helping companies to access markets abroad and to assert themselves in these markets, and helps to enhance basic conditions for doing business. 
Where high barriers make access to foreign markets difficult for German companies, foreign trade and investment policy can help dismantle them. 
The Federal Foreign Office: political mentor, networker and adviser 
Foreign trade and investment promotion is one of the foreign service’s main tasks. 
Along with its just under 230 missions abroad, the Federal Foreign Office offers a broad range of services worldwide to support German firms engaged in foreign markets. 
Using their profound knowledge of the political scene and economy of the host country, they represent specific business interests vis‑à‑vis foreign government bodies, initiate and guide talks of relevance to business, establish contacts with political and business decision-makers and work towards market access for German products and services. 
What is more, they establish contacts between institutions, individuals and companies in Germany and the host country, support and hold roundtables, workshops and regional conferences and organise events for German firms exhibiting at trade fairs abroad and for these firms’ business partners. 
The Federal Foreign Office is involved, among other things, in the negotiation of double taxation agreements and works in European and international bodies such as the WTO, the OECD and the UN, to create conditions favourable to trade and investment and to achieve equal opportunities for German companies. 
Such agreements have been broken all too often in the past. 
The sides to the conflict should give OSCE observers safe access to the entire region, so that the ceasefire can be transparently monitored. 
The priority now is to finally take additional steps, so that progress can be made on implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
Hermes guarantees protect exporters and banks against defaults caused for political and economic reasons. 
Trade fairs abroad offer a good opportunity for sales and presentation of goods. They are also ideal forums for orientation, exchanging information and establishing contacts. 
The Federal Foreign Office on the situation in eastern Ukraine 
We welcome the fact that the Trilateral Contact Group has agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine ahead of the start of the school year. 
Following yesterday’s phone call in Normandy format, the ceasefire is also being expressly supported by the leadership of Russia and Ukraine. 
Although the region is seeing breathtaking development, it remains plagued by poverty and drawn-out conflicts. 
The region is of great importance to Germany, as trade with some South Asian countries is booming. 
So far, however, countries in this region conduct only five percent of their trade with other South Asian countries. 
Meanwhile, two German women are training to be astronauts in Russia. 
The fact that pupils will be returning to school should remind all sides to the conflict to respect the ceasefire and finally let the guns fall silent. 
An official moratorium had been in place in the country since 1953. In 2014, this moratorium was lifted by President Abdulla Yameen’s Government, which has been criticised internationally for its human rights violations. 
Bilateral cooperation focuses on good governance, preventing extremism, and on sustainable economic development. 
The German Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GPCCI) was established in the commercial hub of Karachi in May 2016. It is a member of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
European-Chinese survival training 
Matthias Maurer from Germany and Samantha Cristoforetti from Italy are currently undergoing survival training together with 16 astronauts from the China National Space Administration in what is a unique form of cooperation. 
The two Europeans are staying in the region for a total of ten days and are the first non-Chinese astronauts to undergo this training.

and even more because there is considerable doubt about the fairness and regularity of the trials against some of those convicted. 
Carrying out executions again after over 60 years would be a great setback for Maldives, 
Joint flights into space in the future 
It accounts for approx. three quarters of the population and economic output of the entire region. 
Germany’s economic creativity, high standards efficiency, and reliability have put it into the first division of leading industrialised nations.

Both state institutions (such as embassies, consulates general, Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI)) and business institutions (above all the German chambers of commerce abroad) provide information and advisory services and can broker contacts. 
Moreover, it is the state’s task in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, in the European Union, in the OECD and in the WTO, to work towards a framework through which competition and trade can develop as freely as possible while, at the same time, international employees’ rights and environmental standards are respected. 
Since 2015, political relations, too, have seen rapid development. There have been a number of meetings between the countries’ heads of government, foreign and economic ministers, and members of parliament. 
An Italian female astronaut and a German male astronaut are currently completing survival training in Yantai, China. 
Cristoforetti and Maurer are completing training in Yantai together with 16 Chinese astronauts 
As guests of the astronaut sea survival training base in Yantai, China, they are learning on the high seas about how to exit a space capsule in the event of landing on water. 
Samantha Cristoforetti has already spent six months at the ISS space station. 
This joint training is an example of the good cooperation between China and Europe in this area. 
More than 400 women applied for the coveted training positions. Meteorologist Insa Thiele-Eich and fighter pilot Nicola Baumann made the cut. 
From the Space Race to joint training programmes for astronauts – once a field dominated by international competition, cooperation in space travel is now flourishing. 
Matthias Maurer has yet to go on his first mission. Alongside training in China, he will be prepared for his flight into space at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne.

Two German women are currently training to be astronauts in a suburb of Moscow. 
Germany’s missions abroad (embassies and consulates general), 
In addition to the specific sections at the Federal Ministries, the most important players are: 
the German Centres for Industry and Trade in, e.g., New Delhi, Mexico City, Moscow, Beijing, Shanghai, and Singapore. 
The most important function of Germany’s nearly 230 missions abroad is to represent German interests in the host country – 
The missions abroad advise German companies and if necessary help them establish contacts; they support companies in dealing with government agencies to which they have particularly good access given their function; and they in general work to improve market access. 
German Chambers of Commerce Abroad are recognised by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry and are supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. 
One of their most important tasks is promoting foreign trade and investment for the benefit of members and non‑members. 
With the service “DEinternational“, the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad offer (for a fee) a wide range of standardised basic services, as well as country-specific specialised services. 
Its activities include promoting foreign trade, market observation, attracting investors and marketing and communication. GTAI also promotes the New Federal Länder and facilities cooperation with the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad. 
It offers information on requests for tender, assessments of business sectors, country reports and market analyses, as well as import regulations and business tips. 
Germany Trade & Invest provides export-oriented enterprises in Germany with the information they need on different markets and sectors, projects/calls for tender, laws, and customs regulations – in printed form, through online databases and by answering individual questions. 
With a view to attracting investment, GTAI helps to acquire, and also advises, foreign investors. 
It helps potential investors find a suitable location in Germany and and/or select a specific site, and establishes contact with the Länder agencies which promote business and trade. 
Germany Trade & Invest is a Federal Government agency and 
falls within the remit of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. 
The Federal Foreign Office and Germany’s missions abroad 
In some countries that are still developing a market economy, or in which German Chambers of Commerce Abroad have not yet been fully established, delegations and representations of German business under the authority of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry are charged with promoting foreign trade and investment. 
Germany supports Sri Lanka as the country works to reconcile its ethnic groups following a long civil war. Germany also provides advice on constitution-related issues and promotes vocational training for young Sri Lankans of all ethnic groups. 
South Asia: a region in flux 
a region in flux 
More than 20% of the world’s population lives in South Asia. The population of India alone numbers more than 1.25 billion. 
The region is of great importance to Germany. More than 1800 German companies already operate in India, and trade with some South Asian countries is booming. 
In 1985, the countries of South Asia decided to establish the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Afghanistan joined the group in 2007. 
In addition to the SAARC, efforts to advance regional integration include the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), which links a number of countries in South and South East Asia around the Bay of Bengal – although it does not include Pakistan. 
Both sides benefit from the exchange and have an opportunity to learn more about each other’s training methods and progress in space travel. 
If the project goes according to plan, one of them will be the first female German astronaut in space in 2020. 
From the Space Race to joint training programmes: European astronauts in China and Russia 
As sign of good European-Chinese cooperation: 
Even joint flights into space will be conceivable in the future, possibly to one of China’s space stations. 
First German female astronaut to receive training in Russia 
There is good cooperation not only with China, but also with Russia in the field of space travel. 
The Federal Government offers a facility to exporters and credit institutes that safeguards them against the risks of export business related to the foreign country (buyer’s risks and political risks in the country). 
The Federal Government has supported German direct investments in developing countries and emerging economies for over fifty years by safeguarding them against political risks with investment guarantees and by offering companies long‑term protection against incalculable risks (e.g. expropriations) when investing abroad. 
While individual companies are responsible for procuring the raw materials they need, 
Moreover, a requirement for receiving support in the form of a guarantee from the Federal Republic of Germany is the conclusion of a long‑term raw materials agreement with a German buyer. 
Two‑fifths of German industrial companies regularly exhibit abroad. 
Contracts sealed at trade fairs abroad and follow‑up business resulting from trade fairs account for roughly a quarter of export turnover for the companies involved. 
According to the Association of the German Trade Fair Industry (AUMA), over 6500 exhibitors at around 230 trade fairs abroad are supported each year. The lion’s share of these are small and medium-sized enterprises. 
More information is available on the website of the Federal Government’s partner (pwc) on investment guarantees: 
The trade fairs that the Federation takes part in are selected in close cooperation with business associations, German missions abroad, German Chambers of Commerce Abroad and AUMA. 
At this difficult time, we stand side by side with Finland. 
Please also convey our sincere sympathy to the families of the victims. 
As Europeans, we will never give in to terrorism. 
We must continue to stand up for our free and democratic values and convictions, which underpin Europe and the close friendship between Germany and Finland. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Independence Day of Ukraine 
On 24 August 1991, Ukraine’s members of parliament voted by a large majority for a free, independent and sovereign state of Ukraine. 
Germany has always closely cooperated with and supported Ukraine. 
We very much welcome that Ukraine has professed its commitment to our shared European values of democracy, the rule of law and freedom. 
As of June, Ukrainian citizens are permitted to travel to the EU without a visa. 
our common dream of widespread peace after the end of the Cold War did not become a reality. 
This is particularly true for people in Ukraine. 
We stand firmly by your side. 
The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine are non-negotiable. 
We will not recognise Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. 
Only yesterday, the sides to the conflict in eastern Ukraine agreed on a ceasefire for the start of the new school year. 
We greatly welcome this. 
26 years ago today, Ukraine declared its independence. 
Since then, much has been achieved in terms of reform, although more steps need to be taken. 
This is a cause for joy. 
Slava Ukraini! 
We followed the Revolution of Dignity on the Maidan with great empathy. 
I warmly congratulate all Ukrainian women and men on their Independence Day. 
All Ukrainians deserve to live a self-determined life – in peace, security and freedom. 
This year, we’ve already celebrated the 25th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. 
It is my hope for the people there that this agreement will be more than mere lip service, considering so many similar ones have not held long in the past. 
People in eastern Ukraine finally need to see genuine progress on implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (24 August) on the Independence Day of Ukraine: 
I was shocked and deeply saddened by the news of the terrible attack in Turku. 
Allow me to express my profound condolences to you and all Finns, also on behalf of my fellow Germans. 
We wish those injured in the attack great strength and a swift recovery. 
“Climate change often causes water and food shortages, leads to conflicts over land and resources and consequently gives rise to refugee and migration crises. 
On 4 September, State Secretary Walter J. Lindner and UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa signed the Agreement between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement regarding the UN Climate Change Conference – November 2017 in Bonn. 
headquarters of the UNFCCC Secretariat. 
On 11 August, the German Government held discussions on this issue with UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi and Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) William Swing. 
State Secretary Walter J. Lindner commented as follows on the signing of the agreement on COP 23 today (4 September 2017): 
The German Government is campaigning for humane treatment of refugees and migrants who have left their home countries and are on the move along migration routes. 
The UNHCR and the IOM are key partners of the German Government in this regard. 
The fight against human trafficking 
The German Government is campaigning for humane treatment of refugees and migrants all along the routes they are taking. 
Improving the humanitarian situation and creating opportunities in the countries of origin 
Those who have fled violence and persecution in their home country must be given the protection they need. 
At the same time, those who have gone to Libya in search of a better life need greater opportunities in their countries of origin. 
The UNHCR and the IOM are key partners in this endeavour 
The situation in Libya and along the Central Mediterranean route is a focus of Germany’s refugee and migration policy. 
Among other things, these talks focused on both the continuing flow of refugees and migrants across the Central Mediterranean and the humanitarian situation in Libya. 
A refugee camp in Misrata 
It is crucial that the international community work to improve the situation of people in Libya who are in need of assistance, especially the situation of migrants and refugees. 
Since late 2016, an IOM project has made available basic services to, and helped to integrate, internally displaced persons, migrants and refugees in southern Libya, which is a key migration route. 
Efforts of the German Government are part of engagement by the EU 
The German Government is pursuing a regional approach that includes not only assistance in Libya, which is a main departure point, but also a broad commitment to help in the most important countries of origin, as well as in the host and transit countries in the Sahel and in West Africa. 
Moreover, the German Government supports EU efforts to fight human trafficking. 
Together with Italy and the European Commission, the Federal Foreign Office co-funds a regional IOM project that seeks to improve migration management and promote voluntary return to the countries of origin. 
One of the aims is to keep people from embarking on the perilous journey across the Sahara and the Mediterranean. 
The German Government’s efforts are made within the context of the EU’s relevant activities and target the entire Mediterranean route. 
This year, the island state of Fiji holds the COP23 Presidency and, in conjunction with the UNFCCC, is inviting States Parties to take part in the conference. 
Germany is “organisational” host and is helping Fiji and the UNFCCC Secretariat to run COP 23, which will have around 20,000 participants. 
This bilateral agreement between the Federal Foreign Office and the UNFCCC Secretariat forms the legal basis for organising and holding the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 23), which will take place from 6 to 17 November in the Federal City of Bonn, 
The Federal Foreign Office has made available 4.5 million euros for this purpose. 
In addition, the Federal Foreign Office is providing 5.3 million euros in humanitarian aid for people in need in Libya. 
From now until 2018, the Federal Foreign Office will also make available 3.5 million euros to the UNHCR, as Foreign Minister Gabriel announced during his trip to Libya in early June. 
This project, to which the Federal Foreign Office is contributing 48 million euros over a three-year period, comprises Libya and 13 other countries in the Sahel region.

Dialogue on migration – Germany and Egypt sign agreement 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (28 August) before flying to Washington: 
An important step – the Agreement on Bilateral Dialogue on Migration 
Gabriel said that another question also needed to be addressed: 
“How can we ensure that people who are in Germany and are not able to stay here can return to Egypt promptly and in an orderly fashion?” 
Better cooperation on repatriation and a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of illegal migration are also included in the Agreement. 
Giving young Egyptians prospects for the future 
Speaking at the joint press conference, Foreign Minister Gabriel also stressed the “long tradition of good relations between Germany and Egypt”. 
Now is the time for diplomacy. 
The two countries enjoyed friendly ties and in-depth exchange, he said. 
Gabriel pointed out that Egypt’s stability was also very much in the interest of Europe and the world. 
Germany wanted to help ensure that young people in Egypt face a better future. 
Exchange between universities in the two countries was also “first rate”, he said. 
America is Europe’s most important ally. 
Even though we have not always been on the same wavelength recently: 
It is precisely because we have different views on key issues at the moment that we have to seek a dialogue with those willing to cooperate. 
For this we need to work closely with Washington. 
During the meeting, Germany and Egypt signed an Agreement on Bilateral Dialogue on Migration. 
Talks between the two Foreign Ministers 
and stressed the importance of investing in professional training for young people. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel underlined that the two countries wanted to work together to tackle the reasons why people migrate to Europe 
The Agreement thus includes both closer economic cooperation, as well as support for the Egyptian education sector and additional scholarships for young Egyptians to study in Germany. 
Foreign Minister Shoukry said this new cooperation with Germany on migration issues was an “important milestone in our relations”. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry at their joint press conference 
This involved the fight against terror, but also a further great challenge, namely that of providing young Egyptians with business opportunities and prospects for the future. 
During the joint press conference, Foreign Minister Gabriel also pointed out that there were more German schools in Egypt than in any other country in the world. 
It was a cause for pride that Egypt had so much faith in Germany as regards educating young people. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (28 August) on the situation in Rakhine, Myanmar: 
I have decided at short notice to fly to the United States today for the third time since taking up office to meet my American counterpart Rex Tillerson to discuss the problems we are facing at present. 
North Korea’s nuclear programme, the situation in Afghanistan, the crisis in Qatar, maintaining the nuclear agreement with Iran, the US sanctions against Russia – these are only some of the issues and crises currently weighing heavily on our minds. 
I was greatly concerned to hear the reports about the renewed violence which has cost more than 100 lives in the north of Myanmar’s Rakhine state. 
It was just three days ago, on 25 August, that the international Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by Kofi Annan presented its proposals for a “peaceful, fair and prosperous future for the people of Rakhine”. 
These recommendations, drawn up with input from national and international experts, are a crucial starting point for improving the human rights situation in Rakhine. 
Fully implementing them will open up development opportunities for everyone in Rakhine as well as possibilities for reconciliation in a highly complex conflict. 
The latest escalation of violence in northern Rakhine clearly demonstrates that a sustainable and comprehensive approach to resolving this conflict is needed now more than ever. 
I therefore call on all involved to do everything in their power to de-escalate the situation and to protect civil society. 
I call on the Myanmar Government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations, as it has said it will. 
Like the European Union, the German Government is ready to do all it can to support it through these challenging tasks. 
On 25 August 2017, an international Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented its final report containing detailed recommendations for the Myanmar Government. 
Comprising national and international experts, the commission has drawn up proposals for sustainably stabilising and improving the situation in Rakhine. 
The commission furthermore recommends fundamentally reviewing Myanmar’s citizenship laws and setting up an agency to implement its recommendations. 
According to Myanmar Government reports, there were attacks on police and army posts in northern Rakhine in the morning of 25 August, for which the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army has claimed responsibility. 
The violence has escalated in the subsequent days, and more than 100 people have lost their lives. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry on 27 August. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin on Sunday (27 August). 
With the aim of intensifying cooperation on migration issues, Germany and Egypt signed an Agreement on Bilateral Dialogue on Migration on Sunday (27 August). 
“First rate” – close cooperation in the education sector 
The country is seeing another wave of civilians fleeing their homes. 
Armed conflicts previously broke out in Rakhine as recently as October 2016, in the course of which the Myanmar army was accused of massive human rights violations. 
I very much regret that we have had to halt our humanitarian aid, with all international aid organisations being evacuated from northern Rakhine on 27 August, and I hope that it can start again quickly once the situation has calmed down. 
The proposals cover the economic and social development of Rakhine, resumption of the stagnating citizenship-verification process for Muslims in northern Rakhine, in connection with the re-establishment of freedom of movement, access for humanitarian organisations and the media, fundamental improvements to the education, healthcare and legal systems, action against cross-border drug trafficking, improvement of local communities’ political representation and closure of the internally displaced persons camps that have existed since 2012. 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the situation in Rakhine, Myanmar 
I am therefore glad that State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi has already welcomed the Kofi Annan Commission’s recommendations and initiated the first steps towards implementing them. 
The UN Human Rights Council has decided to set up an international commission of inquiry into the incidents, but the Myanmar Government has refused to cooperate. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy, issued the following statement today (29 August) on the arrest of Mehman Aliyev, director of the Azerbaijani news agency Turan: 
The investigation being carried out against Aliyev for tax evasion, illegal business activities and abuse of office, as well as the blocking of Turan’s bank accounts, have forced the agency to cease its work from 1 September. 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the arrest of Mehman Aliyev 
“I was very concerned to hear that Mehman Aliyev, director of the independent news agency Turan, has been arrested. 
This makes the situation regarding freedom of the press in Azerbaijan an even greater cause for concern than before. 
I call on the Azerbaijani Government to uphold the commitments it has made regarding freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the rule of law. 
I will continue to follow Mehman Aliyev’s case and the situation regarding freedom of the press in Azerbaijan closely.” 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on North Korea’s missile test 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (29 August) on the margins of his trip to Washington, DC: 
Early this morning, North Korea once again tested a ballistic missile, sending it directly over Japanese territory. 
Following his arrest on 24 August, Mehman Aliyev, director of the independent Azerbaijani news agency Turan, was remanded in custody for three months. 
He is accused of tax evasion, illegal business activities and abuse of office. 
Turan has been the only independent news agency in Azerbaijan for years. 
In Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, Azerbaijan is ranked 162 out of 180 countries. 
In the present situation, it is all the more important for the international community to rigorously implement the current sanctions regime, which aims to convince North Korea to abandon its illegal ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. 
I will meet with US Secretary of State Tillerson in Washington today; I will tell him that we support the diplomatic options through which the United States hopes to convince North Korea to return to the negotiating table. 
We very much welcome efforts to call for a special meeting of the UN Security Council, so that urgent talks can be held on how to de-escalate the dangerous crisis with North Korea. 
I am shocked at how brazenly North Korea is violating UN Security Council Resolutions and international law, putting the peace and security of people in its immediate neighbourhood recklessly at risk. 
In view of this threat, we share the anxiety of the Government and people of Japan, and we assure them of our full solidarity.

At the same time, it was important to continue trying to achieve a lasting ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. 
Meeting with Henry Kissinger 
Next stop Paris 
Gabriel is due to return to Europe on Wednesday morning: the Foreign Minister will take part in a session of the French Cabinet in Paris. 
Working closely with Washington – Foreign Minister Gabriel in the United States 
For the third time since taking up office, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is in the United States for talks on Tuesday (29 August). 
He is discussing pressing issues and crises in international politics with his counterpart Rex Tillerson. 
The time for diplomacy 
Departing for the United States: Gabriel’s third visit since taking up office © Kjer/photothek.net 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his American opposite number Rex Tillerson agreed at short notice to meet to discuss these important issues. 
“For this we need to work closely with Washington”, added Gabriel. 
America is Europe’s most important ally.” He stressed that especially in these difficult times it was crucial to seek a dialogue. 
They also had talks on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn and the G20 Summit in Hamburg. 
Focus on North Korea 
The meeting between the two ministers focused on the tense situation in North Korea. 
Gabriel emphasised that North Korea had still not understood that there was agreement in the international community that the missile tests and the nuclear programme had to stop. 
It was therefore right that the UN Security Council was meeting once more to discuss this issue. 
To that end, the Iranian side would have to ensure that every detail of the agreement was implemented. 
This objective should be pursued together with the United States. 
Referring to the US Congress sanctions against Russia, he went on to say that there should also be close coordination between the United States and the European partners in other areas. 
After his talks with Tillerson, Gabriel is to meet former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. 
“Now is the time for diplomacy”, said Foreign Minister Gabriel ahead of his departure for Washington, DC, referring to the agenda. 
Gabriel stated that Germany was keen to see the agreement upheld. 
“There should be no new ice age between Russia and the West”, said Gabriel. 
Talks on the current climate policy and on implementing the Paris Agreement are also on the agenda. 
For the third time since taking up office, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel was in the United States for talks on Tuesday (29 August). 
He discussed pressing issues and crises in international politics with his counterpart Rex Tillerson. 
One key issue was the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Gabriel spoke to Henry Kissinger about the dangers of nuclear armament. 
North Korea’s nuclear programme, the situation in Afghanistan, the crisis in Qatar, the nuclear agreement with Iran and the US sanctions against Russia: 
The meeting in Washington was Gabriel’s third encounter with his colleague. 
The nuclear agreement with Iran was also on the agenda. 
Meeting with Henry Kissinger: Supporting the Global Zero Initiative

After his talks with Tillerson, Gabriel met former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. 
The discussion focused on the danger of nuclear armament. 
Gabriel stated that more and more countries were accessing nuclear weapons. 
He added that more had to be done to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons, for: 
“Unfortunately, the risks Kissinger describes are more than realistic”. 
“It’s good to talk to someone who has been observing the international situation for a very long time”, said Gabriel. 
He went on to say that the case of North Korea showed how dangerous this situation was for the whole world. 
After leaving Washington, Gabriel headed for Paris where he is taking part in a session of the French Cabinet and attending the opening of the French Ambassadors Conference. 
Long-term goals 
A symbol of close friendship – 
The summer recess is over. On Wednesday (30 August), the French cabinet met again for the first time following a short break. 
Symbol of Franco-German friendship 
Gabriel had only returned from the United States during the night, travelling directly from Washington to Paris. 
His visit to Washington was one topic on the agenda of the cabinet meeting, along with the fight against IS, the situation in Qatar and Syria, and Europe’s relations with Turkey. 
Focus on Europe

Germany and France will continue to work closely together on Europe and the future of the European Union. 
The aim is to now build on the results of this meeting. 
French Ambassadors Conference 
After attending the cabinet meeting, Gabriel took part in the opening of the French Ambassadors Conference – a further sign of the close relations between Germany and France.

Gabriel sees three topics as priorities in the near future: internal cohesion in the European Union, joint strategies in view of global refugee and migrant movements, and internal and external security, 
In his speech to the French Ambassadors Conference, Gabriel said that cooperation in the Franco-German tandem played an important role. 
“If not us, Germany and France, then who should join forces to find solutions to these key questions of our time?” 
Naturally, this close cooperation must take an inclusive approach “as the heart of a deeper European Union”, Gabriel concluded. 
Berlin meeting, “Responsibility of religions for peace” (PDF, 21 MB) 
They are strong social and political forces within their societies and there are impressive examples of religiously inspired peacemaking. 
In the last few years, however, they have frequently been represented as the cause of terror, violence and repression. 
Yet religions aspire to be peaceable, and there are impressive examples of religiously inspired peacemaking. 
Since autumn 2016, the Federal Foreign Office has therefore stepped up its efforts to make religious communities strategic partners in the work to promote peace. 
Conference in Berlin in 2017: 100 religious representatives from 53 countries

At the invitation of Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who made the opening speech, 100 religious representatives from 53 countries came together. 
Regional, as well as country and theme-specific formats are to be developed to interconnect and strengthen the peace efforts of local players. 
Our concrete goals are to: 
anchor the responsibility of religions for peace in German foreign policy 
heighten awareness of the peacemaking potential of religions 
showcase positive examples of practical work for peace by religious communities 
Conference participants greet each other warmly © photothek.net 
Especially in the sphere of cultural relations and education policy, the Federal Foreign Office has many partners and mediators who are forging these contacts at various levels. 
The mandate of the Task Force on the Responsibility of the Religions for Peace is to intensify cooperation with religious communities around the world. 
Feel free to contact us if you have any ideas for our work. 
The conference in Berlin marked the start of efforts to develop a global network of religious representatives working for peace in their countries and communities. 
Gabriel attends meeting of the French cabinet 
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel attended the meeting as a special guest 
Sigmar Gabriel’s participation in a meeting of the French cabinet on Wednesday (30 August) chaired by President Emmanuel Macron is a sign of the close friendship between Germany and France. Gabriel is the second German Foreign Minister to attend a meeting of the French cabinet after his predecessor Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who attended a meeting in May 2014. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble was the first German minister to attend a meeting of the French cabinet in 2010 as a guest of then President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
The 19th joint Franco-German Council of Ministers took place just a few weeks ago, on 13 July. 
The focus here was also on the future of the European Union. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement on this today (30 August): 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the increase in the Central Emergency Response Fund 
In these four countries alone, 21 million people urgently need humanitarian assistance such as food, safe drinking water and healthcare. 
The Federal Foreign Office does justice to the importance of CERF for humanitarian assistance. 
UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O’Brien has authorised the release of 45 million dollars from CERF for particularly neglected and under-financed crises. 
The funds in CERF, which are contributed by UN Member States, enable the aid organisations that receive support to intervene in crisis situations at an early stage. 
As well as providing support for acute crises, CERF pays particular attention to forgotten and under-financed crises in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. 
Humanitarian assistance 
The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is providing a further 45 million dollars for particularly under-financed humanitarian crises. 
“We must not forget lesser-known crises and the people affected by them. 
Germany has been a major supporter of CERF, both politically and financially, since the Fund’s establishment in 2005 
and has increased its contribution further this year 
to 60 million euros, thus making it one of the most important donors to CERF. 
In this way, Germany is enabling CERF to continue its important work in the world’s crisis-hit regions. 
On Monday (28 August), UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O’Brien released further funds from CERF. 
Previously under-financed humanitarian aid projects in four countries (Afghanistan, Chad, the Sudan and the Central African Republic) will receive 45 million dollars in aid overall as a result. 
meaning that humanitarian assistance can be provided quickly in an emergency situation. 
The Federal Foreign Office has been supporting CERF’s work politically and financially for years. 
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is tasked with monitoring CERF. 
CERF attaches particular importance to providing funding to humanitarian emergencies that have been largely forgotten by the public and humanitarian donors. 
Thanks to its rapid response capability, CERF has provided life-saving aid to many millions of people since its establishment in 2005. Every year, an average of 20 million people are provided with medical care, a further 10 million receive food and 8 million water. 
Other donors are also called upon to support the work of CERF. 
In 2016, Germany provided 50 million euros to the Fund. It has increased its contribution to 60 million euros for 2017. 
Although it has a broad basis of 125 Member States as well as private donors, recent figures indicate that the ten largest donors (including Germany) contribute 87 percent of its funding. 
CERF facilitates a rapid response to acute humanitarian crises, 
The Federal Foreign Office would like to make use of this potential and established the Task Force on the Responsibility of the Religions for Peace in autumn 2016. 
Many of Germany’s foreign policy objectives are the same as those of faith-based players: 
In addition to that, political and diplomatic authorities can empower religious communities by giving them a greater visibility. 
In addition to these guests, some 400 German participants from churches, religious communities and academia took part in the opening event. 
Subsequently, religion and the media, peace education, mediation, interfaith councils, as well as religion and politics, were examined in workshops. 
build sustainable and trust-based relations with religious representatives around the world 
This funding will enable aid organisations in Afghanistan, Chad, the Sudan and the Central African Republic to help people in need to live in dignity. 
In disaster situations, CERF provides rapid funding to aid organisations so that help reaches the people in need as quickly as possible.

Fortieth anniversary of the Brandt Commission – visionary ideas now and then 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel discussed this question today (31 August) with participants of the #Brandt2030 conference in Berlin

In the same way that the Brandt Commission’s recommendations were ahead of their time, “we continue to face the great challenge of making the world a genuinely fairer place”. 
He called for nuclear disarmament and arms control to be put back on the international community’s agenda, 
saying that it was important to launch a “new trend towards global disarmament”. 
Discussion among young leaders about shaping the future 
Quoting Willy Brandt, Foreign Minister Gabriel said that “the shaping of our common future is much too important to be left to governments and experts alone”. 
The challenges as regards sustainable, peaceful and fair globalisation were the main topic of three panel discussions at the conference. 
and said that working to create a fairer world is “the crucial key to facilitating peaceful coexistence in the 21st century”. 
The Independent Commission on International Development Issues chaired by Willy Brandt began its work 40 years ago. 
In 1980 and 1982, it published reports containing recommendations on key issues of global economic policy and political governance, including world trade, disarmament, migration, poverty, population growth and global institutions. 
In his speech, Foreign Minister Gabriel said that the Brandt Commission’s ideas and suggestions were visionary at the time 
and that many of them remained equally relevant today. 
At the time, Willy Brandt predicted that these ideas would be “taken back off the shelf” again in the future. 
And that was exactly what was now being done, Foreign Minister Gabriel said in his speech. 
Making the world fairer – and a safe and good place for future generations to live 
If we succeed in this, “we will also make the world a safe and good place for our children’s and grandchildren’s generations to live”, Gabriel said. 
With a view to the current developments on the Korean Peninsula, Gabriel warned about the dangers of a heavily armed world. 
as many of the participants were young leaders from the spheres of politics, business and civil society from Germany and abroad. 
He was thus delighted to have the opportunity to speak with a large number of young people from all over the world at the conference, 
The recommendations by what became known as the Brandt Commission laid the foundations for the Sustainable Development Goals recently formulated by the United Nations in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
Statement by Gernot Erler on the entry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement 
Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation with Russia, Central Asia and the Eastern Partnership Countries, issued the following statement today (1 September) on the entry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement: 
Germany and the entire EU stand resolutely shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. 
I congratulate Ukraine on this special occasion and hope that all Ukrainians will remember this day as an historic milestone on the path to ever-closer cooperation with the EU and its Member States. 
Support for Ukraine 
Following the easing of visa requirements in June this year, this is another very special day for the EU and its Member States, but especially for Ukraine. 
We recall that the Yanukovych Government’s refusal to sign the Association Agreement, despite promises to the contrary made to the public, led to the Euromaidan protests and played a crucial role in the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine. 
The Agreement enables Ukraine to have closer ties with the EU, its economic area and its values. 
We hope that Ukraine will make use of the opportunity to further its political and social transformation process by fully implementing the reforms agreed in the Association Agreement and DCFTA. 
That is the prerequisite for stability and prosperity in the country and the best protection against destabilisation attempts from abroad. 
Particularly in poorer countries, many people are fleeing from rising sea levels and recurring drought. 
Germany therefore hosted a meeting of experts on “Displacement caused by climate change and natural disasters”. 
The humanitarian challenge 
Millions of people around the world are fleeing natural disasters and the effects of climate change. 
Meeting of experts in Berlin 
Chairmanship of the Platform on Disaster Displacement 
Germany assumed the Chairmanship of the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) in 2016. 
The Federal Foreign Office is working hard in the context of the Chairmanship to improve the protection of populations against natural disasters and the effects of climate change. 
Climate Change 
Platform on Disaster Displacement 
A German disaster risk reduction project 
IOM Global Migration 
Flooding, hurricanes and mudslides – these days, millions of people already face the threat of natural disasters. 
Due to climate change, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. 
Displacement caused by climate change is one of the key humanitarian challenges of the 21st century. 
At the symposium in Berlin, Atle Solberg of the Platform on Disaster Displacement said: 
In future, the number of displaced persons who cross international borders is set to increase. 
Every country may need to confront the issue of cross-border displacement resulting from disasters, either as a country of origin, transit or destination. 
We must better prepare ourselves to deal with such displacement and redouble our efforts in this regard.” 
For example, the Federal Foreign Office supports a pilot project that the German Red Cross is conducting in Peru and that was awarded a prize in the 2017 Land of Ideas competition. With detailed weather forecast data, it aims to better predict cold snaps and other natural events in the Andean Mountains, so that the affected population can be given humanitarian aid before an emergency arises. 
In less developed and less stable countries, the population is particularly strongly affected by flooding and drought – which often threaten people’s livelihoods. 
“Displacement caused by disasters or resulting from climate change is already a reality today. 
Germany has been engaged at international level for many years to improve disaster risk reduction, so that people in affected regions are better prepared to deal with impending disasters. 
Displacement caused by climate change and natural disasters – Germany is working to help with preparedness and protect those affected 
As part of the Migration & Development Series, experts met in Berlin on 31 August 2017 to discuss the humanitarian consequences of climate change. 
Over the last 20 years, the number of natural disasters has increased from approximately 200 to 400 per year, and this number continues to rise. 
As part of the Migration & Development Series, experts met on 31 August 2017 to discuss the humanitarian consequences of climate change. 
“The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed in March and June 2014, enters fully into force today.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on North Korea’s nuclear test 
This news is a source of great concern. 
On behalf of the Federal Government, I condemn North Korea’s behaviour in the strongest possible terms. 
Through its actions, North Korea is deliberately adding fuel to the already very tense situation on the Korean peninsula. 
Once again, the regime is demonstrating that it poses a serious threat to world peace. 
This threat affects us all. 
We now therefore need to work together to find a considered but clear response. 
We will discuss this response with our partners in the EU. 
Following confirmation also from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), we must assume that North Korea conducted a sixth nuclear test last night. 
If it turns out to be true, this act would constitute a further blatant violation of international law and applicable UN Security Council resolutions. 
The current tense situation on the Korean peninsula and the emerging debate on nuclear armament between East and West shows all too clearly how much we need disarmament, arms control and initiatives for a world without nuclear weapons. 
Launch a new trend towards global disarmament 
Situation on the Korean peninsula: 
A danger for the whole world 
The most recent developments on the Korean peninsula reveal the potential for escalation when individual states start trying to get access to nuclear weapons. 
Should North Korea succeed in doing so, there will be repercussions for the entire south-east Asian region. 
Concern about the possible erosion of the INF Treaty 
which is a central element of the existing disarmament and arms control architecture. 
“This very quickly leads to the question of whether there is a need to develop new nuclear strategies in Europe.” 
Meeting with the Deep Cuts Commission © Photothek.net/M. Gottschalk 
All nuclear disarmament and arms control treaties concluded by Gorbachev and Reagan were in grave danger. 
Europe again faced the threat of having to host large numbers of nuclear missiles, he continued. 
Launch a new trend towards global disarmament now 
To prevent this, he said, it was time to “launch a new trend towards global disarmament”. 
Take a lead and adhere to treaties 
Talks with Henry Kissinger: How to stop the spread of nuclear weapons? 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Henry Kissinger © Photothek.net/Inga Kjer 
The question of how to stop the spread of nuclear weapons was one Foreign Minister Gabriel also discussed with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during his trip to the United States (28 August). 
Henry Kissinger has been campaigning for a world without nuclear weapons for many years with the Global Zero Initiative. 
“We should all support this Initiative”, stressed Gabriel. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel after his talks with the Deep Cuts Commission © Photothek/M. Gottschalk 
I am sure that the UN Security Council, too, will demonstrate great unity once again in taking the necessary measures. 
This critical situation highlights the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the International Monitoring System on which it is based. Its worldwide network of monitoring stations was the first to register and report the unusually high seismic activity. 
Heading into a Cold War 2.0? 
In this context, he went on, Germany in particular must raise its voice as a force for peace and work to prevent an arms race. 
Minister of State Böhmer commented as follows. 
The World Heritage designation is not only an award, but also an obligation to protect cultural heritage of outstanding universal value. 
We want to protect cultural and natural heritage worldwide.

She underlined the importance of the long tradition of research in the region. 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer visits the site where the “Venus of Hohle Fels” was found 
The Ice Age artworks found in this and four other caves in the region were inscribed as World Cultural Heritage last month. 
Constant research work 
For this reason, it was important to have good visitor centres and several small museums in the region. 
The objects found in the caves are between 32,000 and 43,000 years old - and thus the oldest artworks in the world.

These finds are evidence of humankind’s first major cultural breakthrough. 
This is a task in which we in Germany and the international community must work in concert.” 
In her speech, Minister of State Böhmer thanked all those who had worked to secure the site’s recognition as World Cultural Heritage and congratulated the people of Schelklingen. 
Without this constant research work, it would not have been possible to prove the caves’ outstanding universal importance, she said. 
The challenge was now to enable the large number of interested visitors to view the sites and research findings without damaging the archaeological sites. 
Inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, visited the Ice Age cave, Hohle Fels, near Schelklingen in Swabia in southwest Germany on 28 August. 
Protecting cultural and natural heritage worldwide 
“These objects – the oldest in the history of humankind – are breathtaking. 
Not only was the ‘Venus of Hohle Fels’, the world’s oldest depiction of a woman, found here, but also a large number of other artworks and several musical instruments. 
Archaeological digs were first carried out in Hohle Fels cave in the 1860s. 
At the 41st meeting of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Kraków on 9 July, it was unanimously decided to inscribe the caves and Ice Age art in the Swabian Jura in the UNESCO World Heritage List. 
The site is the latest addition to the 42 UNESCO World Heritage sites in Germany. 
The world’s oldest examples of figurative art and musical instruments made of ivory and bones were discovered in the six caves. These include the “Venus of Hohle Fels”, the oldest depiction of a woman, as well as the ivory mammoth figurine from Vogelherd Cave and the half-lion, half-human figurine from Höhlenstein‑Stadel. 
“But then,” he went on, “we would be living in a world that is more dangerous than back in the days of two blocs, East and West”. 
“unfortunately, the risks Kissinger describes are more than realistic”. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel warns of the dangers of a heavily armed world and calls for a new trend towards global disarmament. 
“And once that happens, another part of the world, too, will wonder whether its government can be protected and defended by procuring nuclear weapons,” said Foreign Minister Gabriel. 
The United States has on several occasions publicly stated that Russia is violating the INF Treaty on the elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. 
The German Government is concerned about the danger of the erosion of this Treaty, 
A debate was emerging, Gabriel said: 
The world was currently heading into a Cold War 2.0, said Foreign Minister Gabriel, quoting the Deep Cuts Commission. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said he feared that “the worst mistakes of the Cold War” were being repeated. 
If Russia and NATO were to take a lead and put arms control and nuclear disarmament back on the agenda, it could release strong forces to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons in many other countries, said the German Foreign Minister. 
Looking to shape a fairer, peaceful world, Gabriel appealed to all in positions of responsibility not to abandon existing arms control treaties, and to help bring about a new trend towards disarmament. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel to open international conference on the future of conventional arms control 
Patricia Flor, Federal Government Commissioner for Disarmament and Arms Control, and Adam Thomson, Director of the European Leadership Network, will join Foreign Minister Gabriel in opening the event. 
In view of increasing armament worldwide and growing concern about security in Europe, Foreign Minister Gabriel is calling for a new start in conventional arms control. 
At the conference, policymakers and academics will discuss how international arms control architecture can be maintained and furthered. 
Global relevance of COP 23

Germany as a hub for climate action 
For participants ranging from Heads of State and Ministers to CEOs of major companies, civil society and young people, Germany will be the hub for global climate action in November. 
Signing of agreement on the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn in 2017 
State Secretary Walter J. Lindner and the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, signed a bilateral agreement in Bonn on 4 September that forms the legal basis for organising and hosting the 23rd UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23). 
The conference will take place in Bonn, seat of the UNFCCC Secretariat, from 6 to 17 November. 
State Secretary Walter J. Lindner commented as follows on the signing of the agreement on COP 23 today (4 September 2017): 
The UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23) in Bonn is therefore of particular global relevance. 
Once again, Bonn has an opportunity to demonstrate its calibre as a UN city and as a conference location.” 
And Bonn is a UN city and is now truly becoming a sustainability hub.” 
Diplomats, politicians and representatives of civil society from around the world will meet in Bonn in November. 
Executive Seminar for Diplomats from Central Asia 
The first Executive Seminar for young diplomats from Central Asia is taking place in September 2017. 
Another aim is to convey a positive image of Germany and to familiarise our guests with the objectives of German foreign policy. 
Talks and discussions will be held at the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Chancellery, and also with the GIZ, political foundations and academic institutes. 
Participants will also attend lectures on German and European contemporary history, the German federal political system and international law, and will also receive media training. 
A study trip to the Free State of Saxony with visits to Dresden (State Chancellery), Leipzig (BMW factory), Görlitz (German-Polish border management) and Freiberg (mining academy) will offer them practical insights. 
German approaches and practical experiences regarding the focal topic of the programme will be presented by the directorate for social cohesion and integration at the Federal Ministry of the Interior. 
Statement by Federal Minister Gabriel on North Korea – video subtitles 
The Executive Seminar will be held in English. 
The entire international community was shocked that North Korea carried out a major nuclear bomb test, its largest ever, despite all the warnings from abroad. 
That is why we urgently need to increase our pressure on North Korea to attend talks in order to ensure that there are no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. 
And I think we will be in great danger if North Korea gets its way – other countries will then also start acquiring nuclear weapons, and not only in the neighbouring region. A new trend will develop. 
This means that we will have to add further individuals and companies to the sanctions list and, most importantly, close European ports to North Korean ships, even if they are travelling under another flag. 
And the third thing we should do is to enforce an agreement in Europe not to employ any “guest workers” from North Korea, as all revenues received by the state go in part to nuclear weapons programmes. Europe – just like China and Russia – must take a clear stand on this. 
The Human Rights Commissioner on the hunger strike in Rajai Shahr Prison, Iran 
The focus of the four-week course is on conflict prevention and deradicalisation, issues that are currently relevant to our participants’ countries of origin in particular. 
Further components of the further training initiative include an additional study trip to Vienna (to the OSCE and other international organisations), mediation training, a case study on the role of religions in foreign policy and a planning exercise on deradicalisation. 
Visits to the Violence Prevention Network NGO and the Neukölln borough authority, where an integration model is to be presented, are intended to illustrate the operative implementation of policies. 
Attendees hail from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
Following reports about the critical condition of several Iranian political prisoners on hunger strike in Rajai Shahr Prison, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, issued the following statement today (5 September): 
Very worrying news has reached me from Iran in recent days. 
They are not receiving appropriate healthcare, and their families and lawyers are not allowed to visit. 
This violates the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified.

Over a dozen political detainees in Rajai Shahr Prison who are on hunger strike in protest at their transfer to the high‑security wing and the inhumane conditions under which they are being held are in a very critical condition. 
I call upon the Iranian Government and all in positions of responsibility within the judicial system to fulfil their obligation to ensure humane treatment of all prisoners. 
Over a dozen political detainees in Rajai Shahr Prison in Karaj, near Tehran, have embarked on a hunger strike in protest at their inhumane and degrading treatment.

The prisoners – including Mehdi Khazali, who was in a coma for a while, and the journalist Alireza Rajaei, who is suffering from cancer – are not receiving adequate medical care. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (6 September) on the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding the relocation of refugees from Greece and Italy to Member States throughout Europe. 
The CJEU ruling is crystal clear. 
This was true in the past, and it is especially true today, considering the current challenges. 
I’ve always told our Eastern European partners that it is right for the courts to clarify any issues or doubts that may arise. 
What we can – and do – expect to happen now is that all European partners will comply with the ruling and implement the respective decisions without delay. 
It has now been legally established once and for all that the European solidarity that was agreed by the Council not only conforms to European values, but is also fully in line with EU law. 
European partners must be able to rely on one another, also concerning difficult decisions. 
“Europe’s strength is the strength of the law” 
Europe’s strength is the strength of the law – it is the bedrock on which European cohesion is built. 
Solidarity is not a one‑way street. 
It ruled that the majority decision in Europe 
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,440 will now apply this ruling. 
to relocate refugees fairly in Europe is legal 
and complies with European treaties, and that all EU member states must adhere to it. 
because they trusted it and because it was the right place for them, 
That is what one can expect in Europe, in a legal entity based on the strength of the law. 
The Court of Justice of the European Union issued a very important and groundbreaking verdict today. 
We now trust that the member states that took this case to the Court of Justice of the European Union 
And that is what we now expect from all those who brought the actions. 
Making arms control fit for the 21st century 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on his meeting with Nikola Dimitrov, Foreign Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (6 September) on his meeting with Nikola Dimitrov, Foreign Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 
At the conference “Making Conventional Arms Control Fit for the 21st Century,” policymakers and academics are discussing how the international arms control architecture can be maintained and further developed. 
“We are entering a new arms race.” 
Disarmament a matter of war and peace 
With respect to the latest developments on the Korean peninsula, Gabriel warned that if North Korea were to succeed with its aggressive nuclear programme, other states would also think about getting nuclear weapons. 
Early this year, I launched an initiative to reinvigorate the Berlin Process that was established in 2014. 
I am pleased that initial proposals were endorsed at the Western Balkans Summit in Trieste in July. 
Together with our partners in the EU, we are working to further increase our support. 
The reforms must be implemented. 
Germany and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: bilateral relations 
However, when addressing the issue of nuclear disarmament, you also had to look beyond the worrying situation in North Korea. 
Patricia Flor, Federal Government Commissioner for Disarmament and Arms Control, and Adam Thomson, Director of the European Leadership Network, joined Foreign Minister Gabriel in opening the event. 
The Government has gotten off to an impressive start and is taking visible action. It is tackling ambitious reforms and taking positive steps toward its neighbours. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel also met with OSCE Secretary General Greminger on the sidelines of the event. 
I congratulate my counterpart Nikola Dimitrov, the new Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Prime Minister Zaev on their first hundred days. 
Stopping a new arms race and improving disarmament controls 
The event will explore how best to maintain conventional arms controls in the 21st century and how to make further progress in this field.

Foreign Minister Gabriel delivering his opening speech 
This is the only way for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to draw closer to the EU and to NATO. 
I also want to specifically call on the current opposition to not block the new Government’s positive momentum and to remain open to constructive cooperation with the Government. 
Failing to do so would be detrimental not only to the country’s prospects of EU membership, but also to those people in the country who are hoping for real progress and improvements in their situation. 
no rebates will be given during the accession process. 
However, he stressed, what we needed to aim for was disarmament. 
The issue of disarmament had once again “become a matter of war and peace,” he said, noting that 
we now had to doggedly work step by small step towards disarmament. 
We provide both political and practical support, by offering advice and tangible assistance. 
Nevertheless, it is also true that 
It is now vital for the announced reforms to actually be implemented and for the reform process in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to get moving again. 
Germany supports the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s ambitions to draw closer to the EU and to NATO – as it does similar ambitions of the other countries in the Western Balkans.

In order to prevent the North Korean example from setting a precedent, he stated that further pressure should be brought to bear on the country as a matter of urgency, such as through further sanctions. 
The situation in the Middle East was also on the agenda alongside North Korea. 
Negotiations between Israel and Palestine are currently at a standstill. 
The continuation of the Middle East Peace Process will therefore also be a topic of discussion at the Gymnich meeting.

The European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy and fighting radicalisation and extremism are also on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ talks. 
The focus of their talks is on the situation in North Korea and the continuation of the Middle East Peace Process. 
The Foreign Ministers are convening in Estonia’s capital Tallinn for their informal meeting this September. 
Prior to the meeting, Gabriel said that the international community had been shocked to discover that North Korea had carried out a further nuclear test in spite of the warnings issued across the globe. 
A common position on the part of the EU member states was an important part of this, he added. 
Informal EU Foreign Ministers meeting 
The Foreign Ministers of the EU member states meet in the informal Gymnich format on two occasions each year. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opened a two‑day international conference on the future of arms control in Berlin on Wednesday (6 September). 
The conference title – Making Conventional Arms Control Fit for the 21st Century – says it all. 
In his opening speech, Foreign Minister Gabriel said we were now departing from the course steered since the end of the Cold War. 
What was important now, Gabriel stated, were not the geostrategic considerations of the 20th century, but changing the emphasis and making arms control fit for the 21st century.

The USA and Russia bore a special responsibility when it came to taking steps towards nuclear disarmament. 
Expert discussions at the two‑day conference 
International experts, NGO representatives and governmental representatives from many of the 57 OSCE participating states have come together for the discussions at this two-day conference. 
Following the most recent nuclear weapons test in North Korea, the tense situation on the Korean peninsula is the focus of their talks. The objective is to develop a common European position and to agree on a considered yet clear approach to dealing with the regime in Pyongyang. The important role played by Russia and China is also a key topic in this regard. 
Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the opening of the conference 
Let me open with words spoken by a man concerned about peace. 
A peace researcher, if you will. 
He says: 
“I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living.” 
This peace researcher then proposes the exact opposite. He demands, and I quote, “general and complete disarmament”. 
In the middle of the Cold War, the American President spoke about peace as the “necessary rational end of rational men”. 
He was firmly anchored in the Western Alliance. 
Millions of people are fleeing terror and hunger in the Lake Chad region in western Africa. 
Terror and hunger are threatening millions of people in the Lake Chad region. 
North Korea and the Middle East – 
Sigmar Gabriel attended an informal meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers in Estonia on Thursday (7 September). 
The talks focused on the tense situation in North Korea and a joint European response to it. 
The continuation of the Middle East peace process was also discussed. 
Following the latest nuclear weapon test in North Korea, the Foreign Ministers’ talks focused on the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. 
This is what representatives from these countries agreed at the first meeting of the Lake Chad Consultative Group in Berlin on Wednesday.

such as massive environmental degradation and dramatic supply shortages, as well as the brutal terror of Boko Haram. 
More than two million people have been forced to flee their homes. 
It was also important to find out who was supplying North Korea with the technical means to develop nuclear weapons. 
Greater cooperation: 
The situation in the Middle East was also on the agenda alongside North Korea. 
The European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy and fighting radicalisation and extremism were also on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ talks. 
The Middle East peace process 
When hardship and violence spread across borders, a cross-border solution becomes necessary. 
The governors from the border region of Nigeria, Chad, the Niger and Cameroon will therefore meet at regular intervals in the future in order to improve the way in which they coordinate their response to the crisis. 
The Federal Foreign Office is helping affected states to tackle the crisis together. 
Finding a considered and clear European response to North Korea 
Nevertheless, the balance of terror, Brandt insisted, must “take a second seat to the attempt to solve problems peacefully without any illusions”. 
That, he said, is the right strategy for peace. 
Why am I referring to Kennedy and Brandt? 
The aim was to draw up a joint European position and to agree on a considered and clear response to the regime in Pyongyang. 
After the meeting, Foreign Minister Gabriel said the world would become a very dangerous place should North Korea start a trend and other countries follow in its footsteps as regards trying to acquire nuclear weapons. 
In order to help restore lasting peace, the reintegration of former fighters into society is being supported, for example. 
“The Cold War era would seem relatively safe compared with what we would experience in such a situation,” he said. 
As a result, Gabriel said, it was important to react firmly as a European community. 
As a first step, the United Nations Security Council’s current sanctions must be implemented consistently. 
The Federal Foreign Office is committing over 50 million euros to this cause. 
Gabriel advocated tighter sanctions in other areas, calling for European ports to be closed to North Korean ships and North Korean workers in Europe to be sent home. 
All of the measures are aimed at cutting off flows of finance to North Korea that can be used for its nuclear programme. 
At the same time, Gabriel underlined the need to continue using diplomatic channels. 
He also expressed his explicit support for the approach taken by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson – in exchange for North Korea not pursuing a nuclear programme, the United States will not call for a change of regime, intervene in any way or conduct military operations. 
Should the regime be receiving support from other countries, the international community should also exert economic pressure on these countries to persuade them to change course. 
The continuation of the Middle East peace process was therefore also a topic of discussion at the Gymnich meeting. 
Germany has already contributed 90 million euros of humanitarian assistance this year to avert a famine. 
where the first meeting of this kind took place, back in 1974, under the chairmanship of then Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
It is important to improve the quality of life of people in the region to prevent even greater numbers of people from having to flee their homes. 
It was one of the darkest hours of the Cold War. 
In particular, Germany is working to strengthen the joint efforts being made to improve crisis prevention and achieve greater stability. 
Together with the United Nations, Germany has already launched projects to bring stability to the region. 
The projects are encouraging a dialogue between various perpetrators’ and victims’ groups in order to facilitate reconciliation. 
The affected countries are being supported in their efforts to improve emergency aid in the conflict-stricken region themselves and to ensure greater security for the population. 
Cooperation and interconnectivity play a key role in this regard. 
It was with this in mind that the Lake Chad Consultative Group was set up at Germany’s initiative. 
Together with the United Nations, Germany and Norway, Nigeria, Chad, the Niger and Cameroon use this forum to discuss how cross-border cooperation can be improved. 
This is precisely where Germany’s assistance comes into play. 
Cooperation is key 
Right now, we are in danger of losing historic achievements. 
China, which can exert great influence on the regime in Pyongyang, played an important role here. 
These are scientists from Russia, the United States and Germany who for many years have been dealing with the issue of nuclear disarmament. 
They point to cracks in a crucial building block of our global security architecture: 
United against the terror of Boko Haram 
High-ranking officials from countries bordering Lake Chad – Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and Chad – as well as representatives from various African regional organisations and important international partners such as the United Nations, the G7, Norway, the European Union and the World Bank met at the invitation of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Germany is focusing on long‑term assistance 
State Secretary Walter Lindner speaking at the conference in Berlin 
The meeting takes its name from the German Government’s former guest house in the Rhineland, 
It is precisely this treaty that is under threat. 
Beginning in 1990, tens of thousands of tanks and other heavy weapon systems were destroyed under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the so-called CFE Treaty. Moreover, a verifiable limit was placed on the future number of these weapon systems. 
Second, 
the state of confidence-building measures, for example those regarding military exercises in border regions, is not good: 
The internet sites have been blocked without any due process. 
This is a particularly severe form of censorship and a grievous violation of freedom of opinion and media freedom. 
Free and unimpeded access to information for all is a key prerequisite for a functioning state and for the long-term viability of any society. 
Respect for human rights is a basic prerequisite for social harmony and lasting stability, and also the best defence against radicalisation and extremism. 
I call on Egypt to create conditions in which the independent media and human rights representatives can do their work unhindered – work that is important for the country. 
Yesterday access to the site of Human Rights Watch was blocked, two days after it published a report criticising torture in Egypt. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the suspension of websites in Egypt 
I am profoundly concerned by the fact that online access to more and more websites of independent media outlets and human rights organisations is being blocked in Egypt. One of the latest organisations to suffer this fate is Human Rights Watch. 
This move deprives the organisations affected of a key communication channel and is obviously designed to silence them. 
The sites were all blocked without any legal procedures being followed, and without any official announcement. 
The organisations affected thus had no opportunity to present a legal defence. 
Access in Egypt to numerous independent Egyptian and foreign media websites has been blocked since May 2017. Since August 2017, human rights organisations’ websites have also been suspended. 
It is one of a series of repressive measures adopted against the independent media, human rights defenders and civil society organisations in Egypt. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (8 September) on the suspension of independent media and human rights websites in Egypt: 
So what do we do? 
For this, we need those with political responsibility to change how they think and act. 
But I do envy one thing that they and their successors had: a broad public debate on disarmament. 
Looking around, I don’t see this international debate. 
According to NGOs, the number of websites to which access has been blocked in this way has now reached 424. 
The fact that the public was keeping a critical eye on, and often drove, government policy, is at least one reason why good results were achieved in this truly important policy area. 
I’ll give you an example. 
In 1986, Reagan and Gorbachev met for a summit in Reykjavik. 
The entire world is talking about rearmament. Nuclear treaties are under strain. This applies to New START as well as to the recently concluded nuclear deal with Iran. 
To further complicate the situation, the agreed mechanisms for conventional arms control are not working, even though these instruments were designed with difficult times in mind. 
When one invites the other side as an observer precisely for this reason, and when one visits the other side to keep an eye on what they’re doing. 
That’s important, no doubt. 
Of course, these days we also need security vis-à-vis one another. 
But that alone is not a permanent solution. 
We must get back to a multilateral system that guarantees security through cooperation, as a basis for maintaining permanent peace. 
“General and complete disarmament” like Kennedy envisioned will not be attained overnight – that should be clear to everyone. 
Yet that is precisely why I am convinced that we must take many small concrete steps in a determined effort to reach this goal. 
And our fist step should be to promote the instruments of arms control and confidence-building measures. 
This includes doing everything we can to prevent the undermining of treaties that have proven their worth. 
On the other hand, it means taking the initiative to create new arms control and disarmament mechanisms, wherever necessary. 
This includes establishing rules for unregulated domains, for example, autonomous weapons. 
“give peace a chance”. 
But we also want to make offers to pursue arms control and disarmament – particularly in Europe. 
For this, it is important to include all European countries, in much the way this is already happening in the OSCE. 
That is why we used our OSCE Chairmanship in 2016 to intensively campaign for a modernisation of the Vienna Document, and we continue to pursue this goal. 
That bears risks and dangers! 
New momentum is needed in the nuclear domain, as well. 
Of course, one priority must be to contain North Korea. 
But we must think beyond this, as well. 
Nevertheless, we have argued that our efforts at this point should focus on achieving a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. 
So we said: 
Let’s think about whether we could get a United Nations peacekeeping mission deployed there. 
So far, Russia has always said 
Ukraine has said, and I think it’s a justified demand, that as long as there is no ceasefire, there can be no talks about elections in eastern Ukraine. 
We think this makes sense and have pointed out to Russia: 
“In Syria, you say there must first be a ceasefire, followed by peace negotiations in Geneva – why shouldn’t it be the same for eastern Ukraine?” 
We know that. 
I can still remember the depressing images from last winter, when for example the water supply was cut off and waste water treatment was interrupted. 
I think this is an area where we can help. 
But before we get to that point, there will be many weeks and possibly also months of negotiations about the proposal. 
I think that would be the wrong thing to do. 
We must take a proactive approach, by looking at how the proposal can be implemented, and how, as a next step, we can gradually and truly de-escalate the situation. 
If there is a voice that has a vested interest in the opposite development, then I think it’s the voice of Europe, and of Germany. 
Twenty years ago, no one would have imagined how rapidly troops can be assembled and heavy military equipment deployed over long distances. 
We Germans must remain a force for peace, and we must work hard to prevent an arms race. However, to this end, we must also look at our own country’s policies. 
The Brandt Commission’s final report included a very impressive finding: The military expenditure of only half a day would suffice to finance the whole malaria eradication programme of the World Health Organization. 
I think this is food for thought. 
What we actually need is much more money to spend on the fight against hunger, poverty and lagging development, as well as to fund education and research. 
Indeed, it’s about charting a new course, in line with the policies of peace researchers such as Kennedy and Brandt, and others after them. 
It’s the first step toward disarmament and détente. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the situation in Myanmar 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (8 September) on the situation in Rakhine State in Myanmar: 
I call upon all sides to work towards de-escalation and protect the civilian population. 
The high number of refugees, well over 200,000 according to the information we have, is putting great pressure on the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. 
To this end, the Federal Government supports the recently published recommendations by the Rakhine Advisory Commission headed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which provide a good starting point. 
Since then, the violence has escalated. 
On 27 August, the offices of all international (aid) organisations in northern Rakhine were closed and their staff evacuated with the assistance of the Myanmar army. 
The number of refugees registered in Bangladesh is now well over 160,000. 
I am very concerned about the most recent outbreak of fighting in Rakhine State in Myanmar which was triggered by attacks on military and police posts and has prompted another large wave of people to flee to Bangladesh. 
The priority must now be to alleviate the suffering of the people affected. 
The Myanmar Government therefore needs to allow aid agencies and humanitarian organisations unrestricted access to the affected areas. 
I welcome the fact that the Myanmar Government, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have agreed that the ICRC will be responsible for ensuring the provision of humanitarian assistance in the next two weeks. 
Over the past few days we actively lobbied the Myanmar Government on this issue. 
We expressly welcome the generosity shown by Bangladesh in taking in and providing care for the refugees. 
We’re moving toward what looks like a huge new arms race. 
Who is this peace researcher? 
He’s an American. 
by the man who at the time was President of the United States. 
Of course, Brandt said, Germany must ensure “military protection”. 
The lesson we must learn from this is that our assessment of the current situation must not prevent us from seeing what is actually needed for people to live together in peace. 
We are currently straying from the path we originally embarked on at the end of the Cold War. 
Wherever you look, there’s talk of rearmament: in China, in India, in the Pacific, in America, in parts of Africa and in Europe. 
What we are currently witnessing in North Korea shows how dangerous the world could become for our children – and for us as well, in a few years, when countries begin to acquire nuclear weapons. 
How, I ask, would the so-called balance of terror work if nuclear weapons were to spread to many countries in the world – and who would such a balance be between? 
Not only that – 
He argues that, if we want to prevent many small countries from acquiring these arms, then the major powers that possess them today must actually begin to disarm. Otherwise their actions would no longer be credible. 
However, we must also work to ensure that consensus on current disarmament and arms control treaties, especially in the nuclear domain, is not further undermined – because according to Kissinger the world is moving in the wrong direction. 
Russia is expanding its non-strategic nuclear arsenal in Europe and is suspected of violating the INF Treaty that was concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty bans an entire category of weapons, namely intermediate-range land-based missiles. It’s a cornerstone of European security, 
something we still benefit from today. 
in Europe, we’ve lost the progress we’ve made on controlling conventional weapons. 
All States Parties made a commitment to declare their military assets and also agreed to permit inspections. 
They were created for when there’s a lack of mutual trust. 
Human Rights Commissioner on the arrest of the Palestinian human rights defender Issa Amro 
“I am very concerned about the arrest of Issa Amro by the Palestinian security services. 
Among other things, he is accused of posing a threat to public order. 
I am sure the money we spend today on the military and military equipment could be used for much more than funding health programmes. 
To date, no solid legal grounds have been put forward which could justify the arrest. 
Mr Amro should therefore be released from prison immediately.” 
The right to freedom of opinion is anchored in the Palestinian Basic Law. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (8 September) on the arrest of the Palestinian human rights activist Issa Amro: 
It is generally assumed that he was arrested because of comments he made on social media criticising the Government. 
He may have been arrested in reaction to a comment he posted on Facebook criticising the arrest of a radio journalist. 
Germany, too, is involved in humanitarian assistance for those affected in Bangladesh through the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). 
The renewed crisis in Rakhine shows how important it is to improve the situation in the state in the long term. 
I appeal to Aung San Suu Kyi and the Government of Myanmar to implement the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission immediately and thoroughly. 
Independent observers were not permitted to enter the area of operations. Only on 6 September did the Myanmar Government allow access to a group of 21 journalists. 
Because they possess more than 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons, Russia and the United States still have a special responsibility to reduce their nuclear arsenals and thereby begin a new era of détente. 
The first step is to build confidence. This will only happen if we revitalise our arms control mechanisms. 
Every year, he explains, billions of dollars are spent on weapons that are “acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them”. 
But it must be said that this is a quote from a speech delivered in 1963 – 
Just imagine if today we had a US President who would make this same statement and work toward this goal. 
If we want to seize on the ideas of Kennedy and Brandt and use them in our present-day situation, I think the first step must be to do a stocktaking – as Brandt put it, “without any illusions”. 
Instead of peaceful coexistence, we run the risk of entering a new arms race – one that is set to take place not only between Russia and NATO, but on a global scale. 
If North Korea actually attains the objectives it’s pursuing with its aggressive nuclear programme, this will get other countries thinking. That could be especially, but not only, true in the region, which is why no one should be more interested than China in preventing nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Other countries will begin to think about whether their own regime may be better defended and regional conflicts better managed, or bent to their will, if they acquire nuclear weapons. 
I recently hosted members of the so-called Deep Cuts Commission. 
Because NATO and the United States, too, are these days considering whether they should shelve it. 
Later, however, we failed to obtain ratification of an adapted CFE Treaty, and Russia suspended implementation of the Treaty in 2007. 
Next week, a major exercise will be held in Russia and in Belarus. It may be one of the largest since the end of the Cold War. 
I believe that, first of all, we must speak out in favour of charting a new course, one that doesn’t simply follow the current mainstream. 
Most importantly, we need a debate on this issue. 
Kennedy and Brandt and those who followed in their footsteps had the unenviable task of guiding us through the Cold War, under the constant threat of nuclear escalation. 
When I take the floor at a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers and say that we should actually be discussing disarmament and arms control, as well, I almost feel like I’m rocking the boat. 
My general impression right now is that Ministers are not guided by the political principle that we need both – deterrence as well as efforts toward arms control and disarmament – and that both should be equally important for determining political action. 
There was only one item on the agenda: disarmament. 
These days, it’s hard to imagine what that was like. 
Here in Germany, we’ve had far more controversial public debates. Everyone who experienced the debate – and demonstrations – surrounding the NATO Double-Track Decision knows what I’m talking about! 
I think that today, as well, we need an intensive and much more critical public debate on the issue of disarmament. It is, after all, again a matter of war and peace. 
But we are talking far too little about opportunities for confidence-building measures, disarmament initiatives, joint arms control efforts and building trust. 
I have the impression that we sometimes pursue an orthodox policy of rearmament without giving thought to what will secure a peaceful international order in the long term. 
Of course, in the difficult current situation, and considering that not only European security is under threat, we cannot simply say 
We therefore absolutely say that, yes, we must maintain our defences, for the protection of our European friends, our partners in NATO. 
We also are worried about the fact that, since suspension of implementation of the CFE Treaty, Russia and NATO are no longer having to comply with any strict arms control rules. 
It is why Frank-Walter Steinmeier, my predecessor as Foreign Minister and our country’s current Federal President, has proposed that we embark on new paths toward conventional arms control. 
We intend to take up again and pursue this initiative. 
Incidentally, throughout Europe and in this country, we are talking a lot about the current crisis in Ukraine. It was triggered by what we view as Russia’s illegal operation in Crimea, and this of course means we are now more or less in a phase marked by confrontation. 
Yesterday, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin made a proposal that Germany has been asking him to make for quite some time, because we know that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission is unarmed and its monitors are constantly in danger when out on patrol and performing inspections, also at night. 
We know that ceasefire violations are occurring on both sides. 
Its mission would be not to replace, but rather to accompany and protect. It would be a parallel institution to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, for the purpose of monitoring the ceasefire. 
Yesterday, the Russian President announced his proposal and declared that he has instructed his Foreign Minister to draw up initial ideas on how such a UN peacekeeping mission could be employed in eastern Ukraine. 
Yet it would be remiss not to welcome this public announcement by the Russian President. It marks a true departure from his previous position. We should welcome the proposal and say we’re happy that this initiative is now moving forward. 
If we want to stop the spread of war, civil war, fundamentalism, Islamism and migration flows, this will ultimately not be possible without fighting hunger and poverty, as well as hardship and suffering, or without building hope and prospects for the future in the affected countries. 
That is why we are proposing that, for every euro Germany spends on better equipment for the Bundeswehr – and it certainly does need equipment, that’s different from rearmament – at least an additional 1.5 euros be invested in crisis prevention, stabilisation and economic cooperation. 
What is more, by signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 2014, President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority entered into an obligation to protect this right. 
Issa Amro, who is recognised by the European Union and the United Nations as a human rights defender and is founder and coordinator of Youth Against Settlements, was arrested by Palestinian security forces on 4 September 2017. 
Mr Amro began a hunger strike on 5 September 2017 in protest against his detention. 
We must always pursue the peaceful resolution of conflicts. However, like Willy Brandt said, we must do so from a militarily protected position. 
I also think that, subsequently, Europe should make an offer, namely by volunteering to assist reconstruction efforts in eastern Ukraine. 
My fear is that currently the United States is focussed on new sanctions against Russia, and that this could intensify the nationalistic rhetoric of election campaigns in Russia. That, in turn, would generate momentum away from, rather than toward, détente. 
These days, I suspect this funding could be secured with not even half a day’s, but maybe only half an hour’s, military expenditure. 
In that political climate, an American President spoke about a “strategy of peace”. 
he says that Global Zero is the right objective. 
Yes, Western countries also conduct exercises. 
I see people talking only about rearmament. 
This holds true not only for NATO, but also for many countries, including Russia, China and India. 
Today, we can be grateful for one thing: we currently have a greater and more broad public debate about foreign policy than we did a few years ago. 
Right now, we’re only discussing military protection against threats. 
We must do everything within our power to maintain and jointly develop them – and, if necessary, to dare to embark on a new path, for example, toward conventional arms control. 
This means, on the one hand, making sure that existing arms control and disarmament mechanisms, such as the Treaty on Open Skies, the Vienna Document and the Chemical Weapons Convention are maintained, also by pressing for their faithful implementation. 
We will be pressing for a joint effort to revisit the methods and aims of conventional arms control in Europe, and to achieve concrete results in this sphere. 
that it will go along with this only if negotiations on a political process begin at the same time. 
it has long been clear that our arms control mechanisms, even if they were still functioning properly, are somewhat outdated and eroded. They’ve fallen behind developments in technology and logistics, for example regarding the current deployability of troops and military assets. 
We want arms control agreements in place that create transparency, trust and, ultimately, equilibrium – but at low levels, not leaving us armed to the teeth like during the Cold War. 
As I mentioned earlier, after his Chancellorship Willy Brandt served as Chairman of an international board, the Brandt Commission on the North-South Divide. 
In Germany, too, there is currently a debate that’s not in any way tied to military policy aims, but is rather simply campaigning for certain military spending targets. 
If these were implemented, it would lead to a doubling of our country’s military budget. 
According to the targets that the United States President would like us to meet, our country would spend 70 billion euros on military equipment. 
This is also about how we – the countries of the world – approach these challenges. It’s about joint action and a collaborative effort. 
When taking a level-headed look at the security situation, I believe we will come to a rather depressing conclusion: 
The most important reason is, however, that these two people, along with many others – at a time when hardly anyone believed in de-escalation or in a world with fewer weapons, and when things were moving in the opposite direction – focused their political efforts on the idea of disarmament and arms control. 
The Community of Sant’Egidio is an important partner for us as regards promoting de-escalation and understanding worldwide via religion.” 
The Federal Foreign Office supports this organisation’s global endeavours to foster peace, particularly in the fields of mediation and reconciliation processes. 
Interview with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the situation in Turkey and the issue of refugees. 
I have a question about the televised debate: 
Martin Schulz surprisingly spoke out in favour of ending EU accession negotiations with Turkey. 
Of course, we’ve had discussions on this issue for quite some time now, but Martin Schulz as the candidate for the chancellorship naturally has the final say. 
I completely agree with him. 
Endeavours in this field form part of Germany’s cultural relations and education policy. 
I do think, by the way, and almost all Germans share this view, that Turkey in its present situation will never become a member of the EU. 
Further information is available at 
Martin Schulz only said what the man and woman on the street are thinking. 
Germany should have an interest in good relations with Turkey, if only because of the many Germans with Turkish roots. 
They still have many ties to Turkey. 
Yes, that’s a great thing. Those ties should remain in place. 
High-level religious officials and politicians from all over the world are meeting in Münster and Osnabrück from 10 to 12 September at the Paths of Peace convention hosted by the Catholic lay organisation, Community of Sant’Egidio. 
And, in that regard, Turkey is becoming an authoritarian regime. 
You, as Foreign Minister, or the party’s candidate for the chancellorship? 
Foreign Minister Gabriel: foreign policy should make greater use of religions’ peacemaking potential 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin today (9 September) on the occasion of the Paths of Peace meeting hosted by the Catholic lay organisation, Community of Sant’Egidio, in Münster and Osnabrück: 
“Religions have enormous potential to foster peace in societies. 
They have a profound knowledge of guilt, forgiveness and reconciliation, as well as the capacity to bring about equity and justice in societies. 
In view of the many conflicts around the world, we would like to make greater use of this peacemaking potential than we have done so far. 
The aim is to discuss the various religions’ potential to foster peace in society in their regions and to link this potential more closely with German foreign policy. 
The long-term goal is to work with different faiths and faith-based organisations with shared interests such as peace and stability as strategic partners in a sustainable network. 
Turkish women and men and their children in Germany enjoy living here precisely because it is different. 
How am I supposed to explain to people that we are conducting EU accession negotiations with a government that is currently establishing the exact opposite at home? 
But by making such negative statements about Turkey you’re actually escalating tensions... 
You’re distorting the facts. 
A few months ago, Mr Erdogan called us “Nazi Germany”. 
Despite this, we remained silent for months. 
He is still arresting German citizens and has placed more than 600 German companies under suspicion of maintaining ties to terrorists. 
Should our response then be to say 
“That’s okay, it’s water under the bridge, let’s forget about it”? 
Ten Germans are currently being detained in Turkey for political reasons. 
What precisely are you doing to obtain their release? 
First, we are trying to get consular access to these individuals, so that we can help them. Doing so is not easy, because we face illegal obstruction from the Turkish authorities. 
Turkey is actually obligated to grant us this access immediately. 
Second, we are using all of the diplomatic and political means at our disposal, including bringing our case before the European Court of Human Rights. 
Third, I have spoken with the Turkish President about this in Ankara. 
Do you think that people actually read it? 
Thankfully, the media have frequently mentioned the travel advice in their reports, and this has drawn people’s attention to them. 
We’re massively increasing economic pressure on Turkey. 
That’s the most effective way to get Turkey to think about its actions. 
Should German companies also scale down their activities in Turkey? 
Because Turkey’s authorities have said that more than 600 German companies are suspected of supporting terrorism – ranging from Daimler to BASF to small enterprises – our advice to companies is: 
As you just said, 
Erdogan has called on the approximately three million Germans with Turkish roots to not vote for either the CDU or the SPD. 
What is your response to that? 
This is an unprecedented and reprehensible act. 
But you are right in saying that 
What are you doing to support the civilian population in Turkey? 
We are increasing funding for our scholarship programmes. 
Through the Philipp Schwartz Initiative, we have given persecuted researchers the opportunity to come live and work here in Germany. 
We’re doing what we can to strengthen our ties particularly with those individuals who are not toeing Erdogan’s line. 
Do you know how Deniz Yücel is doing? 
I think a situation like this is hard for anyone to bear. 
Being incarcerated is difficult enough for an individual. 
I can only deeply admire Mr Yücel’s strength and resilience, given the situation. 
What would your reaction be if Erdogan were to actually reinstate the death penalty? 
Let me switch topics, to Africa and the issue of refugees. 
Africa’s population is growing very fast. Climate change is destroying livelihoods in entire regions there. 
Why is Germany doing so little to keep this from happening? 
We have quadrupled our funding for crisis prevention. 
We’ve expanded our funding for sustainable development cooperation and economic assistance significantly, much more than in any previous legislative term. 
We’re a lot more strongly engaged than others. 
The European Union must urgently change its policy toward Africa. 
Africa must not only be seen as a continent faced with a host of problems. 
Many African countries are developing very well. 
Hardly any Arab country has brought forth as many Islamist terrorists as Tunisia. 
Most terrorists in Europe grew up here, too, or became radicalised here. 
That’s why – in addition to strengthening our police force and judiciary, which is necessary – we must make a much greater effort to prevent radicalisation. 
Let me ask you again, 
how can Germany stabilise African countries? 
All soldiers who return from serving in a mission tell us that 
We must fight hunger and poverty instead. 
Recently, far fewer African refugees have been crossing the Mediterranean from Libya to Europe. 
Is that the right solution to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean? 
And the refugees are truly suffering, some most cruelly. 
In any case, turning a blind eye and doing nothing would be disastrous. 
We Europeans must do two things. 
First, we must act as one in Libya. 
If today the French show up and tomorrow the Italians make an appearance, followed by someone else, then the parties to the civil war will always try to hide behind one of these partners. 
Second, Europe must not leave Italy in the lurch. 
We are taking in too few refugees from Italy. 
Hungary is refusing to accept refugees, despite the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. 
Will you accept that? 
Anyone who questions this ruling is attacking the very heart of the European Union. 
Florian Harms. 
Who determines the SPD’s policy on Turkey? 
Does the German Government need a stronger response? 
Because here there’s freedom of expression, freedom of religion and democracy. 
But they live in Germany – and I’m glad they’re here. 
We aren’t looking to break off diplomatic relations with Turkey. 
We should be truly grateful to these people with Turkish roots, because they helped build up our country. 
This is about the European Union. 
But getting it always requires a hard fight. 
But the outcome of all this was simply that even more people were arrested. 
However, doing business in Turkey these days does bear risks. 
President Erdogan doesn’t want this to happen, anyway. He told me so a few years ago already. 
His Ministers have labelled German Ministers “racists”. 
Mr Erdogan is calling on voters in Germany to not cast their ballots for the democratic parties. 
We have used all available channels to discuss the issue with them, including confidential, public and semi-public channels, as well as mediators. 
“think long and hard before you do business there”. We are not calling on anyone to backtrack on an investment project, that’s a free entrepreneurial decision. 
Just imagine if the German Government were to call on Turks not to vote for Mr Erdogan’s party. 
The Turkish Government is using last summer’s coup as an excuse to take systematic action against both its critics and the civilian population. 
The coup was of course a reprehensible attempt to sweep aside democracy in Turkey. It can in no way be justified. 
Erdogan is now using it to go after his political opponents. 
In Germany, we are providing protection for academics, journalists and artists. 
He is as well as can be expected, given the circumstances. 
But if you are being held in prison despite being innocent and have no idea when charges will be filed against you, if you do not know what legal procedure you will be subjected to and are completely at the mercy of authorities that give you no information whatsoever – I imagine he must be under tremendous pressure. 
That would once and for all sever Turkey’s ties with Europe. 
But it’s an illusion to think that Germany can stop this development on its own. 
Our problem is that we justifiably pay a lot of attention to those terrorists who enter Germany from abroad, 
but we pay far too little attention to those individuals who come here peacefully and later become radicalised in our country. 
This should even extend to closing radical mosques. 
We must not cave in to the belief of Mr Trump – like Ms Merkel is unfortunately doing right now – that, by increasing military spending, we will create more security. 
“Yes, the military is sometimes needed, as well. But don’t think that, by using the military, we will create more stability and peace.” 
We need to support sustainable development and build infrastructure. That’s where the truly large potential lies. 
Let me add that, in so doing, we also create export markets for European goods and services. 
The failed state of Libya is currently a large problem. 
They bring these people back to the camps, where they are brutally mistreated. 
In Libya, we are faced with the dilemma of standing by and watching what’s going on or working together with the actors on the ground as well as we can, to help alleviate the refugees’ suffering. 
These camps are bad enough when they are being controlled by state authorities, I’ve visited them and seen so myself. 
The camps run by militias are much worse. Some refugees are tortured, raped or even murdered there. 
That’s why Emmanuel Macron’s initiative to bring together General Haftar and Prime Minister al-Sarraj is an important step. 
That is something we must change. 
It is of course disastrous that there are EU countries that are calling into question the applicability of European law. 
All EU member states must accept it. 
Your Ministry has tightened the travel advice for Turkey. 
Think of the uproar! 
We receive regular updates on his condition, because we do have consular access to him. 
According to an estimate of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, up to 100 million people could try to migrate to Europe. 
We have a problem in France, in Belgium and here in Germany, with so-called home-grown terrorists. 
They are being stopped by the so-called Libyan coast guard, which in truth is run by warlords. 
In its Responsibility of the Religions for Peace initiative, the Federal Foreign Office is conducting a close and organised dialogue with representatives of different faiths from a large number of countries and regions. 
The first event was a conference in Berlin from 21 to 23 May attended by over 100 representatives of religions from 53 countries. 
How can someone guide Turkey to EU membership who has thrown overboard everything that defines Europe, including the freedom of expression, human rights and the rule of law? 
Is it very wise to write off Turkey? 
German Government sends crisis support team to region hit by Hurricane Irma 
A spokesperson for the Federal Foreign Office issued the following statement today (12 September): 
It has caused tremendous damage, especially on some Caribbean islands. 
The number of staff at the Consulate General in Atlanta has been increased. 
Requests for assistance can be made to the German Embassy in Washington, DC, by calling +1-202-298-4000. 
German citizens have been affected in the Caribbean, as well. 
Some of these are on Sint Maarten/Saint Martin. 
They will be evacuated over the next two days. 
At the same time, a Bundeswehr A400M cargo plane has taken off for Curaçao, where it will deliver aid supplies. 
During the past few days, Hurricane Irma has raged across the Caribbean and the south-eastern United States. It is now making its way inland, to the north-west. 
The German Government is making every possible effort to get an overview of the situation of German citizens in those areas. 
The team has 31 members and is comprised of civilian and military staff from the Federal Foreign Office, the German Bundeswehr, the Federal Agency for Technical Relief and the Crisis Intervention Team. 
Our Government is ready to provide emergency assistance to people in the region and to help them repair the damage. 
We have taken the following steps to enable quick reaction with a minimum of red tape: 
A regional crisis centre has been set up in Atlanta to coordinate assistance. 
A crisis support team arrived in the United States early on 12 September. 
Up to 200,000 German citizens are currently in Florida, and others are in the Caribbean islands. 
Last night, a crisis support team arrived in the United States to assist German and European victims of Hurricane Irma. 
Up to 200,000 German citizens are currently in Florida and in the Caribbean islands. 
That is why the Crisis Response Centre at the Federal Foreign Office has been working around the clock since Saturday. 
Experts of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief take special equipment with them wherever they go. 
The German agency’s staff are experts at coordinating the logistics of aid activities following such disasters. 
The German Air Force has sent a cargo plane to the Caribbean.

Evacuation of Sint Maarten/Saint Martin 
The Crisis Response Centre at the Federal Foreign Office works around the clock providing assistance. 
Moreover, a crisis support team comprised of staff from the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Agency for Technical Relief, the German Bundeswehr and members of professional fire brigades arrived in the US in the early hours of Tuesday (12 September). 
The team is in the US to assist German and European citizens who have been severely affected by the hurricane. 
A regional crisis centre has been set up in Atlanta to coordinate the efforts. 
Ready to help: experts of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief 
Arraiolos Group meeting of non-executive EU Presidents in Malta 
On 14 and 15 September, Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in Malta for this year’s Arraiolos Group meeting of non-executive EU Presidents. 
This is the thirteenth meeting of the Arraiolos Group. 
A Bundeswehr A400M cargo plane has also taken off for Curaçao, where it will deliver aid supplies and help German citizens in the Caribbean who have been affected by Hurricane Irma. 
The evacuation of German citizens from Sint Maarten/Saint Martin is being organised over the next two days. 
German Presidency of the Convention on Cluster Munitions 
Making Conventional Arms Control Fit for the 21st Century 
These words were spoken by John F. Kennedy. 
By the way, John F. Kennedy delivered this speech at a time when confrontation between the former Soviet Union and the United States was heating up, not cooling down. 
Willy Brandt, who at the time of Kennedy’s speech was mayor of West Berlin, seized on the ideas of John F. Kennedy and developed a peace policy for Germany – the foundation of which remains in place to this day. 
One reason to remember Brandt is that, forty years ago, almost to the day, he became Chairman of the Brandt Commission on the North-South Divide, which looked at ways that the world’s poor and wealthy could live together better. Incidentally, the Commission also predicted there would be refugee flows and dealt with the issues of armament and arms control. 
Willy Brandt clearly finalised his policy of détente in 1968, the same year that Warsaw Pact forces marched into Prague. 
Proven disarmament mechanisms are coming under strain, and trust is being lost that is needed for cooperation. 
If this were to happen, the world would become a more dangerous place than it ever was during the difficult times of the East-West confrontation. 
I think this is why the idea that is so firmly rooted in international political strategy, namely that we need a balance of terror, merely reflects the situation during the second half of the 20th century – and can’t be applied to what we may face during the first half of the 21st century. 
That is why seasoned politicians like Henry Kissinger, who truly cannot be considered one of the world’s peaceniks, is so decisively campaigning for an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
In Germany, two years before German reunification, before the fall of the Iron Curtain, the agreements that were reached between Gorbachev and Reagan brought us a peace dividend. To this very day, we benefit from the ban on land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. 
Let me give you two examples that illustrate how much strain conventional arms control mechanisms are under today. 
Why can large exercises like this one not be notified in line with the current rules? That way, they could be comprehensively monitored, transparency would be maintained, and possible fears wouldn’t even arise in the first place. 
However, NATO and Allied countries adhere strictly to the Vienna Document and comply with their respective commitments in both letter and spirit, through timely notification and by inviting outside observers. 
What can we do, given this state of affairs? 
When one builds a measure of confidence in times of mistrust, if not through disarmament, then at least through arms control mechanisms. 
More than 3,000 journalists from the US had travelled to the meeting, to report live on the American evening news about the outcome of disarmament negotiations in this small white house in Iceland between the leaders of the world’s two superpowers. 
But I do think that the discussion, which should be focussing on both disarmament and arms control, is lopsided. 
So what we need is an architecture for arms control and disarmament that has been made fit for the 21st century – not geopolitical strategies from the 20th century. 
Now we all know this gives rise to what seems like a thousand questions, including: What should Blue Helmets do? What will they be responsible for? What are the various interests of the parties to the conflict? 
So now let’s talk about the various ideas that are on the table. Let’s focus on beginning dynamic negotiations with the aim of getting some results – results that will truly help all sides, Ukraine and Russia, as well as the Donbass, to actually achieve a lasting ceasefire. 
It would not be wise for us to turn down this proposal out of hand, by alleging there must be a malign plan behind what Russia is saying, so we don’t even want to talk to them about it. 
The entire Federal Budget amounts to only 300 billion euros. Even France – which is a nuclear power, after all – spends “only” 40 billion on its military equipment. 
The year of Germany’s Presidency of the Convention on Cluster Munitions came to a successful conclusion on 6 September. 
The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions and currently has 101 States Parties. 
Defused device 
The goal of the German Presidency was to advance the scope and implementation of the Convention in order to increase its humanitarian impact. 
“We must see Europe as a team game” 
Europe isn’t out of the woods yet by a long stretch. 
Some things have improved. The number of unemployed people has gone down overall, for example. 
We must devote ourselves creatively and vigorously to the EU in order for it to remain our life insurance against crises. 
It is also important to us for our neighbouring country to return to greater economic and social stability. 
Rapid assistance for victims of Hurricane Irma 
Hurricane Irma caused great devestation as it raged across the Caribbean and the south‑eastern United States. 
Last week, the Federal Foreign Office already set up a crisis unit. 
The task of the seconded crisis support team is to help the Consulate General in Atlanta rapidly assist German citizens affected by the hurricane in consular matters. 
The seconded experts of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief are also ready to support US Government authorities in their disaster response efforts. 
The same staff most recently helped in the US in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
At that time, high‑capacity pumps of the German agency drew more than five million cubic metres of flood water out of New Orleans. 
What’s your suggestion? 
Global framework 
Germany’s further commitment

Initiatives during the Presidency 
During the German Presidency, progress was made on two concrete initiatives. 
Even after handing over the Presidency to Nicaragua, Germany will continue to work to promote the Convention and support the Presidency as a member of the Coordination Committee. 
Will it now be easier to achieve these objectives thanks to Brexit? 
Nothing will be easier. 
But perhaps the Brexit negotiations will now show everyone that nothing gets better when you withdraw from the EU. 
The Presidency was dominated by a renewed increase in the number of victims as a result of the use of cluster munitions. 
Not all EU member states are on the same page as far as democracy is concerned, however. 
This situation once again shows the necessity of driving forward the global prohibition of cluster munitions. 
We just need to take a look at the EU treaties, 
Through its Presidency, Germany contributed to this goal. 
No further use of cluster munitions was recorded in 2017. 
It is also infinitely more difficult to measure whether and to what extent the rule of law is being restricted or weakened. 
One outcome of the talks was the desire for a specific exchange of views between representatives of the armed forces. 
Do you sometimes want to see stronger sanctions against Poland and Hungary? 
Sanctions are not necessarily the way forward at the end of the day. 
The second initiative helped draft a concept for improving implementation of the obligations set down in the Convention. 
That’s not how things work. 
Relying on nationalists and populists will get you nowhere. 
Increasing numbers of people are coming to realise this. 
The EU must speak with one voice. 
Having said that, Germany has a particular responsibility. 
However, nothing is gained from breaking off all our contacts and tearing down all our bridges. 
Turkey is a deeply divided country. 
Erdogan didn’t win a majority for his constitutional referendum in either Istanbul or Izmir. 
The majority of young people in Turkey are on the side of democracy and European values. 
We must also bear them in mind. 
States Parties required assistance in implementing their obligations with regard to the destruction of stockpiles, clearance and victim support. 
Germany’s voice is becoming ever more important within the EU. 
Will it carry even more weight after Brexit? 
Neither. 
Germany is needed above all as a bridge-builder. 
Germany has always considered itself to be a guardian of the interests of small EU member states. 
We’re reporting from the beach in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, 
a country that was regarded for decades as a prime example of a failed state, 
but is now slowly finding its way back to stability and development. 
governance and security. 
However, Germany is not only active through its embassy, 
but also through international organisations, NGOs and the United Nations. 
A new theory holds that 
Germany and France will whip the EU into shape once President Emmanuel Macron has finished reforming France. 
This year, the Presidents of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia will be focusing on two themes: "Reclaiming Social Europe" and "Managing Security Challenges in the Euro-Mediterranean Area". 
The first of these informal meetings was held in 2003 in the Portuguese town of Arraiolos, which gave the format its name. 
of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia, Christoph Buik. 
in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia. 
That is absurd! 
Europeans are suffering as a result of excessive social and economic imbalances. 
Following the dictatorship under Siad Barre and 21 years of civil war, 
If the eurozone were to cooperate more intensively and reliably in social and economic terms, then we would be more independent from financial markets. 
The UK was an obstacle to many of the points you mentioned. 
The British people themselves will have to pay a high price for leaving the European Union. 
What can be done about this? 
which spell out what the European Union is. 
It is not simply a single market, but a community of shared values, albeit one without a homogeneous vision of society. 
Europe is open to various ethnicities, religions and cultures. 
This is badly needed, 
as we would otherwise lose credibility. 
You have to rely on the strength of a good argument in a team such as the EU. 
It is difficult to enforce the EU’s values within the Union. 
It is even more difficult to enforce them vis-à-vis Turkey. 
We must not let ourselves be divided. 
but to no avail. 
The Federal Foreign Office is supporting this process through projects in the fields of peacekeeping, 
Are you worried or pleased about this development? 
and serve here as Police Commissioner 
I continue to see major, also emotional, differences between Eastern Europe and the south. 
Our role is to establish a federal police force here in Somalia. 
We must take advantage of President Macron’s courage and overhaul the economic and monetary union. 
So I hope that the EU develops a dynamic in which, at long last, it learns from the mistakes of the past. 
A heated debate is currently under way in Europe on this matter in the course of which we must fight for the values of the Union. 
It’s easier to identify and impose sanctions on countries saddled with excessive debt by using economic and fiscal indicators than to call countries violating the principles of democracy to task. 
Politicians cannot constantly attempt to discredit the EU while having almost all of their public investments financed out of the EU budget at the same time. 
We have tried for years to speak the language of diplomacy, 
We mustn’t constantly throw our economic weight around and must see Europe as a team game in which everyone has a role to play, no matter their country’s size. 
Mr Gabriel, is the Bundeswehr able to fulfil its duties on deployments abroad? 
But that’s only part of the story. 
We Europeans, not just us Germans, also need to do more on the civilian side in crisis-hit countries. 
That’s where we in the Social Democratic Party disagree with the CDU: they, unlike us, want to double the armaments budget. 
We think that’s the wrong thing to do, since we are not going to solve these crises by military means alone. 
In Europe, we spend half as much on defence as the United States. 
It is wrong to think that ever more defence expenditure will mean ever greater security. 
but equipment provision is not the same as rearmament. 
The first question that needs answering is, “Who will provide security?” 
We Europeans therefore have to act together and do what we can so that the legitimate government is strengthened and lasting peace is established in Libya. 
The displaced-persons camps are controlled in part by criminal gangs. 
But we mustn’t give in to the illusion that the military alone could pacify the situation. 
What danger does North Korea represent? 
If what North Korea is doing brings it success, the danger is that others may follow and neighbouring countries will acquire nuclear weapons. 
That would lead us straight into an arms race and make the world an even more dangerous place. 
In the case of non‑States Parties, this involved launching a process of exchange to identify steps that could lead to accession. 
In Yemen, for example, joint intervention has succeeded in halting the deployment of these weapons. 
To enter into exchange with non‑States Parties, structured consultations were established. 
The most important issues in this context were views on the role of the Convention and the willingness to engage in regular exchange as well as the possibility to take interim steps such as halting the production, export and use of cluster munitions. 
The Country Coalition Concept is a practical approach designed to ensure the successful coordination and country‑specific adaptation of the necessary measures with the help of a tandem consisting of the State Party concerned and a donor. 
Two regional seminars, one for South‑East Asia and one for South‑East Europe, were held to put the idea to an initial practical test and to promote the concept. 
A particular priority will be to continue discussions with non‑States Parties. 
There are only three countries that can effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and they are 
Russia, China and the United States. 
We have to make sure North Korea’s tactics don’t inspire copycats. 
Germany has to be an advocate for peace in that debate, not double our defence spending. 
That is Germany’s role. 
I don’t even know where that money would be supposed to come from. 
Surely it would be a better thing to double education spending. 
What can you do for the Germans being held in Turkey? 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth in an interview with the “Frankfurter Rundschau” on 13 September 2017. Issues discussed: 
dealing with right‑wing populism, Franco‑German relations, Brexit, Poland and Hungary’s stance within the EU, and Turkey. 
Mr Roth, are right‑wing populists no longer a threat in Europe? 
After numerous election defeats such as in France and the Netherlands, hardly anyone is talking about this issue at any rate, even though right‑wing parties are in government in a number of countries. 
We shouldn’t, however, allow ourselves to be taken in by the CDU’s unambitious EU policy of just muddling through. 
We would be well advised to seize the outstretched hand of this pro‑European French President. 
However, in order for this to happen, we have to know what shape our cooperation with France ought to take. 
And yet the Federal Chancellor is refusing to be drawn on this issue before 24 September. 
One reason for Brussel’s tough line of negotiation is to discipline the EU member states. 
And so I am grateful to the European Commission for raising this issue resolutely time and again. 
Increasing numbers of countries are being sensitised to this also within the Council of Ministers. 
How much tougher would you like talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be? 
We maintain close relations with Turkey, not least because three million people with Turkish roots live here and enrich our lives. 
Germany make a particular effort, however. 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is using Germany as an external enemy, to obscure his internal contradictions. 
But with Germans being unjustly detained in Turkey and with the Turkish Government putting 680 German companies on a terrorism black list, we had to do something. 
A special role is played by the head of the Police Section 
I have been here for two years now on secondment from the German police 
we are trying to bring about a significant improvement in stabilisation in Somalia 
and to implement reliable security structures in the country 
through this police structure. 
Ankara reacted to that pretty quickly. 
That economic pressure has had an effect. 
We all fare better with the European Union. 
In Germany, too, we need a new Federal Government that wants to develop Europe further with courage and confidence. 
There are many good suggestions on developing the European Union further. 
more integration, more solidarity, more freedom, more justice, more democracy and more rule of law. 
We absolutely cannot allow the European Union to be split into East and West, North and South, and rich and poor. 
Only together are we strong and able to assert our values and interests in the world. 
That is a task for us all, including us Germans. 
We, too, must be willing to compromise, to think of Europe as a whole and to invest even more in the common European project. 
Now is the time to set the course for a good future for Europe. 
always looking ahead, being a pioneer of the European idea and never giving up in the search for ideas and suggestions on how we can foster our shared Europe, make it more resilient to crises and enhance it as a player with a global role. 
In Emmanuel Macron, a dedicated reformer is leading France. 
Europe is a community with a shared destiny and values. 
The EU will only be a strong player internationally with a voice that is heard in the world if we succeed in strengthening its internal cohesion once again. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel talks to the Nordwest-Zeitung newspaper about Bundeswehr deployments abroad, the situation facing the displaced in Libya, nuclear conflict with North Korea and the Germans being detained in Turkey (interview published on 13 September 2017). 
“Wherever possible, far-sighted policies must ensure that crises do not break out in the first place. 
After a ceasefire, a peace dividend must be achieved quickly. This dividend must reach the people in the crisis-hit areas and create faith in political progress beyond the zero-sum game of violence.” 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the speech by European Commission President Juncker 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (13 September) after the speech by the President of the European Commission, Jean‑Claude Juncker: 
“I welcome the passionate and pioneering speech by Jean‑Claude Juncker. 
It expresses precisely what the Commission’s role in the process of European integration should be – 
We have overcome the acute crises in Europe. 
Jean‑Claude Juncker’s inspiring ideas give us a great deal of input for further discussions and debates. 
Jean‑Claude Juncker has indicated the right path for the cohesion of our continent – 
This conviction constitutes a further curtailment of the rights of the Crimean Tatars on the peninsula following its annexation by Russia. 
Akhtem Chiygoz was a strong proponent of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
This violates all rule-of-law principles, in particular the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which Russia, too, has ratified. 
The rights of the Tatars in Crimea must be restored without delay and international human rights standards respected in full. 
The International Court of Justice has expressly called on Russia to do so. 
The Crimean Tatars have been prime targets. 
Persecution has focused above all on the Mejlis, the executive representative body of the Crimean Tatars. 
Akhtem Chiygoz is Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis. 
Then, as I see it, there will a major risk of yet more countries wanting to acquire nuclear weapons, including African states. 
That’s a game you can’t play along with. 
The Bundeswehr is having some issues with equipment and supplies. 
We should therefore get the Bundeswehr better equipped quickly so that it can live up to its responsibilities on its deployments abroad. 
But the trouble is that our spending is considerably less effective because we still collaborate too little with one another on military matters. 
we do need a better-equipped Bundeswehr, which means we need to spend more – 
What can be done to improve the situation facing displaced persons in Libya? 
Libya is a country where state structures are insufficient. 
This is a prerequisite for greater security, which will in turn better enable us and the United Nations to do more for these people on the ground. 
What can be done, in your opinion, to calm the conflict with North Korea? 
We can look for new ways to work together with Russia and China. 
I therefore advocate breathing new life into détente efforts. 
We are approaching a new window of opportunity just now, and we should use it. 
At the moment, the lack of trust between East and West is causing us to lay waste to the arms-control bodies that cost so much laborious but successful effort to develop during the 1980s. 
For a long time, the German Government responded in a level-headed and very restrained manner to his provocations. 
We have cut our economic assistance and issued clear advice about the risks involved in investing in Turkey. 
Germany’s private sector also objected to Turkey’s actions. 
He was accused of organising mass riots and inciting unrest. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the sentencing of Akhtem Chiygoz 
I am outraged by the so-called “Supreme Court” of annexed Crimea’s sentencing of Akhtem Chiygoz, Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, to several years of imprisonment. 
It is unacceptable for people to be locked up and convicted for expressing their political opinions. 
He was not present in person at his trial proceedings, but participated only via a video teleconference link. 
Since the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Crimea, anyone on the peninsula who opposes the annexation has been subjected to systematic harassment. 
He was arrested in January 2015 for participating in a rally in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine in front of the Supreme Council building of Crimea on 26 February 2014. Since his arrest, he has been in pretrial detention in Simferopol, Crimea. 
On 11 September 2017, the “Supreme Court of Crimea” sentenced him to eight years in prison. 
On 26 April 2016, in response to an application filed by the “Prosecutor-General of Crimea”, the “Supreme Court of Crimea” classified the Mejlis an extremist organisation and outlawed its activities. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (13 September) on the sentencing of Akhtem Chiygoz, Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis, the executive representative body of the Crimean Tartar people.

Innovative methods and strategies in peace processes were the focus of this year’s Global Peacebuilder Summit. 
Meeting for peace 
Holding discussions: participant from northern Kenya Fatuma Abdulkadir The Global Peacebuilder Summit, promoted by the Federal Foreign Office, took place for the second time. 
Twenty-eight representatives from civil society organisations held discussions on their peacebuilding efforts in Paretz near Potsdam last week (7 to 12 September). 
The objective is therefore to create long-term cooperative partnerships and networks. 
On Monday (11 September), the peace activists also met employees of the Federal Foreign Office during their conference. 
Together, they identified obstacles to fostering peace and examined ways in which the Federal Foreign Office can support peacebuilders’ efforts in an even more targeted manner. 
At the end of the day, it will be necessary to expand the scope of civil societies once again in order to consolidate the peacebuilders’ work in the long term.

On the one hand, our partners respect our democratic freedoms, stability and economic success. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (14 September) on the arrest of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy by the Egyptian authorities: 
“You’re not helping us in the fight against youth unemployment and the economic crisis. 
You’re rich – you can afford to do that. 
Helmut Kohl would never have countenanced such a thing. 
One of the most important preconditions for the future of our country is for us Europeans to stick together – 
in our values and in our actions. 
“I am very concerned about the disappearance and subsequent arrest of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy by the Egyptian authorities. 
Respect for human rights and a free civil society are basic prerequisites for social harmony and lasting stability, and also the best defence against radicalisation and extremism. 
Mr Hegazy also worked on the case of the murdered Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni. 
“We know that you Germans are leading Europe economically. 
We had almost become accustomed to the fact that you’re leading the continent politically. 
I hope that Martin Schulz becomes the next Federal Chancellor so that this can change. 
He is accused of managing an illegal group, spreading false news and cooperating with foreign organisations. 
Martin Schulz only gave expression to what has long been a reality – and for which Mr Erdogan is responsible. 
Under his leadership, Turkey is rapidly leaving the path that could perhaps lead to EU accession. 
If a German politician didn’t say what 99 percent of the German people know and think, then that would be a problem. 
How do you intend to get the Germans detained in Turkey out of jail? 
For one thing, it is important that we gain consular access to them in the first place so that we know how those who have been detained are faring. 
His own son vanished in 2013 and has never been seen again. 
But even with consular access, we still don’t know how to get our German citizens released. 
Mr Hegazy disappeared from Cairo Airport on 10 September 2017 when he was on his way to Geneva, where he was to report on enforced disappearances at the invitation of the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances. 
Only two days later was it revealed that he had been arrested by the Egyptian authorities and was being interrogated. 
Just talking about the issue hasn’t brought us any closer to a solution. 
We have now made it plain to Ankara that we cannot go on like this. 
This will hopefully give the Turkish Government pause for thought and, at some point, make it act. 
It is terrible to be imprisoned as an innocent person and to be utterly at the mercy of the authorities. 
He is being held in Scorpion, the high-security wing of Tora prison. 
Each and every detainee has inviolable rights. 
Not so in Turkey, however. 
Only the problem is that 
the more often we talk about this, the more you write about this, the greater the risk that Deniz Yücel and the other Germans will be locked away for even longer. 
Have there been any developments with regard to the case of “pilgrim” David B. from Schwerin, some of whose family lives in Cologne? 
He has been detained in Turkey for almost six months – no reason for this has been disclosed. 
It comes as no surprise that some people in Europe fold their arms and tell us: 
You can deal with your Turkey problem on your own, thank you very much! 
And if you want to pile economic pressure on them, then fine! 
We can’t. 
The worst thing that I heard a European colleague say after we took in the refugees in 2015 was this: 
And people are being arrested out of the blue, apparently even on the strength of denunciations and, at any rate, without telling those affected what they are being charged with. 
I imagine that the mere uncertainty must be incredibly difficult to bear. 
You’ll forgive me for saying 
But now you also want to lead us morally as well?” This is a consequence of the schoolmaster attitude that the smaller EU member states in particular found disrespectful. 
At the time of his arrest, Mr Hegazy was travelling to Geneva, where he was to report, at the invitation of a United Nations committee, on forced disappearances in Egypt . 
I call on the Egyptian authorities to release Mr Hegazy and to create conditions in Egypt in which human rights defenders and other members of civil society can do their work unhindered – work that is important for the country.” 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the arrest of human rights lawyer Hegazy in Egypt 
The arbitrary arrests of people by organs of the state, without information being provided on their fate or location, deprives those detained of the protection of the law. 
It is not acceptable that the Egyptian authorities prevent people who campaign for others’ human rights to be upheld from doing their work by causing them to disappear, carrying out arbitrary arrests, imposing travel bans, freezing bank accounts, blocking websites, intimidating them or using other forms of repression. 
Lawyer Ibrahim Metwally Hegazy is a co-founder of the Association of the Families of the Disappeared in Egypt. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on North Korea’s latest missile test 
While Turkey has an obligation under international law to grant access, we keep on having to fight for it. 
This is why we are bringing all our diplomatic and political tools to bear to make progress. 
I spoke to Mr Erdogan myself about this when I visited Ankara. 
that it’s neither helpful nor is it in the interests of the person in question to discuss further details in public. 
On the other, they have, for years, seen for example Angela Merkel and her Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble pointing the finger at them and telling them what to do. 
We want to have good relations with Ankara, and 
we’re not going to put them at risk on your behalf.” Perhaps the biggest mistake that Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble made was to abet this increasing division in Europe. 
So you think that the Europeans are divided? 
But wasn't it Mr Schulz who forged ahead in the TV debate and proclaimed the end of the EU accession talks with Turkey as the first objective of his prospective chancellorship? 
the country’s irresponsible and illegal conduct is also aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
Once again, the regime in Pyongyang is demonstrating that it poses a serious threat to world peace. 
I condemn its latest launch of a ballistic missile over Japanese territory in the strongest possible terms. 
We need to stand up resolutely and unambiguously to this threat as the international community and to increase the pressure on the regime in North Korea together. 
I urgently call on North Korea to comply with all applicable UN Security Council resolutions and to immediately cease all activities relating to its illegal missile and nuclear programme without exception.” 
The German Government thus urges the rapid implementation of the most recent UN Security Council resolution and welcomes the convening of an emergency session of the Security Council this afternoon. 
“North Korea is continuing to directly threaten the security of its neighbours and of international shipping and aviation through its reckless missile and nuclear tests. 
Not only do North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests violate the applicable UN Security Council resolutions in the gravest way,

Foreign Minister, how can the world stop the mad dictator Kim? 
Because no one will dare threaten him. 
All sanctions against the regime in North Korea have failed so far. 
Sanctions take time before they start to have an impact. 
We saw this in Iran, for example. 
However, it’s also true that, 
Chancellors Brandt and Schmidt of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) created something to that effect in Europe, 
the US, China and Russia. 
The US is led by Trump, China is riding roughshod over human rights – and Russia still occupies Crimea... 
That’s true. 
However, Willy Brandt’s SPD policy of détente and disarmament began in the darkest hour of the Cold War – 
Then our children will live in a very dangerous world. 
At the Yalta European Strategy, Ukraine reaffirmed its objective of moving closer to the EU and NATO. 
For the fourth time since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in violation of international law, the conference did not take place at its original location, the traditional Ukrainian Black Sea spa resort of Yalta, but in the capital Kyiv. 
Meanwhile, Andreas Peschke will be attending a Ukrainian theatre première at the renowned Kyiv Academic Youth Theatre following the political talks. 
the North Korea crisis, disarmament 
but is pursuing a cold and well‑thought‑out strategy. 
If he has the nuclear bomb, or so he thinks, then his regime is safe. 
What now? 
namely the Conference on Security and Co‑operation in Europe. 
This is only possible via direct negotiations also with North Korea. 
Three powers need to get around the negotiating table together: 
With the Warsaw Pact invasion of Prague in 1968. 
At the end of the day, Brandt and his successor Schmidt and Kohl won out and the German reunification became a reality. 
The time is ripe again for visions and courageous steps. 
North Korea, Syria, Yemen – which conflict is giving you the most cause for concern? 
If North Korea has its way, then many other people will follow this example and acquire nuclear weapons for themselves. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in an interview with the “Bild” daily on the fringes of his visit to China on 17 September 2017. 
North Korean dictator Kim Jong‑un isn’t mad at all, 
like North Korea, we need a guarantee of security other than nuclear weapons. 
As a father of three daughters, I often ask myself 
whether my children will be fortunate enough, like I was, to grow up in times of peace. 
Much is at stake in the nuclear dispute with North Korea. 
“Once again, the regime in Pyongyang is demonstrating that it poses a serious threat to world peace,” Gabriel said. 
Threat to the international community 
“A world that has many small countries with nuclear weapons would be far more dangerous than the East-West confrontation of the past,” Gabriel said. 
In his view, only one conclusion can be drawn from the latest developments.

China plays an important role in the conflict with North Korea. 
The sanctions agreed with the United Nations must be applied fully and systematically. 
Germany and China: bilateral relations 
Strengthening exchange with China through culture 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel visited Beijing on Sunday (17 September) to mobilise support for putting greater pressure on the regime in Pyongyang. 
Putting a stop to North Korea’s nuclear programme – Gabriel in China 
Gabriel visited the Forbidden City in Beijing 
The crisis over North Korea’s illegal nuclear arms programme was the main item on the agenda. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is in no doubt that much is at stake in the crisis 
“This situation can only be prevented if the US works with Russia and China,” he said. 
A two-track strategy comprised of pressure and dialogue 
As almost the only country that has trade relations with North Korea, China has a crucial influence on the isolated regime in Pyongyang. 
During his visit to Beijing, Gabriel thus called for greater international pressure to be exerted on North Korea to halt its illegal conduct. 
Gabriel discussed the crisis in detail with State Councillor Yang Jiechi on Sunday. 
However, he added, it was also vital to launch a political process with North Korea. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel also set the course for the future during his visit. 
More dialogue is needed between German and Chinese societies in order to facilitate greater global cooperation with China. 
with works by over 50 established and young German artists, including Gerhard Richter, Georg Baselitz, Jörg Immendorf, Hilla and Bernd Becher and Neo Rauch, on show at eight locations. 
To this end, Gabriel launched a series of German art events in Beijing, 
where he held talks in the capital Beijing with State Councillor Yang Jiechi. 
If North Korea succeeds in its nuclear weapons programme, many other countries will also acquire nuclear arms. 
“It is clear that a two-track strategy comprised of pressure and dialogue is needed towards North Korea,” Gabriel said. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is in no doubt that much is at stake in the conflict. 
The directors of renowned theatres, museums and film institutions from all over Germany have called on the German Government to set up a programme for persecuted artists. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to China on Sunday (17 September), 
As recently as last Friday (15 September), North Korea fired another ballistic missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. 
Over 50 German artists are on show at the Deutschland 8 exhibition in Beijing 
Deutschland 8, a major exhibition showcasing a huge range of German art in the Chinese capital, 
We need to set up a similar programme for persecuted artists in the next legislative term. 
To this end, I am inviting the signatories of the call to a meeting in early October to discuss the next steps. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel expresses support for an initiative for persecuted artists 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement on this in Berlin today (18 September): 
From our own history, we are all too familiar with attacks on the freedom of science and the arts. 
I will endeavour to ensure that a programme of this type be established and implemented as soon as possible. 
The whole world gathers in New York 
Germany will be represented by Foreign Minister Gabriel.

Crises, wars, conflicts – and what else? 
In addition to current conflicts such as the dispute over North Korea’s nuclear programme, the still unresolved conflict in eastern Ukraine, the war in Syria and the crisis concerning the violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, this year’s UN week is focusing in particular on longer-term common challenges, such as the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and climate policy. 
New faces, new ideas 
UN General Assembly 
US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron will be addressing the General Assembly for the first time since their election. 
He has defined priorities which Germany supports: as well as the coherent implementation of the 2030 Agenda, he wants to strengthen conflict prevention and reorganise the United Nations. 
I think this is a beautiful symbol. 
China’s economy has been opening up for years. 
And the country also has great political responsibility in the world. 
Peace missions are one of the United Nations’ hallmarks. 
Germany has increased its involvement in UN peace missions considerably in recent years. 
They have continued to grow in importance in recent years as an instrument of crisis prevention and crisis management. 
One of his key priorities is therefore crisis prevention, which Germany is also supporting. 
Peacekeeping: 
plans for reform and the primacy of politics 
The primacy of politics is an express focus in all of this. 
I welcome the call for a programme to protect persecuted artists and would be pleased if this important initiative met with widespread support. 
This makes it all the more important that we do everything we can today to protect and extend academic and artistic freedom where it is at risk of being lost, using our cultural relations and education policy to do so. 
In the Philipp Schwartz Initiative for persecuted academics we have already created a successful blueprint for supporting people who have had to flee from conflicts or who are threatened for defending fundamental rights. 
It is particularly important that we do not only help those who stand up for the freedom of culture and the arts once they have arrived in Germany, but rather that we already provide support where they are prevented from playing their part in society. 
We cannot allow societies in other places to lose the creativity of artists, intellectuals and pioneers because governments are not willing or able to protect and foster people in their creativity. 
Marion Ackermann (Director General of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections), Amelie Deuflhard (Director of Kampnagel Internationale Kulturfabrik GmbH), Dieter Kosslick (Director of the Berlin International Film Festival), Shermin Langhoff (Director of the Maxim Gorki Theater), Matthias Lilienthal (Director of the Münchner Kammerspiele), Joachim Lux (Director of the Thalia Theater), Thomas Ostermeier (Artistic Director/ Resident Director of the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz), Wolfgang Tillmans (artist), Annemie Vanackere (Director of HAU Hebbel am Ufer), Stefan Weber (Director of the Museum of Islamic Art in the Pergamon Museum ) and Peter Weibel (artist, curator and art and media expert, ZKM Karlsruhe) called on the next German Government today to set up a programme for persecuted artists. 
The Federal Foreign Office has been running the Philipp Schwartz Initiative in cooperation with the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation since 2015. This initiative enables persecuted academics to continue their work at German research institutes for two years. 
Peace missions are not the solution, but are a political instrument to support peace processes. 
New York: the city that never sleeps – this week at least, that will most likely be true. 
Germany has increased its involvement in UN peacekeeping considerably in recent years. 
It is often also the only opportunity to meet the representatives of smaller states. 
Another priority is the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. 
On Thursday (21 September), Foreign Minister Gabriel will give a speech to the General Assembly outlining Germany’s foreign and peace policy within the framework of the United Nations. 
What is more, this is the first general debate for UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who has been in office since January. He intends to make the United Nations fit for the challenges of the future with a comprehensive reform agenda. 
More than just side events: the meetings around the general debate 
Making capabilities available for improved planning 
But in Germany, this number of visitors was really extraordinarily high. 
The German Foreign Minister will also discuss current conflicts – from Ukraine to North Korea and from disarmament to denuclearisation – in bilateral talks with numerous counterparts, for example those from China and Russia. 
Over 120,000 blue helmets from 127 countries are currently deployed in 15 missions around the world. 
And I can also promise you that the exhibition truly shows the best that Germany has to offer in terms of contemporary art. 
It is currently Germany’s biggest deployment abroad with up to one thousand soldiers and twenty police officers. 
The Federal Government is also providing further support in the form of training courses for third countries in the context of its comprehensive stabilisation efforts, as well as through providing German expertise. 
Over one thousand German soldiers and police officers are currently supporting ten peace missions. 
and when people have the opportunity to be impressed or inspired by the other country’s art or culture. 
That is how we see a living partnership. 
However, this type of partnership requires not only dedicated people, but also the right sort of policies. 
Above all, we need mutual openness and interest. 
According to Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, the purpose of the organisation is “to maintain world peace and international security”. 
We need to be open to what unites us, but also to be aware of differences and to learn how to deal with them. 
And of course we know that this sometimes causes problems. 
Art can really serve as a good example for us. 
It can help to express the ineffable. 
From 19 to 26 September numerous Heads of State and Government as well as Foreign Ministers are gathering at the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly. 
For from tomorrow (19 September), many of the 193 Heads of State and Government as well as Foreign Ministers will be coming together for the 72nd UN General Assembly to discuss the current crises in the world. 
The ministerial week – or officially the general debate at the start of a new session of the General Assembly – is the world’s biggest political forum. 
The President of the 72nd session of the General Assembly – whose theme this year is “Focusing on people” – is the Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák, who officially opened the new session on 12 September. 
This year there will again be a number of events on the whole spectrum of world politics and on the key global issues such as migration, climate change and development, terrorism and disarmament. 
Germany will also be promoting its candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council in 2019/20 at the 72nd session of the General Assembly. 
Germany’s candidacy for a seat on the Security Council in 2019/20 
By the way, it is amazing how many young people in Germany are learning Chinese at school or want to study it later at university. 
I think that is a very good sign for our future. 
I also have the impression that cultural and societal contacts are most effective and authentic when they are not only steered by the state. 
Depending on their mandate, the peace missions support political processes within the context of stabilisation measures, e.g. by promoting mediation efforts between conflict parties. 
On a mission for peace: Germany as a partner in UN peacekeeping 
I am particularly grateful to them. 
Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes it is enough to have one or two interpreters for an hour’s dialogue. 
And I am curious about what idea Professor Smerling will come up with next to foster cultural exchange between Germany and China. 
Thank you very much. 
Since 2000 there has been a substantial increase in UN-led peacekeeping (so-called blue helmet missions), and special political missions, 
with currently around 120,000 people (soldiers, police officers and other civilian personnel) involved in such missions throughout the world. 
The bulk of UN peacekeepers are deployed in Africa, and this will presumably continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
Peacekeeping on the agenda of the UN general debate 
German soldiers during their UNIFIL deployment off the coast of Lebanon 
Peacekeeping is on the agenda of the general debate of the 72nd UN General Assembly taking place from 19 September, which Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will be attending. 
UN Secretary‑General Guterres intends to reform the UN Secretariat in order, among other things, to make peace missions even more effective. 
New global challenges, new types of conflicts and discussions surrounding the budget are increasing the pressure to undertake reform in the area of UN peace missions. 
A high‑level panel to assess the peacekeeping architecture recently submitted numerous proposals to bring about greater efficiency, which UN Secretary‑General Guterres has now taken up. 
These include more rapid deployment of operational troops, more flexible mandates, the deployment of new technologies, greater cooperation with regional organisations and improved collaboration between actors. 
Germany is an active player in the area of peacekeeping. 
The UN mission MINUSMA in Mali is a particular focus of Germany's engagement. 
UN peace mission in Juba, South Sudan Alongside providing German personnel, Germany is supporting the peace missions financially as the fourth‑largest contributor to the peacekeeping budget (after the US, Japan and China). 
For instance, Germany seconded a team from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief to support the peace mission in Colombia at the request of the UN in order to assist the establishment of the mission’s communications infrastructure in the region. 
A further focus of Germany’s efforts is in supporting the planning of peace missions – rapidly deployable capabilities for peace missions are particularly important in this regard. 
It was with this in mind that the Federal Government made additional capabilities for the missions at the beginning of September 2017, including a reconnaissance company, mine‑clearance operatives, hospitals and air transport personnel. 
Joint press statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel and Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media Grütters: 
Comprehensive reforms of UN peacekeeping have therefore been initiated at international level; these will be pursued under the leadership of UN Secretary-General Guterres. 
In particular, I would like to thank the Chinese Government, but also the exhibition organisers and the sponsors, for giving us the opportunity to open the doors to contemporary art and cultural dialogue in this formerly closed city. 
Germany’s engagement in these missions is therefore part of a coordinated peacekeeping approach. 
And now pictures and contemporary art have made their way in the opposite direction from Duisburg to Beijing via the new Silk Road. 
which is around 466.4 million US dollars. 
And the fact that the ceremony took place in Duisburg, at the Inner Harbour, was also a special symbol of the new Silk Road, which the Chinese President had inaugurated just a short time before with the arrival of the first freight train from China in Duisburg. 
proof that the exhibition whetted people’s interest in China. 
And nothing is more important than interest in one another. 
and told me he would have to travel to Beijing simply to see it, as he could not see an exhibition of this kind in just one place in Germany. 
As you know, there is a huge amount of trade between Germany and China. Many people envy us for this. I think there is interest on both the Chinese and German side in developing these trade relations further, particularly at a time when new walls are being built in international trade or some people want to replace free world trade with protectionism.

With this residency programme, we intend to offer a platform for discussions and discourse that is able to counter increasing confrontation and polarisation. 
Alongside purely military peacekeeping tasks, these operations therefore also assume a wide range of civilian duties. 
They are also involved in supporting security sector reform, destroying small arms, monitoring elections and democratic processes, building rule-of-law institutions and monitoring the human rights situation. 
But this openness and interest also mean that we need to confront our different – and sometimes conflicting – ideas, mentalities and values. 
We need to do so as equals who constantly endeavour to understand why the other person sees the world differently to us. 
The broad spectrum of tasks undertaken by UN-led missions and the great increase in their size and scope as a result of the complexity of the crises in the world demonstrate the importance of these missions, but also present the UN system with significant challenges in terms of planning, implementing and concluding missions. 
At times, it can be unsettling. 
It can help to reveal contradictions so that a society can be perceived in its entirety. 
In a conflict-ridden world, it is more important than ever for us to create and protect spheres outside the realm of politics that facilitate exchange and understanding. 
What role do policymakers play in this? 
In my opinion, they should create the conditions whereby artistic and societal exchange is made possible and easier 
and the threshold for all those who want to get involved in cultural dialogue is as low as possible. And naturally, we also need to promote youth exchange and language training. 
We policymakers have a role to play here. And we are keen to do so. 
In times of challenging transatlantic relations, the purchase of the Thomas Mann House is a stroke of good fortune and also a great obligation. 
And in particular, I would like to thank the Chinese Government for making this project possible. 
The residency programme is funded by the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. 
It aims to give outstanding individuals from all fields of German society, particularly from the realms of culture, academia, business, politics and the media, the opportunity to address the major questions of our time and to enter into a dialogue and network with individuals and institutions in the US. 
The fellows nominated today will inaugurate the Thomas Mann House in the coming year. 
The Federal Government sets great store by the dialogue with the US. 
The Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media would like to thank the Berthold Leibinger Stiftung, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation and the Robert Bosch Stiftung for their generous support. 
Prof. Jutta Allmendinger, Prof. Heinrich Detering, Mr Burghart Klaußner, Prof. Yiannos Manoli and Dr Sylke Tempel will live and work in Los Angeles in the coming year. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement on this in Berlin today (19 September): 
Monika Grütters, Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, stated the following: 
While in exile in the last century, Thomas Mann raised his voice for freedom and for democratic and open societies as one of the most important writers and intellectuals of his age. 
Culture and the media have an indispensable role to play in this regard. 
Where intellectual discourse is neglected and critical journalism is unwelcome, it will fall to outstanding individuals to do all that they can to stand up for the freedom of the arts and the press, as well as for social cohesion. 
As regards a cultural opening, there is no better place than here in the Forbidden City. 
Nowhere in the world, including our homeland, will you find so much contemporary art concentrated in one place and over a long period, an exhibition that features all the artists who have made contemporary art from Germany internationally renowned. 
It is the Federal Government’s aim to make Germany’s voice even more clearly heard in the US with regard to the key issues of our time. 
fellows nominated for the Thomas Mann House in Los Angeles 
Almost 120,000 people visited the exhibitions in eight different locations in Germany’s industrial heartland. 
That figure is perhaps not particularly impressive in China compared with the size of the country’s population. 
And what makes me even happier is that the exhibition attracted a particularly large number of young people. 
I’m not sure if 120,000 people count as a city or a village here. 
In fact, a German art expert recently spoke to me about the exhibition in China 
However, I also see this exhibition project as a symbol of the constantly developing relations between China and Germany and the opening of new fields for direct communication and exchange. 
We also have a political dialogue that not only takes place at regular intervals, but also in a spirit of mutual trust. 
However, we do not want to leave it at that, as bilateral relations thrive on contacts between people from our two societies, not only between politicians, diplomats and business people. 
Our relations will become even closer when young people learn more about the other country through exchanges and visits 
I have not forgotten the debate about the exhibition on the Enlightenment here in Beijing organised by Martin Roth, who sadly died far too young. 
In this role in particular, art does something important that only it can do. 
Dealing with art and culture forces us to change our point of view. 
And to do so, there must be freedom. 
Freedom of the arts and culture is the main requirement for their development. 
Art and culture foster exchange in society, but do not bow down to policymakers. 
That is why I am pleased that artistic and societal exchange is also continuing to grow between China and Germany. 
We promote and initiate such projects, but of course we also need civil society, dedicated artists and people like Walter Smerling. In his case, I always have the impression that if a project sounds particularly utopian, you can be sure he will make it happen. 
This exhibition would not have come about without these two individuals and their personal commitment and conviction that what seems impossible can be made possible. 
However, the important non-state actors also include the German and Chinese companies that made a vital contribution to funding the exhibition. 
It would not have been possible to finance the exhibition without these companies from Germany and China. 
I thus hope there will be a particularly high level of understanding here. 
In December 2015, a Security Council resolution on Youth, Peace and Security (SCR 2250 (2015)) was adopted for the first time. 
The first Envoy on Youth was also appointed by the UN Secretary-General in 2015; Jayathma Wickramanayake from Sri Lanka has held this post since August 2017. 
German personnel in UN peace missions 
Germany currently has around 3500 Bundeswehr soldiers and approximately 130 police officers serving with international peace missions. 
Most of the German soldiers and police officers currently deployed on peace missions are serving with the United Nations peace mission in Mali in order to support the peace and reconciliation process within the country and to stabilise the region beyond Mali itself. 
Germany is also involved in NATO and EU operations as well as international coalitions within the framework of the United Nations system of mutual security. 
German soldiers and police officers are also deployed on the following international missions and activities: 
Germany supports this engagement directly through participation in the missions, provision of funding for UN aid organisations and our own peacebuilding measures, which complement the UN’s approaches. 
In addition, Germany pays assessed contributions to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and to specialised agencies and other UN entities. 
Germany also makes large voluntary contributions to individual UN programmes, for example in the field of humanitarian assistance, and supports the US in the field of crisis prevention.

Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the opening of the Deutschland 8 exhibition in Beijing 
Professor Fan Dian, Professor Smerling, Ambassadors, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, 
It is a great honour and pleasure for me to open the Deutschland 8 exhibition here with you in this special place, in what was once the Forbidden City, against the backdrop of the magnificent Taimiao, the Imperial Ancestral Temple. 
Even in Germany itself, there is nothing like the Deutschland 8 exhibition in China. 
Deutschland 8 is the latest response in this cultural dialogue between Germany and China. 
It ties in directly with the China 8 exhibition, the first major contemporary Chinese art show in Germany, which was held two years ago in eight different locations in Land North Rhine‑Westphalia. 
At the time, I also had the honour to be invited by Professor Smerling to open the exhibition. 
I still have a vivid memory of the ceremony at Duisburg Inner Harbour, in what you might say is our ancestral gallery – the steel town of Duisburg in Germany’s industrial heartland. 
China 8 was a great success in Germany. At the time, it was the largest exhibition of contemporary Chinese art ever shown in museums abroad. 
Almost 40 percent of the visitors were aged under 35 – 
Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that Deutschland 8 will prove popular in Beijing and that many people will take part in the dialogue. 
We launched the People‑to‑People Dialogue in May – a start that is likely to lead to many positive developments. 
It can hold up a mirror to society and politics – and indeed sometimes it must do so. 
It can help to make nuances visible and sometimes it also forces us politicians to change our perspective rather than looking at things in the same old way in the daily grind. 
I think the fact that the Federal Foreign Office in Germany currently spends close to a billion euros on cultural relations and education policy is a good investment in our mutual peaceful future. 
I think Deutschland 8 is the best example of this, as it was non‑state actors who were particularly active in organising it. 
In particular, I would like to thank Professor Fan Dian, President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and of course Professor Walter Smerling, Chairman of the Foundation for Art and Culture, whom I have already mentioned. 
I would also like to thank the directors of the seven venues where the exhibition is being shown and naturally the guardian of this wonderful temple. 
But apparently, that was not enough for the organisers of Deutschland 8, as they have brought interpreters for 55 artists and 320 works of art as ambassadors and interpreters of cultural dialogue to Beijing. 
I also hope that all of us will enjoy a highly successful Deutschland 8 exhibition.

Reform endeavours are also under way in other areas. 
thus making it the fourth-largest financial contributor to the regular budget, behind the US (22 per cent), Japan (9.7 per cent) and China (7.9 per cent). 
The budget earmarked for peace missions for the period from July 2017 to June 2018 is approximately 7.3 billion dollars. 
The largest financial contributors ahead of Germany are the US (28.6 per cent), China (10.3 per cent) and Japan (9.7 per cent). 
Apart from its financial contribution, Germany primarily provides support to UN peace missions though civilian instruments and by promoting stabilisation mechanisms, diplomatic mediation efforts and post-conflict peacebuilding. 
Germany’s engagement is accompanied by its continued participation in EU missions, such as the EU Training Mission in Mali and the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Mali. 
Further key areas of Germany’s support include the NATO and EU operations in Afghanistan and the Balkans, maritime missions in the Mediterranean and the Horn of Africa, and the fight against IS in Syria and Iraq. 
All of the deployments are conducted within the framework of mutual collective security and in accordance with its rule. 
To this end, he has defined priorities that Germany supports. In addition to the coherent implementation of the 2030 Agenda, he wants to enhance conflict prevention and reorganise the UN. 
In November 2010, Berlin hosted the Second Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum, which brought together over 200 representatives of civil society organisations from across the EU and from partner countries. 
The fact that one of the exhibition locations 
which, as it were, is opening its doors to German art, 
is to my mind a lovely symbol, 
Opening up access like this, step by step, including with China, 
everyone who has played a part. 
This is why we are seeking to enter a dialogue on many levels and working to expand our hubs for access to culture and education on the other side of the Atlantic, especially with a view to the Year of Germany in the United States scheduled to take place in 2018. 
Further information about the Thomas Mann House and about the fellowships is available on the website of Villa Aurora & Thomas Mann House: 
In difficult times when some things separate us across the Atlantic, cultural exchange is paramount for open societies and for our common transatlantic foundation of values. 
The Federal Foreign Office purchased the Thomas Mann House, which is currently undergoing renovation work, in November 2016. 
This applies not only to the political dialogue with the Administration, but also and especially to the dialogue among societies conducted by intellectuals, artists, academics and journalists. 
Villa Aurora & Thomas Mann House are responsible for the residency programme. The association has operated the artists’ residence Villa Aurora since 1995. Villa Aurora was the exile residence of Marta and Lion Feuchtwanger in Pacific Palisades and offers a well-established infrastructure in Los Angeles. 
The Eastern Partnership 
The Eastern Partnership also fosters the countries’ relations with one another. 
Key aspects of the Eastern Partnership 
Germany – the fourth-largest financial contributor 
Germany is active in a large number of UN committees, institutions and peace missions and has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council five times, most recently in 2011‑12. 
Germany contributes 6.4 per cent of this budget, that is, approximately 161.1 million dollars per year, 
Germany currently contributes 6.4 per cent of that amount, that is, around 466.4 million dollars per year. It is thus also the fourth‑largest financial contributor in this area. 
The permanent members of the Security Council pay a higher share because of their special responsibility for peace missions. 
Some 3500 German security forces are currently deployed to international UN, NATO, EU and OSCE peace missions. 
Since the beginning of 2017, Germany’s military and police role has focused on the UN peace mission MINUSMA, which provides stabilisation support to Mali and the entire Sahel region. 
Germany also deploys staff to numerous missions that are under direct UN leadership, such as the missions in Lebanon, the Western Sahara and the Sudan. 
Germany therefore actively supports this reform along with its G4 partners Brazil, India and Japan. 
UN Secretary‑General António Guterres wants to carry out a comprehensive reform agenda to make the UN fit for the challenges of the future. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement in Berlin this evening (19 September) prior to his departure for New York: 
“We are travelling to New York today with certain expectations.

The international community is meeting this week at the 72nd General Assembly of the United Nations. 
is the former Forbidden City, 
because we need cultural relations. 
And of course art must be free; 
it should serve social exchange, 
but it should not be a servant of politics. 
is a truly valuable task, and I would like to thank 
Once again, the General Assembly is taking place at a time of crises and conflicts, the enormous challenge of eradicating poverty and hunger, and a nascent East-West conflict. 
When – as in New York this week – political decision-makers from all over the world convene, this is always an opportunity to strive for solutions and to make progress in talks and meetings. 
Beyond the crisis with North Korea, the wars, conflicts and humanitarian disasters in eastern Ukraine and Syria, on Qatar, on the Iranian nuclear programme, and in Myanmar, Yemen and elsewhere, this is our key message at a time in which confrontation is taking the place of willingness to work together, rearmament has supplanted arms control and transparency, and our world has certainly not become a more peaceful place since the last General Assembly of the United Nations. 
To this end, the world needs a United Nations that fosters the values of the Charter, can respond rapidly and effectively, and receives the resources needed for its work from the member states. 
That is what is needed now and it can only be achieved if we work together!” 
The German Foreign Minister must be there, even during the election campaign. 
They help to make our internet presence more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. 
It is his first General Assembly. Prior to his departure, he expressed great expectations of the coming days:

The conflict on eastern Ukraine and the crisis in Qatar are further reasons for Gabriel to hold bilateral talks with his counterparts from all over the world. 
A strong United Nations with Germany in the Security Council 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said: 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel prior to his departure for New York 
As the member states of the United Nations (UN) convene for their 72nd General Assembly this week, the focus is on international crises and conflicts. 
Despite the general election in Germany on 24 September, the German Foreign Minister must not miss the General Assembly. 
The smouldering conflict on North Korea shows that this debate has acquired new relevance. 
General Assembly week in New York is the best place for all those involved to discuss international conflicts. 
There is more contact between countries in New York this week than anywhere else in the world. 
The members will strive to achieve solutions at a large number of bilateral talks and events in New York. 
Underlining Germany’s support for disarmament 
In his speech to the General Assembly, which is scheduled for Thursday afternoon (21 September), Gabriel plans to underline Germany’s support for greater disarmament rather than rearmament. 
It is thus vital to make the United Nations more effective on a permanent basis. 
European Neighbourhood Policy and thus the Eastern Partnership are part of the EU’s foreign policy and therefore separate from accession policy. 
A new agreement is currently being negotiated with Azerbaijan. 
Belarus is the only country with which a framework agreement has not yet been concluded. 
Almost half of the world population is under 24 years of age and 85 percent of young people live in developing countries – these numbers alone show how important it is for the United Nations to take the concerns of the young into particular consideration. 
Among the documents available for download are the World Programme of Action for Youth and the most recent United Nations World Youth Report (2017). 
At the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga on 21 and 22 May 2015, good governance, market opportunities, mobility/people-to-people contacts and interconnections were chosen as key areas for cooperation. 
The EU continues to monitor the ongoing fulfilment of the necessary standards after visa requirements have been eased. 
Global problems require global solutions – Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to the UN General Assembly week in New York 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with UN Secretary‑General Guterres 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travelled to New York on Tuesday evening (19 September). 
The “Non‑Violence” sculpture by Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd in front of the UN Headquarters in New York 
The Foreign Minister will call for concrete initiatives on nuclear disarmament at several appointments, including the meeting of the Non‑Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) and on the Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT), and in smaller meetings, for example on the nuclear agreement with Iran. 
During General Assembly week, Gabriel will therefore hold talks with colleagues from North Korea’s neighbouring countries on how the tense situation can be de‑escalated by political means. 
“We certainly need the United Nations to play a greater role – not a smaller one. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the E3/EU+3 Foreign Ministers meeting with Iran 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (20 September) ahead of the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the E3+3 countries (Russia, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany), the High Representative of the Union and Iran: 
Strict technical restrictions and comprehensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme is and remains exclusively peaceful. 
In its latest quarterly report on 31 August, the IAEA confirmed that Iran was meeting its nuclear-related obligations. 
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has blocked all paths to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. 
The JCPOA is an important cornerstone for regional and global security and strengthens the global regime of nuclear non-proliferation by ensuring that Iran meets all of its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). 
[Foreign Minister Gabriel also met his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, for bilateral talks today (20 September) on the margins of his visit to New York.] 
It is thus all the more important that Iran refrain from doing anything that feeds mistrust and conflicts and instead participate constructively in endeavours to resolve regional conflicts. 
We are willing to provide support here. At the same time, the human rights situation must finally be improved. 
As Germans and Europeans, we have every interest in the agreement being implemented strictly and comprehensively and in all sides continuing to meet their obligations, with no strings attached. 
we stand united with our European partners and the EU on the agreement and will stand up for it towards all those involved.” 
“The developments in and surrounding North Korea are a stark reminder for us of what can happen if there is almost a complete lack of regulations or control mechanisms for containing a conflict. Above all, they bring home to us the potential for escalation inherent in such a situation. 
This makes the benefits of the 2015 Vienna nuclear agreement even clearer. 
The vast majority of Iranians wants President Rouhani’s policies to proceed and for the country to continue opening up internally and externally. They hope for economic progress and investments and expect greater civil liberties. 
This path will become incomparably harder if the Vienna nuclear agreement with Iran is tampered with. 
That is why the clear message this evening will be that 
During Foreign Minister Gabriel’s visit to the opening of the 72nd General Assembly of the United Nations, one of the major topics on the agenda is the further implementation of the Vienna nuclear agreement with Iran (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA). 
The countries involved in the JCPOA (the E3+3 and Iran) are meeting at foreign minister level today (20 September). The meeting will be chaired by Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. 
This is the second meeting of this kind since the start of implementation of the JCPOA (Implementation Day on 16 January 2016). 
At the same time, the Eastern Partnership aims to promote enhanced cooperation between all the partners. 
Corresponding platforms have been set up, which allow projects in these areas to be discussed and agreed upon and in which all EU and partner countries may participate, often in cooperation with international organisations (such as the OSCE or the Council of Europe) or non-governmental organisations. 
It is envisaged that third countries will also be eligible to participate on a case-by-case basis. 
Stabilisation and mediation: the mediators 
Germany is seeking to help crisis states with peace mediation. 
But what does mediation mean in practice? 
Yemen mediators Ali Saif and Oliver Wils from the Berghof Foundation in the Atrium of the Federal Foreign Office. 
Germany supports their work. 
Ali Saif rushes over to Oliver Wils, plate in hand. 
“Look over there, over there to the right”, he whispers. 
These direct talks are the breakthrough that the organisers had hoped for. 
Wils and Saif work as mediators for the Berghof Foundation, which specialises in conflict resolution and which receives funding from the Federal Foreign Office’s Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance. 
Wils is standing at the middle of the tables, which are arranged in a horseshoe shape. 
Behind him are two partition walls with flash cards. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel after the E3+3 meeting with Iran 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement after the E3+3 Foreign Ministers meeting with Iran in New York: 
“Security” is there, “lack of trust” and “future of the state”. 
The Americans are right: 
To date, over 2000 nuclear weapon tests have been carried out worldwide. 
The most recent nuclear test was conducted by North Korea on 3 September 2017. 
Iran is still not playing a constructive role in the Middle East, be it in Yemen or Lebanon. 
We agree that 
I firmly believe that neither the volatile and tense situation in the region nor Iran’s conduct would improve if the nuclear agreement is no longer observed.” 
And if someone gets really upset, then he’s been known to bring them coffee and cake. 
Above all, mediators need patience and stamina for their mediation work. 
But it’s difficult for the Berghof team not to feel under pressure in the face of the situation in Yemen, which is desperate. 
As if things weren’t bad enough already, cholera has also broken out. 
While Germany has already increased humanitarian support for Yemen by a factor of twenty since 2015, access on the part of international aid organisations to those in need is patchy and the problems are enormous. 
The German Government is therefore committed to ensuring that nuclear tests are prohibited around the world and that the tests conducted by North Korea since 2006 remain the last of their kind. 
While there is already a United Nations roadmap for negotiations in Yemen, 
Not all parties to the conflict are prepared to seriously commit to it. 
“We are trying to lay the groundwork for the UN negotiations”, says Ali Saif. 
For example, in Iraq. 
It is therefore all the more urgent for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to enter into force as soon as possible. 
Germany has therefore decided to make available an additional 250 million euros for the reconstruction of Mosul. 
“It is in our utmost interest not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement with Iran and certainly not to end it now or in the future. 
In the past two years, we have seen that the agreement is working and that it has prevented a dangerous nuclear proliferation in the region because everyone, including the Iranians, has adhered to the obligations arising from it and the International Atomic Energy Agency’s monitoring mechanisms are effective. 
we must discuss and address this, but not by means of a working regional nuclear arms control agreement. 
Every nuclear test is one too many – more than 2000 such tests have been carried out worldwide since 1945. 
The large number of tests led to the rapid development of this weapons technology, with the explosive power of a single bomb rising exponentially over the decades. 
The Berghof Foundation is one of the world’s few organisations to entertain high-level channels of communication with all parties to the conflict in Yemen. 
Part of the art of mediation is simply inviting the right people at the right time. 
Are they willing to talk? 
Are they actually able to represent their group’s political leadership 
and to keep to agreements? 
He has set the right priorities. 
At the centre of the conflict are the Huthi, a rebel group from the north, on the border with Saudi Arabia. 
In my view, the reform efforts should not focus primarily on cutbacks. 
At present, however, the figures tell a different story: 
We have to change course here. 
They belong to a Shiite sub-group, the Zaidis, and are loosely allied with Iran, which considers itself to be the guardian of all Shiites. 
Germany is ready and willing to shoulder additional responsibility. 
We intend to work in partnership with all members of the United Nations – in Africa, Asia, America and Europe. 
Let us work on this together! 
This is not just a question of power, however, but also emotions as all those involved have lost family members or friends, seen a great deal of suffering and been through a lot. 
“You have to believe yourself that it’s going to work”. 
As responsible politicians, it is vital that we ask ourselves: 
Lunch at the InterContinental Hotel in Berlin. 
I find this analysis very apt. 
“They’re talking!” The two men glance discreetly at one of the tables opposite. 
Just the evening before, the delegates from Saudi Arabia and the Huthi militia from Yemen didn’t even want to sit next to each other at the conference table. 
This occasion is no exception. 
Wils holds the microphone and chairs the discussions. 
Like a therapist, Wils must have a good feel for when he lets someone speak and when he interrupts them. 
“now is not the time to play ping-pong.” 
His colleague Saif is sitting among the delegates. 
He knows everyone in the room well, built up trust on the ground in Yemen, had initially to persuade many people to come, took care of visas and flights, listened to their reservations and made sure that they feel safe. 
If delegates need space from each other, then he sits between them. 
And if that doesn’t help and a delegate storms out of the room, then he runs after them. 
This humanitarian assistance only helps to alleviate the symptoms of the crisis at the end of the day. 
With mediation and stabilisation, the Federal Foreign Office also intends to ensure that causes and solutions are addressed so that peace stands a chance of returning. 
it’s not working. 
Delegates sometimes meet in Jordan, and sometimes in Lebanon and Berlin. 
Saif and Wils are a perfect team. 
They meet experts from the Federal Foreign Office for discussions on a regular basis. 
This alliance managed to expel the Government of President Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi, which was recognised as legitimate by the international community, from the capital Sana’a, in 2014. 
Since then, the military alliance led by Saudi Arabia has bombarded the neighbouring country, and Sana’a in particular. 
For Oliver Wils and Ali Saif, the mere fact that everyone that they invited actually came to Berlin, sat around a table and talked to each other is therefore a major success. 
They are hopeful that the next meeting will produce tangible agreements on security and confidence-building measures. 
In the background, you can hear the muffled voices of the simultaneous interpreters in a booth. 
He addresses everyone by their name, gives encouraging nods, summarises or admonishes them: 
Keeping channels of communication open and laying the groundwork for negotiations 
The Berghof Foundation is creating the scope for this that no longer exists in Yemen in this form and at this high level. 
Oliver Wils is acquainted with this multi-front conflict down to the very last detail. 
We have to send a clear message: the international community will not accept North Korea’s nuclear provocations. 
It will be a long time until peace is established, but until then no step forward is too small. 
“I’m an optimist at the end of the day”, says Wils. 
That applies in particular to the agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. 
But only if all obligations are rigorously adhered to and the agreed transparency is created, can the urgently needed confidence grow. 
This is not only about Iran. 
This is about the credibility of the international community. 
For which state would refrain from developing its own nuclear programme if it turns out that negotiated agreements do not endure and confidence in agreements with the international community are not worth the paper they are written on? 
However, we have to make sure that we do not create an imbalance. 
These days, I suspect that not even half a day would be necessary. 
It is also important to strengthen a democratic and inclusive Iraqi state – and to ensure that the actions of an individual region do not leave it exposed to a renewed threat of destabilisation. 
The Minsk agreements provide a clear road map for peace, in the elaboration of which Germany played a key role. 
It is based on the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the inviolability of borders. 
The North-South Commission pointed out that focusing solely on questions of war and peace is not enough. 
Agenda 2030 shows that the international community has identified this as a “common interest”. 
The founders of the United Nations were not naive – they had experienced the horrors of the first half of the 20th century. 
For that very reason, they bequeathed to us the UN Charter with its timeless principles and maxims. 
Although the principles of the United Nations are not outdated, the world organisation has to adapt to the challenges of our time. 
I believe that we as member states should now adopt a further reform project which is long overdue: 
Yes, this is an arduous process. 
However, we have to muster up the courage to go down this path. 
We firmly believe “that problems created by men can also be solved by men”. 
“I firmly believe that it falls to Germany in particular to promote détente, political dialogue, diplomatic solutions, solidarity, cooperation and peaceful exchange, both between East and West and North and South.” 
Maintaining the agreement with Iran and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
Foreign Minister Gabriel surrounded by journalists in New York 
On the first day of his visit, Gabriel conducted a large number of talks, including with his counterparts from Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Ukraine. 
The crisis on the nuclear dispute with North Korea shows how acute the risk of global nuclear armament has become. 
“If the international community does not succeed in preventing the development of nuclear weapons in North Korea, other countries will follow suit and also acquire nuclear arms,” Gabriel said in New York. 
“In this era of crises and conflicts, the values of the Charter of the United Nations and cooperation between its members under the auspices of the United Nations are perhaps more important than ever.” 
Foreign Minister Gabriel at the UN General Assembly in New York 
At the same time, we have to make use of all diplomatic means at our disposal, first of all to defuse the situation and subsequently to find a point of departure for long-term solutions. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has travelled to the UN General Assembly in New York. 
It cannot be that striving to build up a nuclear arsenal leads to success on the international stage. 
The event, to which Heads of State and Government travel from all over the world, is taking place at a crisis-ridden time that includes the nuclear dispute with North Korea, discussions on the nuclear agreement with Iran, the developments in eastern Ukraine and the situation facing refugees from Myanmar. 
Germany will work within the E3+3 framework to ensure that the agreement is strictly implemented and that it is upheld. 
“In the past two years, we have seen that the agreement is working and that it has prevented a dangerous nuclear proliferation in the region,” he said. 
“We certainly need the United Nations to play a greater role – not a smaller one,” Gabriel said. 
Germany supports the Secretary-General’s endeavours and urges reform of the Security Council in particular. 
To this end, Gabriel will attend high-level meetings on the comprehensive reforms planned by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. 
How we can bring about a change in direction? 
We have to act as quickly as possible here – in the form of both political and humanitarian support – in order to alleviate the suffering and end the conflict. 
Rather, these issues are inextricably linked to the fair distribution of resources, to economic and social development and to respect for universal human rights. 
The World Food Programme receives less than 50% of the funding needed to combat the world’s hunger crises today. 
Germany, at any rate, intends to maintain its financial support for the United Nations. 
With regard to the nuclear agreement with Iran, Gabriel urged that the treaty, which was only achieved after great efforts, should not be jeopardised. 
The UN Security Council 
but must also work towards overcoming “world hunger, mass misery and alarming disparities between the living conditions of rich and poor.” 
We must not limit ourselves to the “traditional questions of peace and war,” 
Existing treaties and agreements must not be called into question. 
How well the reform of the United Nations succeeds is largely up to us, the member states. 
We have to work together to give the United Nations more clout and more efficiency. 
Russia’s relations with the Eastern Partnership 
Its commitment to closer relations with the EU is not affected by Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. 
Information on Ukraine 
Belarus in the context of the Eastern Partnership 
This investigation has not yet been concluded. 
We therefore informed the Vietnamese side in a meeting with the Vietnamese Ambassador at the Federal Foreign Office yesterday that the strategic partnership with Viet Nam is being temporarily suspended. 
He now has four weeks to leave Germany with his family. 
We expect Viet Nam to meet our demands. 
The Vietnamese side knows how it can restore bilateral relations and rectify the violation of the law and breach of trust. 
The abduction involves a blatant violation of German and international law. 
In declaring the head of intelligence at the Vietnamese Embassy persona non grata, we have already taken the first clear steps. 
Nor has Viet Nam pledged to hold the responsible parties to account. 
Immediately after the case came to light, we made it clear that the abduction on German territory was completely unacceptable. 
There is clear evidence for this abduction, which will be made available to the public in due course. 
The Federal Public Prosecutor General took over the investigation on 10 August. 
Under no circumstances will we tolerate this. 
We have conveyed our demands unambiguously to the Vietnamese Government several times and made clear that we reserve the right to take further measures. 
We have made demands regarding Trinh Xuan Thanh, including that his trial be conducted in accordance with the rule of law and give access to international observers. 
As Viet Nam has not met any of our demands in any way or recognised the violation of the law and the breach of trust as such so far, we are obliged to take further steps. 
We have also declared a further employee of the Vietnamese Embassy persona non grata. 
To date, the Vietnamese Government has not complied with our demands that it make an apology and provide an assurance that the law will not be violated again in this way in the future. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (22 September) in response to new developments in the case of Vietnamese citizen Trinh Xuan Thanh, who was abducted from Berlin: 
End to a fifty-year conflict 
The Federal Agency for Technical Relief has taken more than 8800 weapons and over twenty thousand munition cartridges out of commission using diamond cutters and plasma cutting devices with a precise cutting technique. 
Together with the funds that allowed disarmament to begin without delay at the beginning of the year, the Federal Government has contributed over 800,000 euros to this disarmament process to date. 
More than 8000 guerillas laid down their weapons in 26 peace zones in the first six months of 2017. 
The German and the Yemenite are a perfect team; if a delegate holds the floor for too long or the talks go round in circles, then they take turns to intervene – sometimes with clear statements or a minor provocation, or by announcing a break providing an opportunity for informal talks around the coffee table in the corridor. 
Saif tries to get those no longer taking part in discussions on board again. 
According to the United Nations, Yemenites are suffering a worsening famine and one of the world’s biggest humanitarian crises. 
“We cannot stop the war right now with these unofficial peace talks, but they can limit acts of aggression and ensure that there are any lines of communication at all”, he added. 
These decisions aren’t easy as the civil war in Yemen is highly complicated. It is a combination of trouble spots that have been simmering away for a long time, conflicts stirred up by the Arab Spring, in a state that had always been weak, and neighbouring countries intervening as they believe that their own security interests are under threat. 
In July 2017, the UN Security Council authorised a follow-up mission whose main task will be to verify the implementation of those chapters of the peace treaty that seek to reincorporate former FARC fighters in political, economic and social terms. 
Relations between the EU and Belarus have become significantly closer as a result.

A more peaceful future dawns 
Disarmament begins 
Disarmament: 
President Santos and Governor Guerra at a ceremony to hand over FARC’s last weapons in La Guajira 
We seem to be confronted with a phase of political hurricanes and earthquakes. 
And the tone of the confrontations seems to get harsher, more intransigent and belligerent from day to day and from speech to speech. 
A change of direction which will bring about more peace, more stability, less hunger and poverty and better prospects for everyone in the world. 
How do we ensure that globalisation finally delivers justice for all, not riches to the few? 
One answer as to how we achieve this change in direction can be found in a report to the United Nations Secretary-General. 
However, the bitter thing about this quote is that it does not come from a current report to the UN Secretary-General. 
This apt analysis of the global situation can be found in a report commissioned for the United Nations almost forty years ago to the day. 
It was in the report of the International North-South Commission, which began its work forty years ago in 1977. 
The Chairman of the Commission was the former German Chancellor Willy Brandt. 
Essentially, humanity is still faced with more or less the same structural difficulties today – but it seems to have become rather more difficult to change the world for the better. 
Looking around the world today, it seems that a world view which puts one's own national interests first and is no longer engaged in a balancing of interests between the nations and countries of this world is gaining ever more ground. 
National egoism is worthless as a regulatory principle for our world! 
For this world view describes the world as an arena, a kind of battleground, in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert their own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience. 
In this world view, the law of the strongest prevails, not the strength of international law. 
The next Eastern Partnership summit will take place in Brussels on 24 November 2017. 
The aim is to intensify the key areas defined in Riga, that is, good governance, market opportunities, mobility/people-to-people contacts and interconnections. 
I am convinced that we have to resolutely rise against this world view. 
We need more international cooperation and less national egoism, not the other way round. 
Further key issues include implementation of the agreed reforms by the partner countries, improvement of the partner countries’ resilience and better communication in the Eastern Partnership. 
Some forty years ago, the North-South Commission recognised that 
global problems cannot be resolved through confrontation but only through often arduous efforts to identify common interests. 
Ultimately, no country, no nation will gain if it only strives to assert its own interests. 
The partner countries have also set up national civil society platforms. 
For if everyone were to do that, confrontations and conflicts would increase and prosperity would decrease. 
The motto “Our country first” not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity. 
In the end, there will only be losers. 
Our historical experience as Germans is very different: 
only after we learned following two terrible world wars to see our former enemies as neighbours and partners with whom we want to shoulder responsibility for a peaceful coexistence, only since then, do our own citizens in Germany have a better life. 
We have learned that it was not “Germany first” that made our country strong and prosperous. Rather, it was only “European and international responsibility first” that gave us Germans peace and prosperity. 
In international cooperation, no-one loses sovereignty. Rather we all gain new sovereignty which we no longer have as nation-states on our own in today’s world. 
That is why the European Union today provides the framework for our German policies. 
The road was often stony and arduous. 
For nothing is more difficult than turning former enemies into friends. 
Often the road is not popular and one needs considerable political courage. 
However, this courage has finally created peace in Europe after centuries of war. 
((Grafik: Landkarte)) 
And it has transformed us – the former enemies – into new and lasting friends. 
It is precisely due to this experience in Germany and Europe, that we are calling for strong and functioning joint institutions, first and foremost the United Nations. 
How urgently essential it is that we work together to create a safer world is demonstrated by the current irresponsible actions of North Korea, which pose a serious threat to world peace. 
The form of cooperation can vary depending on the partner countries’ interests and ambitions and on how willing they are to undertake reforms. 
Germany and the EU have a particular interest in developments in their immediate neighbourhood. 
Germany welcomes the sanctions adopted by the Security Council and is calling for their swift implementation at European level. What is more we want Europe to go beyond that. 
The settlement of this international crisis is so important because otherwise others will be encouraged to copy North Korea. 
If a country manages to build up a nuclear arsenal while the international community stands by and watches helplessly, then other political leaders will follow this example. 
This will result in completely new nuclear trouble spots in the world, and our children and grandchildren will grow up in a very dangerous world. 
That is why North Korea acquiring nuclear weapons is neither a bilateral nor a regional problem. Rather it is a global challenge which we have to master together. 
It is therefore more important than ever that the international architecture for arms control and disarmament does not crumble. 
What the world needs most urgently is new trust. 
Especially with regard to the implementation of the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have a request for the United States, Russia and China. 
These countries will be instrumental in ensuring that the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as arms control and disarmament are implemented. 
To this end, the trust among them must be restored. 
The Eastern Partnership countries: Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan (in orange) 
The Eastern Partnership promotes a reform course by the partner governments and offers EU support that gives additional impetus to their political, economic and social transformation. 
In 2014, the EU signed Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. 
Speeches by Presidents of the United States are always important and interesting. 
It is always worthwhile listening to them or even reading them. 
I found a quote in one of these speeches which I especially liked. 
In this speech, the American President called for “general and complete disarmament”. 
Every year, he said, billions of dollars were spent on weapons that are “acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them”. 
The speech was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963. 
You can see, everything we need for a safer future has already been thought, written and said. 
At multilateral level, four thematic platforms and a large number of programmes and projects associated with them address topics of mutual interest to all partner countries, thus facilitating the exchange of experiences and cooperation between them. 
I believe we should focus today on the bold visions of the North-South Commission and that of John F. Kennedy and have the courage to put forward new offers on disarmament, arms control and confidence-building. 
One of our tasks is to resolve emerging crises early on. 
One recent example of this is the escalation of violence against the Rohingyas and the flows of refugees in the region. 
Germany will again increase its aid for the Rohingyas via the International Red Cross. 
Germany is committed to providing political and humanitarian support, as well as to practical peace building, in many crisis regions around the world. 
Military engagement under the auspices of the United Nations is also sometimes necessary. 
Disarmament of FARC completed 
The report of the North-South Commission included an impressive finding: the military expenditure of only half a day would have sufficed to finance the whole malaria eradication programme at that time. 
We currently spend just under 1.7 trillion US dollars each year on arms around the world. 
We Germans have therefore tripled our funding for civilian peacekeeping measures during the last few years. 
Weapons deactivated by experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief 
However, progress has also been made. 
We have to quickly consolidate the successes which have been achieved there in the fight against the so-called Islamic State by initiating reconstruction and stabilisation measures in the liberated cities and regions. 
For we cannot abandon the victims of the IS thugs. What is more, we have to make it possible for them to return home! 
In cases of severe deviations, visa requirements can be reintroduced. 
We can only ask the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq not to trigger any new conflicts. 
For new conflicts are the very last thing that this country needs. 
We also have to make progress in the Ukraine conflict. 
Volunteer experts from the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief are playing a key role in this strategy. 
The UN secured weapons belonging to former FARC fighters from 998 secret locations. 
If proposals are now put forward on deploying a UN peace mission, then I think we should pursue this idea resolutely. 
Certainly there is not yet sufficient consensus on what this peace mission should look like. 
However, it is worth the effort to try this idea out and we ask the UN Secretary-General to press for this proposal to be realised. 
In the agreement reached, the ELN agreed to refrain from kidnappings and attacks until 2018 and expressed its willingness to enter into negotiations with the Government. 
Colombia is experiencing the dawn of a peaceful age which Germany is continuing to lend its active support. 
Only a world in which solidarity prevails will ultimately bring us security and stability. 
More than fifty years after the bloody conflict between rebels and government forces broke out, claiming over 220,000 lives and displacing millions within the country, the United Nations (UN) will officially end the mission to disarm the FARC rebels on 25 September 2017 – just ten months after the peace agreement was signed. 
The UN will also support these efforts. 
If we want to realise major ambitions such as peace, security and justice, we need strong joint institutions, particularly the United Nations. 
For that very reason, they bequeathed to us the UN Charter with its timeless principles and maxims. 
On the contrary, the United Nations will probably need more funding. 
We have to provide the United Nations with the means it needs to fulfil its mandate. 
The World Development Programme receives a mere 15% of its contributions as voluntary, non tied payments today, in 2011 it was still 50%. 
And things do not look any better with respect to other UN aid programmes. 
It cannot be that those in positions of responsibility at the United Nations spend more time distributing begging letters to find the necessary funding than in organising effective assistance. 
We have to grant the United Nations the right level of funding as well as more freedom. 
In return, we need more efficiency and transparency with regard to how the funding is used. 
As the fourth biggest provider of assessed contributions and far beyond that, for example as one of the biggest donors of humanitarian assistance around the world, we want to continue making a substantial input. 
The composition of the Security Council should reflect the realities of today’s world. 
For today, more states than at the time of the establishment of the United Nations over 70 years ago are shouldering responsibility for peace and security – and are prepared to live up to this responsibility in the United Nations. 
That is why my country is seeking a seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. 
We do so with a clear compass – peace and security, global justice and human rights are indivisibly linked. 
For we can only resolve the global problems if we reach a fair and peaceful balance of interests among all nations. 
For, as Willy Brandt, who headed the North-South Commission after leaving office as Chancellor, once said: 
Speech by Foreign Minister Gabriel at the 72nd session of UN General Assembly in New York 
Projects currently under way cover a broad spectrum, ranging from disaster prevention to support for small and medium-sized enterprises and internet-based school partnerships. 
From the start of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2003, Russia decided not to be part of this policy, but rather to shape its relations with the EU on its own basis. 
This automatically meant that it did not become part of the Eastern Partnership. 
During this period, the UN mission in Colombia, as a neutral actor in the tripartite mechanism, ensured that both sides kept to the agreements reached and actively supported the laying down of arms. 
Although the Eastern Partnership is fundamentally open to cooperation with third countries, Russia took an increasingly critical view of it. 
It oversaw the registration, identification, storage and constant monitoring of weapons and munition, and developed a strategy for destroying ordnance. 
At the end of July, Germany immediately provided the Agency with 300,000 euros to deactivate the weapons following an appeal from the United Nations. 
Since the summer of 2013, Russian pressure on the eastern partners to abandon association agreements with the EU and the implementation of the corresponding Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas has cast a shadow over the situation in the neighbourhood shared with Russia. 
The Federal Government has supported the peace process as such with more than 30 million euros in direct project work as well as with extensive loans since 2016 alone. 
The FARC movement intends to contribute peacefully to Colombia’s political process as a political party in the future. 
Moreover, in a surprising development, the guerilla organisation ELN agreed to a ceasefire with the Colombian Government during the visit by Pope Francis. 
UN vehicles outside the demobilisation zone in Conejo 
In response to pressure from Russia, the Ukrainian Government refused to sign the Association Agreement, which had been finalised in 2012, in the immediate run-up to the Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius in 2013, thus sparking protests against the Government in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine and ultimately leading to its removal. 
In addition to the ongoing support measures, the Federal Government will assist this reincorporation process by contributing a further one million euros to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. 
Only the arms embargo and asset restrictions/travel bans on four people with links to as yet unresolved disappearances are still in force. 
These sanctions are currently due to expire on 28 February 2018. 
When the sanctions were recently extended, biathlon weapons and ammunition were excluded from the arms embargo. 
Yet, ladies and gentlemen, 
During the lunch break, he and his team sorted all of the points that the delegates from the various parties to the conflict mentioned in the morning into thematic groups. 
But, first and foremost, they have teamed up with Yemen’s former President Ali Abdallah Saleh – a Sunni who was ousted from office during the Arab Spring. 
In Saudi Arabia’s view, this meant that the arch enemy Iran was, indirectly, calling the shots in Yemen – an unacceptable state of affairs for Riyadh, which considers itself to be the guardian of the Sunnis. 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states decided to back President Hadi. 
A regular dialogue on trade was also launched in 2016. Belarus hopes that this dialogue will lead to diversification in its foreign trade. 
These summits are the forum for steering the political process. 
Following the founding summit in Prague in 2009, the second summit, which was held in Warsaw on 29 and 30 September 2011, primarily concentrated on how to take the Eastern Partnership forward. 
Lithuania hosted the third Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius on 28 and 29 November 2013, at which the association agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine were initialled. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel addressing the General Assembly

In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for global disarmament and warned about “national egoism”. 
Conflict with North Korea shows that cooperation is vital 
The agreement is a way out of the impasse of a nuclear confrontation which would jeopardise regional security and have an impact far beyond the region. 
This, he went on to say, was certainly not “the most efficient means of assuring peace”. 
The nuclear dispute with North Korea made it drastically clear that the current conflicts in the world make multilateral cooperation more vital than ever. 
“It cannot be that striving to build up a nuclear arsenal leads to success on the international stage,” Gabriel said. 
At the same time, diplomatic means must be sought to defuse the situation and prevent further escalation in the future. 
Stopping nuclear armament 
In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations, i.e. to eradicate extreme poverty in the world by 2030, we would need only ten percent of that.” 
“This is not only about Iran. This is about the credibility of the international community,” Gabriel said. 
Security Council reform needed 
Gabriel focused on the need for Security Council reform, which many countries are demanding. 
Under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU thus promotes political and socio-economic reforms in its neighbouring countries aimed at strengthening stability, democracy and prosperity. It also fosters closer political, economic and people-to-people relations between these countries and the EU and relations among the countries themselves. 
The Eastern Partnership was set up specifically for the EU’s eastern neighbours (Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan) at a summit in Prague on 7 May 2009. Since then, it has formed the foundation for the partner countries’ bilateral relations with the EU, as well as for the multilateral relations between the EU and its 28 Member States and the six partner countries. 
Following the historic changes in the former Soviet Union, the Eastern Partnership provides an opportunity to support the EU’s eastern partners on the basis of shared values on their path to becoming democratic societies based on the rule of law and the market economy. 
Association agreements have been signed at bilateral level with partner countries Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, while a deeper partnership agreement has been concluded with Armenia. The latter was initialled on 21 March 2017, but has not yet been signed. 
It fundamentally offers the conclusion of comprehensive association agreements with the EU that also include the establishment of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTA). 
As regards the countries that do not aim for EU association, the EU is endeavouring to intensify its bilateral relations and put them on a new footing. 
To this end, the current and partly outdated Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCA) with the partner countries are to be replaced by extended framework agreements. 
The negotiations with Armenia on a new framework agreement were concluded on 27 February 2017, and the agreement was initialled on 21 March 2017. 
Talks on the same type of framework agreement began with Azerbaijan in early February 2017. 
This project-related cooperation focuses primarily on the following areas: (1) democracy and good governance; (2) economic integration and convergence; (3) energy security and (4) people-to-people contacts. 
The Ukrainian interim government decided to sign the political section of the Association Agreement with the EU on 21 March 2014 and the trade section on 27 June 2014. 
At the summit in Riga on 21 and 22 May 2015, all participants underlined their commitment to the Eastern Partnership and to intensifying relations, particularly in view of the Ukraine crisis. 
In addition to the summits, meetings of the Eastern Partnership Foreign Ministers are held annually. Their most recent meeting took place in Luxembourg on 19 June 2017. There is also regular direct exchange between other ministries, such as the Eastern Partnership Environment Ministers meeting. 
Further forums took place in Poznań (Poland) in 2011, Stockholm (Sweden) in 2012, Chisinau (Republic of Moldova) in 2013, Tbilisi (Georgia) in 2014, Kyiv (Ukraine) in 2015 and Brussels (Belgium) in 2016. 
The next forum will be held in Tallinn (Estonia) in October 2017. 
That is why visa liberalisation is one of the Eastern Partnership’s long-term goals. 
In a gradual process, the EU is helping its partners to create the necessary conditions for safe, well-organised travel. 
How does the Eastern Partnership work? 
Who steers the Eastern Partnership? 
Meetings of Eastern Partnership Heads of State and Government take place every two years. 
Among other things, it agreed on enhanced cooperation in the economic and trade spheres. 
The German Government is particularly keen for civil society in the partner countries to receive continued support and develop closer links with NGOs in the EU. 
Gabriel promised that Germany will continue championing reform. 
“The motto ‘Our country first’ not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity. In the end, there will only be losers,” he said. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel referred to German history in his speech, saying that Germany only became strong and prosperous after it learned to see its former enemies as neighbours and partners following two terrible world wars. 
The Foreign Minister underlined that the international community must stand together and implement the sanctions agreed by the Security Council swiftly and completely in order to de-escalate the nuclear dispute with North Korea. 
Gabriel had a packed schedule in New York 
With regard to the control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the General Assembly dealt with a further problem, namely 
which he said was working and had been effective in preventing a dangerous escalation in the region. 
Failure of the agreement would also send a fatal message for mediation initiatives in other conflicts. 
The enormous sums of money invested in armament worldwide could be used far more intelligently to help resolve problems on a permanent basis if a mere fraction of these sums were used for development aid. 
Further key topics in the Foreign Minister’s speech addressed Germany’s role in humanitarian assistance and the reforms needed in the United Nations system. 
The Security Council reflects the balance of power of the world around 1945 and not of today. 
In his speech, Gabriel made an urgent appeal not to jeopardise the diplomatic success of the agreement, 
However, Armenia continued to show interest in more intensive cooperation with the EU and started negotiations again in 2015. 
Although a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement was initialled on 21 March 2017, 
Since the end of February 2016, the EU has lifted most of the sanctions it had imposed in 2010 against members of the Belarusian regime who were responsible for repression at the time of the presidential election that year. 
Since April 2016, there have been biannual meetings of the informal EU-Belarus Coordination Group that facilitate exchange on a wide range of topics, including human rights. 
The participation of Belarusian civil society representatives in this exchange is of particular importance. 
The country is also showing interest in a framework agreement with the EU like those agreed with the other members of the Eastern Partnership. 
At the same time, the principle of differentiation was underlined. This means that relations are tailored to the various partner countries. 
The European External Action Service and the European Commission have defined aims for each of these four areas to be achieved by 2020. 
The Eastern Partnership’s Civil Society Forum meets annually and is closely involved in the work of the four multilateral platforms. 
Speech by Gabriel to the UN General Assembly: cooperation rather than rearmament 
In his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday (21 September), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for a comprehensive disarmament initiative and more international cooperation. 
“We currently spend just under 1.7 trillion dollars each year on arms around the world. 
the growing concern that the United States might turn its back on the nuclear agreement with Iran following US President Trump’s harsh criticism of the deal at the beginning of the week. 
Crisis management – North Korea and eastern Ukraine high on the agenda

Furthermore, the international community assembled in New York looked at ways to resolve the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the nuclear agreement with Iran 
“It is in our utmost interest not to jeopardise the agreement with Iran” 
Following intensive discussions with his counterparts from France, Britain, the United States, Russia, China and the EU, Foreign Minister Gabriel warned against taking a major step back: 
Concern about the agreement 
After President Trump sharply criticised Iran, there is growing concern that the United States could turn its back on the nuclear agreement with Tehran. 
“It is in our utmost interest not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement with Iran and certainly not to end it now or in the future”, stated the German Foreign Minister. 
He went on to say that the last two years had shown that the agreement was working and that it had prevented a dangerous nuclear proliferation in the region. 
Everyone, including the Iranians, had adhered to the obligations arising from the agreement, stressed the German Foreign Minister in New York. 
“The International Atomic Energy Agency’s monitoring mechanisms are effective.” 
Gabriel added that the US Administration was right to say that Iran was still not playing a constructive role in the trouble spots in the Middle East. 
He made it clear that this had to be discussed, “but not by means of a working regional nuclear arms control agreement.” 
The future of the agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme is at the top of the agenda of ministerial week at the United Nations in New York. 
Alongside the agreement with Iran, the issue of a possible peace mission in eastern Ukraine to implement a ceasefire in the region also played a prominent role during ministerial week at the United Nations. 
he said that terminating the agreement would pose a threat to peace in an already volatile region. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel discussed this with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin.

Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the referendum in the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq 
We are aware that it was important to many Kurds to take part in the referendum. 
Outstanding questions between Erbil and Baghdad must be discussed and resolved through dialogue. 
It cannot be in anyone’s interest to jeopardise the progress that has been achieved at such a high cost. 
The joint fight against IS under the international coalition must continue to be the main priority. 
All neighbouring countries must help in this endeavour. 
The Region of Kurdistan-Iraq would be well advised to restore the legitimacy of its institutions through elections on 1 November, as announced.” 
“It is unfortunate that the Government and President of the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq adhered to the plans to organise a referendum on independence. 
They made this decision without considering reservations and warnings and against the unanimous advice of the international community. 
At the same time, we are gravely concerned that this step could further aggravate the unstable regional situation, which has become incomparably more difficult since yesterday. 
We reiterate our calls on all sides to avoid any form of escalation and to refrain from taking unilateral steps towards independence or coercive measures. 
We expect the Kurdistan Regional Government and the Iraqi Government to exert a moderating influence on the local stakeholders. 
The IHRA’s definition is as follows: 
The outcome of the referendum is not binding, particularly as regards designating the contested territories as being part of the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq.

The attacker was shot dead. 
Federal Foreign Office on the attack on the Har Adar settlement 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (26 September) on the referendum held yesterday in the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq and in parts of northern Iraq contested between Baghdad and Erbil: 
Once again, a cowardly attack has reminded us how far the Middle East conflict still is from a peaceful settlement. 
We expect everyone in a position of responsibility on the Palestinian side to state clearly and unambiguously that they do not condone violence. 
Otherwise, there is a danger that the efforts to resume negotiations will fail. 
It is especially important in the light of the forthcoming Jewish holiday that all sides actively seek to de-escalate the situation. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (26 September) concerning the attack on the Har Adar settlement this morning, in which three Israelis – one police officer and two security guards – were killed and at least one man was injured: 
On Tuesday morning, a Palestinian fired shots at Israeli border police officers and guards from a private security company posted at the rear entrance of the Jewish settlement of Har Adar. The settlement is situated east of the Green Line in the occupied West Bank but west of the fence put up by Israel. 
It can therefore help to identify and analyse the various facets of anti‑Semitism. 
On Sunday (24 September), election observers from the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE) were in Germany to keep a close eye on the general election. 
An upside‑down world? 
The mission comprised 56 participants, including 43 parliamentarians from 25 OSCE participating States, 
The three experts are in Germany from 11 to 28 September 
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly members in Germany for the first time as election observers 
Moreover, from 22 to 25 September, OSCE Parliamentary Assembly members visited Germany for the first time as election observers. 
and will speak with interlocutors from ministries, the public authorities, the Federal Constitutional Court, political parties and civil society. 
Over the past 25 years, the OSCE has taken a close look at over 300 elections in its 57 participating States. 
Election observation is a routine also in those participating States with an established democracy. 
The OSCE deployed three experts to observe the German general election: team leader Caetana de Zulueta from Italy; Marianna Skopa, a legal/political analyst from Greece; and Dragan Zelić, a campaign finance expert from Croatia. 
The OSCE deployed observers to a German general election for the first time in 2009. 
Its work is supported by the Permanent Office, which is headquartered in Berlin. 
The IHRA Chairmanship rotates annually. Romania held the Chairmanship in 2016 and Switzerland is the current Chair. Italy is set to assume the Chairmanship in 2018. 
Germany was a co‑initiator of the definition. 
Germany is the fifth IHRA member to endorse this definition politically at the national level after the UK, Romania, Israel and Austria. 
Moreover, by including this last sentence on countering anti‑Semitism with respect to Israel, the Federal Government goes beyond the definition agreed by the IHRA. 
International working definition of anti‑Semitism supported by the Federal Government 
“Anti‑Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti‑Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non‑Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. 
Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.” 
The adoption of this working definition at the Plenary Meeting of the 31 member countries of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in May 2016 had its origins in a German-Romanian initiative. 
A strong symbol – against all forms of anti‑Semitism 
Due to its historical responsibility, Germany strives with firm resolve to counter all forms of anti‑Semitism. 
The Federal Foreign Office held a conference on this topic on Tuesday (29 September).

Iraq, Colombia, Syria, Afghanistan – there is a need for action in many conflict regions 
Only with joint solutions can we rekindle enthusiasm among the people of Europe for the EU. 
He can count on our support. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (26 September) on President Emmanuel Macron’s Europe speech: 
Overview of humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance 
Today, Emmanuel Macron made a bold and passionate case against nationalism and for Europe – a Europe that, with our help, he wants to reform, strengthen and unite. 
in a turbulent and disorderly world, we must act in concert if we want to continue to make our voice heard and defend our values and principles. 
Supporting people who have been injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance was thus a further key topic at the conference in Bonn. 
That is why Germany is working as a matter of priority for a global prohibition of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions and supporting measures around the world in the field of humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance. 
migration policy, management of our external borders, foreign and security policy, growth and employment, strengthening the eurozone and joint climate policy. 
I, too, firmly believe that, 
Simple awareness that we need European solutions will not be enough. We also need joint European commitment, so that we can resolve these issues together. 
he has the commitment it will take to get this done. 
The challenge after the fight – working together for a world free of landmines 
The Federal Foreign Office is helping to clear landmines in Iraq 
Looking after landmine victims is one of the tasks of the organisations we support 
And even in places where IS has retreated, it is often not possible for people to return home, as the risk of being injured or killed by a landmine is too high. 
Today, Emmanuel Macron demonstrated that 
Emmanuel Macron has identified the key issues for which Europe needs to find more convincing, common answers – because national solutions have for some time now simply not been sufficient: 
The measures funded by Germany help in particular to protect the local population, to enable internally displaced persons to return home safely and to live in dignity, to create access for humanitarian agencies and to support partner countries in implementing their obligations. 
The German Government is one of the largest international donors in the field of humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance. 
In 2016, Germany provided 18 million euros to fund projects in 13 countries and regions. 
The aim is to work with the affected countries and other donor countries to create a world free of landmines and unexploded ordnance. 
Germany is working towards a world free of landmines 
We condemn in the strongest possible terms today’s attack on Israeli police officers and security guards at an entrance to the Jewish settlement Har Adar in the occupied West Bank. 
We convey our heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families and we wish the man injured a speedy and full recovery. 
Anti‑Semitism has no place – neither in Germany, nor in other parts of the world. 
In particular, this working definition is intended to be a role model for educational programmes for both adults and young people as well as children. 
Germany is also working to ensure that other international organisations and bodies engage with this definition – as was the case during Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship last year, for example. 
The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) was founded in 2000 as an international organisation seeking to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and promoting Holocaust education around the world. 
The IHRA has 31 member countries, ten observer countries and seven Permanent International Partners. 
A common international understanding is a prerequisite for fighting anti‑Semitism effectively. 
This was the unequivocal message sent by the Federal Government when it decided to endorse the international definition of anti‑Semitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in order to support the fight against this form of discrimination. 
Federal Foreign Minister Gabriel on President Macron’s Europe speech 
We must seize this opportunity and launch Franco-German initiatives, so that, together, we can make Europe more democratic, get EU citizens involved and position ourselves even better to meet future challenges. 
Landmines, unexploded ordnance and booby traps kill or maim thousands of people around the world each year. 
At the Conference on Humanitarian Mine and Ordnance Clearance in Bonn on 26 September, the main question addressed was how to deal with the improvised landmines and booby traps that are now responsible for most landmine victims in the Middle East and Afghanistan in particular. 
The increased use of such explosives, for example by so‑called “Islamic State” (IS) in Syria and Iraq, has contaminated huge areas of land in recent years. 
An additional 15 million euros were spent on mine and booby trap clearance in Iraq, as part of stabilisation measures. 
Press release: 
“With the death of Shimon Peres, the world lost a great statesman. 
It is vital to preserve this gift, not only here and now, but also at all times in the future. 
It was important to Foreign Minister Gabriel to continue this initiative. 
The Foreign Minister will award the first prizes in person on 10 October. 
I was profoundly moved by the speech Shimon Peres gave as President to the German Bundestag in 2010. 
The prize, which is being awarded for the first time this year in cooperation with the German-Israeli Future Forum, pays tribute to young people in Germany and Israel who work to foster the future of our unique relations. 
The fact that unique and wide-ranging relations between Israel and Germany are possible after the crime against humanity of the Shoah and that we now have a large Jewish community in Germany again is a miracle for which I am grateful. 
That must be beyond a doubt, especially in times like these. 
We will give no quarter to xenophobia, anti-Semitism and marginalisation in Germany. 
During his term as Foreign Minister, Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier launched an initiative to establish a Shimon Peres Prize, with the aim of paying tribute to Shimon Peres’ lasting importance for German-Israeli relations and regional and global peace initiatives. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (28 September) on the first anniversary of the death of Shimon Peres: 
Former Israeli President Shimon Peres died on 28 September 2016. 
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate did sterling work to foster German-Israeli relations. 
On the first anniversary of Shimon Peres’ death, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said: 
“Germany mourns the loss of a close friend who worked throughout his life for reconciliation and understanding, thus making him a role model for generations of people.”

In a speech to the German Bundestag in 2010, Shimon Peres said: 
“He wove the strands of the past and the future together in his unique way, primarily focusing on young people.” 
No quarter for anti-Semitism or xenophobia 
“It is vital to preserve this gift, not only here and now, but also at all times in the future. 
That must be beyond a doubt, especially in times like these. 
We will give no quarter to xenophobia, anti-Semitism and marginalisation in Germany,” Gabriel said.

A vivid memory of Peres’ speech to the German Bundestag 
Gabriel said he had been profoundly moved by Peres’ speech to the German Bundestag. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said the fact that unique and wide-ranging relations between Israel and Germany were possible after the crime against humanity of the Shoah and that there was now a large Jewish community in Germany again was a miracle for which he was grateful. 
The Shimon Peres Prize honours young people’s dedication 
It was a matter of personal importance to Foreign Minister Gabriel to continue this initiative. 
The prize pays tribute to young people in Germany and Israel who work to foster the future of the unique relations between Germans and Israelis. 
Strategic communication

The programme is geared towards young Egyptian attachés and is intended to give them comprehensive insights into Germany’s political, economic, civil society and cultural structures while deepening their understanding of democracy and social pluralism. 
North Korea would be well advised to take seriously this offer of talks. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel has been calling for direct talks with North Korea for several weeks. 
Given the threat of renewed conflict with Iran, both Foreign Minister Gabriel and Chancellor Merkel had, over the past few days, tried to convince the United States of the need for the nuclear agreement. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomes the United States’ offer to engage in direct talks with North Korea on nuclear disarmament and de‑escalation 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomes the United States’ offer to engage in direct talks with North Korea on nuclear disarmament and de‑escalation (1 October 2017). 
This is exactly the right approach and constitutes a major and courageous step by the United States. 
I would now also greatly welcome a similar offer for Iran. 
A move by the United States to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Iran would undermine the credibility of the offer extended to North Korea. 
Diplomacy is the only viable way to find a peaceful solution to the conflict and prevent nuclear armament in the Pacific region. 
Germany – together with Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland – welcomes that today (1 October) the agreement on a bilateral temporary ceasefire between the Government of Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN) will enter into force. 
GPAAC calls on both parties to strictly comply with its terms, thus confirming their willingness to reach full and lasting peace in Colombia. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson on the ceasefire between the Government of Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN) 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson today (1 October) issued the following statement on the ceasefire between the Government of Colombia and the ELN: 
We, the five members of the Group of Countries for the Support, Accompaniment and Cooperation of the Negotiating Table (GPAAC) in Quito, congratulate the negotiating teams for this important achievement and we expect the ceasefire to improve especially the humanitarian situation of the civilian population. 
For the regions of Colombia most affected by armed violence the ceasefire provides the opportunity to engage their societies in the peace process. 
GPAAC welcomes the support of the United Nations and the Catholic Church for the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. 
As GPAAC members, we confirm our readiness to further support and accompany the peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and the ELN. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in Spain 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (2 October) on the situation in Spain: 
I wish those who have been injured a speedy recovery. 
I therefore urge the two sides to enter into talks to find a viable political solution. 
The rule of law is one of the EU’s fundamental pillars. 
That is in the best interest of Spain and its citizens. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the shooting in Las Vegas 
The images that reached us from Spain yesterday show how important it is to end the spiral of escalation now. 
It is vital now to remain calm and to act within the limits of the rule of law and the Spanish Constitution. 
This principle unites us, with Spain in our midst. 
What is more, our countries are also bound by many personal friendships thanks to the many Spanish people in Germany as well as the many Germans who either live in Spain or frequently visit that country. 
I am shocked by the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas tonight. 
I firmly believe that Spain can only overcome its internal divisions if the two sides agree on a common way forward. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with the dead and injured and with all those who are concerned for their loved ones. 
We do not yet know what motive lies behind this ruthless crime whose brutality and insidiousness shock us deeply. 
The German Embassy in Washington is in close contact with the competent authorities and is working hard to establish whether German citizens are among the victims. 
We therefore have the greatest possible interest in having Spain as a strong partner and EU member state. 
Spain is Germany’s close political partner – bilaterally, in the EU and in NATO. 
Statement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the death of Jalal Talabani 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (3 October) on the death of Jalal Talabani: 
I was saddened to learn of the death of former Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. 
As President, Jalal Talabani rendered his country great service during a difficult period in Iraq’s history. 
I would like to express my profound sympathy to the people of Iraq. 
My thoughts are with Jalal Talabani’s family. 
Germany and Spain have the closest of ties: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (2 October) on the shooting at an open-air festival in Las Vegas, during which, according to police reports, at least 50 concert-goers were killed and more than 200 were injured: 
He had been receiving medical treatment in Germany.

travelling first to Prague, and ultimately to the United States of America. 
In his announcement of this year's prizewinners, Göran Hansson, the Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, described it as a discovery that shook the world. 
Rainer Weiss was born in Berlin and emigrated to the USA as a child to escape the Nazis. 
A scientific milestone 
For a few moments, these waves caused the Earth to reverberate and revealed a side of the Universe which had until then remained unseen. 
Nobel Laureate Rainer Weiss was born in Berlin in 1932, the son of a Jewish doctor. He fled with his family from the Nazi regime, 
Nobel Prize in Physics goes to US scientist with German roots 
This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics goes to the American scientists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for the detection of gravitational waves. 
US researchers Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne have finally proven that they exist, and for this work they have been awarded the highest accolade available to physicists. 
The three researchers made a decisive contribution to the construction of the two LIGO detectors in America, with which gravitational waves were observed for the first time ever two years ago. 
Weiss studied and went on to conduct important research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he is a now a Professor Emeritus. 
His biography and emigration are also symptomatic of the brain drain from Germany triggered by the Nazi regime. 
Actually observing the waves is a sensational breakthrough. 
Thirty years of diplomatic relations between Germany and Albania 
Together with Albanian Ambassador Artur Kuko, I had an opportunity today to look back on thirty years of good diplomatic relations between our two countries in turbulent times. 
The development of the rule of law and the fight against corruption and organised crime are particularly important in this regard. 
Germany and Albania: bilateral relations 
A mark of friendship: 
The Federal Government is committed to the prospect of accession to the EU on the part of Albania and the countries of the Western Balkans. 
Albania can count on the support of its friend and partner Germany as it ventures forth along the road towards membership of the EU. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel described the loan as “a mark of the deep friendship between our two countries.”

Next year, in 2018, Lithuania will be celebrating the centenary of its independence. 
This letter informed Germany of Lithuania’s independence and requested recognition of the new state. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel hands over a key document relating to the independence of Lithuania 
Inspired by the forthcoming centenary, a number of scholars set out to find documents relevant to the establishment of the state of Lithuania. 
Historical artefact on loan for centenary

The two foreign ministers at the official handover 
Following the rediscovery of this document, of such great importance to Lithuania’s independence, the country asked for it to be returned to Lithuania for the centenary celebrations. 
Lithuania 
Foreign Minister Linkevičius expressed his thanks for Gabriel’s support and said this was a great gift to his people. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel congratulated the people of Lithuania on their country’s centenary and drew attention to the close historical ties between the two countries. 
This is a cause for celebration, as is reflected by our excellent bilateral relations in many political, economic and cultural fields. 
The process of moving closer to the EU is and remains the crucial driving force for the continued development of the entire region, and its speed will be determined by the progress made on the necessary reforms. 
Following his meeting with Albanian Ambassador Artur Kuko at the Federal Foreign Office, Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth issued the following statement today (5 October) on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the re‑establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Albania: 
We trust that Albania will now, as a new Government with a clear majority under Prime Minister Rama has been in office since 13 September, continue to pursue these reforms resolutely. 
Today (5 October) in Berlin, Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Lithuanian counterpart Linkevičius signed an agreement on the loan of a document from the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive. 
The document is highly pertinent to the Lithuanian state’s declaration of independence in 1918 and will be displayed in the Lithuanian national museum as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations. 
However, the nation’s history has been tumultuous over the past 100 years, and no physical copy of the declaration of independence has been seen in recent times. 
In March 2017, the Lithuanian academic Professor Mazylis visited the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive to look for documents with a bearing on Lithuanian history from 1917-1918. He found a letter to the German Reich from the Taryba (Lithuania’s first provisional assembly prior to the foundation of the First Republic) dated 16 February 1918. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel made it a personal priority to ensure that an agreement was concluded to permit the historical document to be loaned to Lithuania for the occasion. 
The agreement was signed in Villa Borsig on Lake Tegel, Berlin, at a ceremony attended by Lithuanian and German journalists. 
He also noted that Germany had been one of the first countries to recognise the state of Lithuania. 
Prosecuting war crimes: 
Where do we stand with regard to the investigation and prosecution of war crimes in Syria? 
This issue was the topic under discussion on Friday (6 October) at a symposium with State Secretary Lindner and international experts at the Federal Foreign Office. 
No peace without justice

“Together with ICAN, I am delighted that the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to this organisation. 
Crimes against men, women and children of various faiths and political affiliation are being committed on a daily basis. 
Hundreds of thousands have fled Syria. 
Even though no end to the violence in Syria is currently in sight, 
reconciliation can only succeed if the perpetrators of serious human rights infringements are brought to justice. 
While we are not always of the same opinion regarding the ways in which we can achieve this objective, 
it is clear that 
All important players around one table for the first time 
Tangible progress is urgently needed in order to achieve the objective of a world without nuclear weapons. 
The Federal Government is therefore actively involved in a range of disarmament initiatives. 
State Secretary Lindner expressed his sincere thanks to them for their crucial work and stressed: 
Progress has been made primarily with respect to transparency over the P5’s nuclear arsenals. 
“It is vital that those responsible for these crimes in Syria be brought to justice one day.” 
Major challenges in documenting crimes

The symposium participants described in detail the difficulties and challenges they faced in documenting human rights violations in Syria. 
To date the perpetrators have not had to answer to an international court: 
However, national law enforcement agencies, including the German Federal Public Prosecutor General, are investigating the war crimes committed in Syria. 
Along with all of these organisations, we are committed to disarmament and to a world without nuclear weapons. 
The first judgements have already been passed. 
the world is currently facing a spiral of fresh nuclear rearmament – not only in North Korea, but also here in Europe. 
Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to ICAN demonstrates the Nobel Committee’s keen awareness of this growing danger.” 
In the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), the Federal Government is cooperating with 11 other non-nuclear-weapon states, including Mexico and Chile, in order to advocate progress on nuclear disarmament in a dialogue with the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (P5). 
The NPDI therefore considers itself to be an important bridge-builder between the non-nuclear-weapon states and the P5 and contributes its own positions and papers to all relevant Conferences on Disarmament, including the review cycles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
For many years now people have been repeatedly appalled by the images of the suffering endured by Syria’s civilian population. 
The prize pays tribute to the work done by ICAN and all of the other organisations that are working towards a world free from nuclear weapons. 
Banning the production of fissile materials is an important part of the step-by-step approach pursued by the Federal Government that seeks to ensure effective, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament. 
On 6 October the Federal Foreign Office brought together the most important players around one table in order to facilitate exchange among themselves and with a wider specialist audience and to coordinate on a common approach. 
Germany is involved in efforts to put a robust and credible verification system in place as an essential element of future nuclear disarmament within the framework of the International Partnership for Nuclear Disarmament Verification (IPNDV). 
They explained that documents often had to be smuggled out of the country at great personal risk and victims undergo gentle questioning in the countries to which they had fled from war and crime. 
State Secretary Lindner thanked all participants for their engagement and assured them of Germany’s support with criminal investigations in connection with the conflict in Syria. 
On 21 September 2017, the NPDI met at ministerial level on the fringes of this year’s UN General Assembly at the invitation of Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Japanese counterpart Kono, adopting Joint Statements on both nuclear disarmament and North Korea. 
He said that the event provided an opportunity for all sides to work together to find ways to live up to their responsibility in the fight against impunity in Syria. 
It was with this in mind that the Federal Government hosted a meeting of the IPNDV in Berlin for the first time in March 2017. 
symposium on tackling impunity in Syria 
Despite the diversity of their backgrounds, the numerous governmental und non-governmental organisations are united by one goal: 
to document and analyse war crimes in Syria so that this data can subsequently be used for court proceedings. 
Symposium participants included representatives of the United Nations, non-governmental organisations amd the Federal Public Prosecutor General as well as human rights activists. 
vetoes from Russia and China have prevented the conflict from being referred to the International Criminal Court and blocked the creation of a new special court such as those set up by the UN Security Council following the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
Together with Canada and the Netherlands and with the close involvement of the nuclear-weapon states, the Federal Government has initiated a process that is intended to culminate in negotiations on a ban on the production of fissile materials as part of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT – a “treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices”). 
In contrast to the prohibition treaty, the five nuclear‑weapon states recognised under the NPT – the US, France, the UK, Russia and China – are playing an active role in the process. 
The process closely coordinated by Germany, the Netherlands and Canada intends to identify potential elements of the FMCT treaty as part of a 25‑member high‑level Expert Preparatory Group in Geneva. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (6 October) on the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN): 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the Peter Steudtner case 
This was a difficult but important step demonstrating Ukraine’s commitment to its international obligations and to the implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
The prerequisites for further progress are lasting stabilisation of the security situation and a complete and permanent ceasefire. 
The 2014 special status law would have expired this month (18 October). 
This law is the basis for the special rights of the administrations in certain areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions which are set forth also in the package of measures agreed in Minsk. 
Extending the law was therefore an important step in implementing the Minsk agreements. 
We will continue to do everything in our power to bring the German nationals detained in Turkey, including Peter Steudtner, home to Germany. 
We find the demand that he be sentenced to up to fifteen years imprisonment completely incomprehensible and unacceptable. 
Federal Foreign Office on the Ukrainian parliament’s extension of the special status law 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement on the Ukrainian parliament's extension of the special status law today (6 October): 
The Federal Government commends today’s extension by the Ukrainian parliament of the special status law for the Donbass region. 
I am greatly concerned by the reports on the charges brought by Turkey’s public prosecution office against Peter Steudtner and ten other human rights activists accusing them of “membership of an armed terrorist organisation”. 
Naturally, we immediately contacted the Turkish Government about this matter, for in Turkey, as in any other country, it is a court and not the public prosecution office which ultimately makes such a decision. 
Evidently, the public prosecution office is determined to pursue the allegations against Peter Steudtner, which the German Government cannot understand at all. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel commented as follows today (8 October) on the recent media reports from Turkey concerning the prison sentences for human rights activists for which the public prosecution office is calling: 
Nobel Peace Prize for the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)

“The prize pays tribute to the work done by ICAN and all of the other organisations that are working towards a world free from nuclear weapons”, said Gabriel. 
Growing danger posed by nuclear weapons 
Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to ICAN demonstrated the Nobel Committee’s keen awareness of the growing danger posed by nuclear weapons, he added. 
He said that the world was currently facing a spiral of fresh nuclear rearmament not only in North Korea, but also in Europe. 
The Federal Government is therefore involved in a range of disarmament initiatives. 
The Federal Government is committed to disarmament 
For example, Germany is cooperating with 11 other non-nuclear-weapon states, including Mexico and Chile, in the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) in order to advocate progress on nuclear disarmament in a dialogue with the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (P5). 
On 21 September 2017, the NPDI met at ministerial level on the fringes of this year’s UN General Assembly at the invitation of Foreign Minister Gabriel and his Japanese counterpart Kono, adopting Joint Statements on both nuclear disarmament and North Korea. 
Moreover, together with Canada and the Netherlands and with the close involvement of the nuclear-weapon states, the Federal Government has initiated a process that is intended to culminate in negotiations on a ban on the production of fissile materials as part of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT – a “treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices”).

Nuclear disarmament 
Gabriel stated that Germany was also committed to disarmament and to a world without nuclear weapons, despite differences of opinion regarding the ways in which this objective should be achieved. 
Work on negative security assurances in the context of the Non‑Proliferation Treaty as well as long-term efforts to strengthen and continue to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT) as a member of the Group of Friends of the CTBT are further elements of the Federal Government’s step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament. 
Foreign Minister ‎Gabriel on the awarding of the German Book Prize to Robert Menasse 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (10 October) in Berlin on the awarding of the German Book Prize to Robert Menasse: 
Brexit – the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’s withdrawal from the EU 
I most warmly congratulate Robert Menasse on receiving the German Book Prize. I am particularly pleased that the jury has awarded this year’s prize to Robert Menasse, a passionate European who in his novel Die Hauptstadt (The Capital) depicts everyday life in Brussels shrewdly and with great attention to detail. 
Brexit negotiations between the European Commission and the UK 
With over 450 organisations in 100 countries, the global alliance ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, is committed to disarmament, peace and the banning of nuclear weapons.

This ensures that all German and European concerns are taken into account during the negotiations. 
Which objectives is the Federal Government pursuing? 
This aspect is important particularly for businesses, as well as for transnational science and research. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Gabriel on 30 March 2017 
Following its referendum of 23 June 2016, the UK officially triggered its withdrawal from the EU on 29 March 2017. 
The focus of the first phase is on key aspects of Brexit that must be clarified by 2019. These include the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, as well as the rights of UK citizens living in the member states of the EU27. 
Another issue are the UK’s financial obligations to the EU, as well as the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, whose openness is an important achievement of the peace process. 
NEGOTIATIONS until around Oct 2018 EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier conducts negotiations on a withdrawal agreement. 
RATIFICATION by the end of March 2019 EU member states adopt agreement following approval by the European Parliament. 
EU special summit without UK 29 April 2017 Heads of government adopt guidelines for the Brexit talks. 
As soon as the European Council has deemed that sufficient progress has been made on the key aspects of Brexit, the Commission and the UK may then also hold parallel talks on future relations between the EU and the UK. 
“The most important condition in the Brexit negotiations is that they must protect the interests of the citizens of the 27 remaining member states, the member states’ cohesion as well as economic, social and political interests, and the interests of the EU institutions. 
The European Council may grant an extension to the deadline in consultation with the UK only by unanimous agreement. 
The rounds of talks are scheduled to be held on a monthly basis. 
DECLARATION 29 March 2017 The UK officially notifies the European Council of its intention to leave the EU in a letter to the European Council. 
Without an agreement, the UK will leave the EU in a disorderly fashion. 
However, it is important to emphasise that the advantages of EU membership cannot be enjoyed without the obligations it entails. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the situation in Catalonia 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (11 October) on the situation in Catalonia: 
Europe’s strength lies in its unity and the peace which European integration has brought. 
The demonstrations of the last few days have shown that 
Catalonia’s population is divided on the question of independence. 
The truth is that 
A unilateral declaration of Catalan independence would be irresponsible. 
For our shared European experience has taught us that 
a solution can only be found through a dialogue based on the rule of law and within the limits of the Spanish constitution. 
Ultimately, a solution will only be durable if it has the support of the majority of Spaniards and Catalans. 
In accordance with the EU Treaty, the UK’s membership ends automatically on 29 March 2019, if no withdrawal agreement enters into force prior to this deadline. 
The European Council, meeting in an EU27 format (without the UK), set the political parameters for the Brexit negotiations on 29 April 2017. 
The negotiations are being conducted by the European Commission under the political control of the member states and with Michel Barnier as chief negotiator. 
Article 50 of the EU Treaty sets out the procedure 
The European Council must adjust the parameters of the negotiations, which have only applied to the first phase so far, for this second phase. 
Another focus is on averting any damage that Brexit could cause to the European Union at large. 
Relations with the Philippines could be expanded, particularly in view of the potential offered by the Philippine economy. 
Through their diplomatic relations, Germany has had friendly ties with Thailand for more than 150 years. 
Muslims and Buddhists live there, as do Hindus, Christians and adherents of other religions. 
In Laos, too, there are special priorities within German development cooperation, especially in the spheres of rural development, economic integration in ASEAN, as well as climate and environmental protection.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel sees the fact that Germany and Israel have developed such close bilateral relations despite the crimes of the Holocaust as almost a miracle. 
Cooperation with Malaysia, one of the most important trading partners among the ASEAN states, is especially intensive in the economic and technological spheres as well as in academic exchange. 
The first was the Migration Hub Network Berlin-Tel Aviv, which organises exchanges of experts with the aim of creating economic and social integration opportunities for refugees and socially disadvantaged people. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth’s visit to the country in the Caucasus region on 9 and 10 October was entirely in tune with the German-Georgian year: 
as well as holding political talks, meeting human rights activists and taking part in an EUMM patrol on the administrative boundary line between Georgia and South Ossetia, Roth also caught up with some “familiar faces” – the Tutarchela choir. 
A visit to friends

Germany and Georgia have travelled a long road together. 
To this day, Germany’s early recognition of Georgia, back in 1918, is remembered in the capital Tbilisi. 
saying that Germany was a particularly good and reliable partner for Georgia. The Prime Minister also expressed his gratitude for Germany’s support on the issue of visa-free travel to the EU, which has been in force for eight months now. 
After the meeting, Roth said: 
“I have been impressed by Georgia’s development over recent years. 
Georgia’s steps towards the EU 
As a member of the Eastern Partnership, Georgia is seeking to move towards the EU. 
Minister of State Roth had a meeting with Georgian Foreign Minister Mikheil Janelidze and both men agreed that the country should continue resolutely along this path. 
“Everyone knows it is a long road to the EU, but Germany will support this course wherever it can,” Roth said. 
Representatives of non-governmental organisations said that their country had made generally good progress on human rights issues. 
However, they also said that much remained to be done, 
particularly with respect to women’s and children’s rights and in efforts to consistently prevent discrimination against sexual minorities.

With over 200 observers, it is the second-biggest civilian EU mission after the one in Kosovo. 
Another encounter with the Tutarchela choir 
At the end of his trip, Minister of State Roth had the pleasure of seeing some familiar faces: 
he had welcomed the Tutarchela choir when it visited his home town, Bad Hersfeld, in August. Now it was appearing in the residence of German Ambassador Petschaft in Tbilisi, where the audience was just as enthusiastic as the listeners in Germany had been. 
These close relations also serve as an example for the present day “that bitter enemies cannot only become partners, but even friends”. 
Gabriel awarded the Shimon Peres Prize to two such projects on Tuesday evening (10 October).

The fact that the Shimon Peres Prize was awarded to two German-Israeli projects rather than to individuals highlights once again the wide range of joint German-Israeli projects and in particular the large number of projects run by young people. 
The Federal Foreign Office and the German-Israeli Future Forum Foundation awarded the Shimon Peres Prize for the first time, shortly after the first anniversary of Peres’ death. 
This is not something that we should leave unchallenged. 
“Nobody can fall in love with the single market.” 
The French President also made far-reaching proposals on European security and defence policy. 
Respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law keep Europe together and are part of European identity. 
That is why it is important that the European Commission is doing everything in its power to protect European values. 
Europe stands for diversity. 
Debates on different ideas are needed more than ever before. 
For example, the EU’s role in the endeavours to bring about peace in Syria is negligible, although Europe is directly affected by the conflict, particularly by refugee flows. 
The EU must represent and defend these values proactively. 
This requires reforms. 
The decisions that were made without preparation or forethought during the migration crisis of 2015 must not be repeated. 
This agenda should take the following elements as its point of departure: 
Strengthening what keeps us together 
Decision-makers in Europe must be accountable to the public. 
The European Parliament must be legitimised by the European electorate as a whole via transnational lists. 
Conversely, the Commission must be reduced in size and become more political. 
We, too, should not only think in a narrow-minded way of what is feasible in the short term, but instead discuss Europe’s future strategically and in the long term. 
including from Germany. 
Germany needs a courageous and well-coordinated European policy 
The only substantive response to Macron’s speech by Germany have been proposals regarding economic and monetary union. 
Instead of seizing the French proposals as an opportunity for a fresh start, the proposals by the Federal Ministry of Finance sound like an even more heavy-handed approach to European member states in the area of “structural reforms”, whose positive impact is certainly a matter of debate. 
Working together for the rule of law, diversity and tolerance 
South‑East Asia: Opportunities and challenges 
Celebrating ASEAN’s 50th anniversary in Manila in August 2017 
The member states are committed to peaceful conflict resolution and to a rules‑based, multilateral system of international cooperation. 
With the exception of Timor-Leste, Germany has embassies and consulates general in all South‑East Asian countries. There are also German chambers of commerce in some countries. 
The Sultanate of Brunei (Darussalem) is the smallest country in South‑East Asia. 
Indonesia, the world’s largest island state and the most populous country in South‑East Asia, has close relations with Germany and plays a key role in the cooperation with the EU.

Germany has had close relations with the city‑state of Singapore since its establishment in 1965. 
There have been diplomatic relations between Germany and Viet Nam since 1975. 
If this were nothing but a parting shot by the outgoing Minister of Finance, then we would be able to disregard this. 
Like France, Germany should encourage a major debate on the future of Europe. 
Instead, the EU’s trustworthiness and credibility depend on the public being able to feel the benefits of European integration in their daily lives and, most importantly, in difficult situations. 
Instead, Germany should stand shoulder to shoulder with France and support its proposals for a broad European reform agenda. 
The rule of having “the same pay for the same work in the same place” is a long-overdue principle that must be added to the single market regulations that are currently in force. 
We should build far more bridges between our two countries and work together for more democracy, rule of law, tolerance and diversity in Europe.” 
The civilian observers regard themselves first and foremost as mediators between enemy parties, helping to keep up the dialogue, as Minister of State Roth learned while taking part in a patrol along the administrative boundary line with South Ossetia. 
The unarmed EU Monitoring Mission has been in Georgia ever since the 2008 war with Russia in order to monitor observation of the ceasefire agreement at the administrative boundary line between Georgia and the Russian-occupied areas Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
“Germany stands firmly by Georgia's side on the issue of Russia’s illegal violation of Georgian sovereignty,” Roth stated. 
At his meeting with the German Minister of State, Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili emphasised the close friendship and partnership between the two countries,

It must use a common foreign and security policy in order to gradually become an advocate for Europeans’ interests in the world. 
Europe thus needs to stop “punching below its weight” as regards foreign and security policy and to offer the public more. 
All too often, we have been party to sentiments such as “anyone who doesn’t help us to fight youth unemployment shouldn’t be surprised if we don’t help them with the refugee crisis”. 
Europe thus also needs more investments in its internal and external security. 
Those who undertake courageous structural reforms in their own country – such as in France at the present time – must also be given more time to reduce their budget deficits. 
Within the German Government, European policy is not just the purview of the Chancellor and the Federal Minister of Finance – it also falls within the remit of the Federal Foreign Office. 
The proposals on the future of the monetary union made by the outgoing German CDU Federal Minister of Finance have done nothing to change this state of affairs. 
While it was possible to perceive the Chancellor’s initial response to the French proposals for root-and-branch reform of the EU as a fundamental, albeit cautious, expression of support, virtually the opposite is being proposed by the Federal Ministry of Finance. 
To this end, we need balancing mechanisms that do more to foster economic integration between the member states. 
Germany is therefore running the risk of exposing the EU to further erosion and the withdrawal of further countries from European cooperation. 
Member states that demonstrate solidarity and take in refugees should receive more funding from the EU budget in the future. 
However, the Federal Ministry of Finance is wrong to reject the idea of European financial instruments (and in particular of a budget), which could be an important element in stabilisation. 
Instead of proposals for a Europe that offers its citizens more social security, tax equity and greater protection at home and abroad (Macron’s notion of a Europe that protects Europeans), German inaction is the order of the day. 
But the EU and its monetary union have no comparable mechanisms for the investments needed in the continent’s competitiveness, tackling unemployment and deflecting economic shocks. 
Presumably, however, it is a foretaste of the next legislative term, as the CDU and the FDP at any rate are likely to reach agreement swiftly on these issues. 
What is more, he has, as in the past, made far-reaching proposals on reforming the economic and monetary union. 
What Jacques Delors said in the past still holds true: 
That is why Europe needs more tax equity and greater social security in the labour markets. 
Europe will therefore require more, rather than less, investment in its stability, 
The reality is that Germany is, not only in political and economic terms, but above all financially, a beneficiary of the EU. 
Germany has an obligation, more so than every other EU member state, to invest more, not less, in European integration. 
This is in our own interests, 
The EU was founded with internal interests at heart. The aim was to preserve peace on the continent, which had long been dominated by war and destruction, and to create prosperity. 
In the 21st century, however, Europe also needs to redefine itself in the outside world. 
Germany and France have already worked closely together in the past to further the work on joint European capabilities, for example via Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). 
Like the development of a common foreign and security policy, safeguarding the EU’s common borders, combating organised crime and terrorism, and tackling radicalisation and extremism are joint European tasks. 
We need an EU that takes on the major European tasks, while simultaneously allowing its member states room to breathe. 
Unless something can be dealt with better at European level, it remains a national task (subsidiarity). 
To this end, the local level should receive support – not least financially – to enable it to play a greater role politically. 
We want a strong European federation, but not an EU superstate that deals with every last detail. 
In fact, the Treaty envisages the possibility of different rates of integration, for example via the instrument of enhanced cooperation. 
Cohesion and inclusiveness are among the most important prerequisites for the vitality and effectiveness of the EU. 
Each member state’s voice must be heard. 
Franco-German cooperation has a particular role to play here, 
helping to lay the groundwork for European solutions that enhance cohesion. 
The EU must be made fit for the future internally. 
Economic and monetary union does in fact need to be reformed and completed. 
That would send the wrong message for Europe. 
This applies in particular to the field of migration. 
In order for his ideas to become concrete policies, Germany must not only position itself faster, but above all more intelligently and courageously, and help to take steps to achieve Macron’s aims. 
We should be open to the idea of a “refoundation”, which includes member states’ civil societies. 
We cannot exclude treaty reform from the outset. 
However, that is precisely why Emmanuel Macron’s speech, which takes a longer-term view, is so important. 
The European elections in 2019 limit the immediate time frame for fundamental reform, which would require amendments to the treaties. 
We want a safe, prosperous, competitive, sustainable, socially responsible and democratic Union based on the principle of solidarity. 
This requires a strong European spirit and political will, as well as a joint approach by the entire German Government coordinated at the Federal Foreign Office and in consultation with all ministries. 
What once applied to our country must also be granted to our European neighbours. 
In this regard, local authorities all over Europe should be able to apply voluntarily to take in refugees in return for financial incentives. The EU must also see the protection of its external borders for what it actually is – a European task that needs to be resolved and organised by the EU as a whole. 
It is time for the German Government to not only pay lip service to his suggestions, but also to follow up its words with deeds. 
The Federal Ministry of Finance evidently intends to use the interim period until the formation of a new German Government to create faits accomplis. 
On the contrary, they are a depressing reflection of the lack of willingness at the Federal Ministry of Finance right now to invest, in Germany's own best interest, in the idea of European integration as a whole and to remedy the current lack of legitimacy for European action. 
Without holding consultations within the German Government still in office, the Federal Ministry of Finance has submitted proposals on European development to ECOFIN that essentially can only be interpreted as a clear rejection of a new Europe of the kind envisaged by the French President. 
The proposals are at risk of being perceived and criticised as typically German and as an endorsement of financial technocrats. 
Germany is responding to France’s suggestion to found Europe anew with proposals focused on “business as usual” and worse. 
Alternatives to these proposals are therefore very important. 
Germany’s contribution to the discussion on the future of Europe should not be restricted to the monetary union or, focusing in the process on the familiar orthodoxies of German European policy with regard to finance. 
The EU must therefore be put in a position to generate stronger and sustainable growth and to create jobs. 
After all, this is the only way to bring about the necessary convergence of economic conditions between the member states, which is so vital to the future of the EU. 
For this purpose, the EU needs greater financial resources and instruments to support investments. 
At the end of the day, Germany will achieve greater security and be able to get its European partners on board when it agrees to invest more resources in Europe. 
Only then will other member states be prepared to implement further reforms – reforms, to be sure, that are reasonable and do not undermine social security – and comply with the basic rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. 
In order to make this notion palatable to the majority in Germany, it is vitally important for German policy-makers – first and foremost the Federal Ministry of Finance – to do away with a myth that has dominated the political discourse in Germany for far too long, namely that Germany is supposedly a net contributor or the packhorse of the EU, so to speak. 
Those who implement the necessary reforms to the labour market in their own country, for instance to strengthen social partnership, in the tax system, in fighting corruption or in public administration, must be given support from the EU. 
Germany itself was given more time to reduce its public borrowing while carrying out major reforms in the framework of Agenda 2010 programme, as it was spending 20 billion euros on public investments in local authorities at the same time. 
But we also need a solution for the problem of old debts – an issue ignored by the Federal Ministry of Finance. 
Strengthening the ESM and developing it into a European monetary fund is the right approach, provided this fund does not become a technocratic regulatory authority without democratic legitimacy, thus further undermining democracy in Europe. 
Europe has clearly defined instruments for safeguarding financial and monetary stability. 
Creating a Eurogroup budget, as suggested by France, is thus an imperative addition to the instruments for safeguarding the stability of the monetary union. 
The fact that large companies can dodge their obligations to pay tax in Europe, while every employee and small and medium-sized enterprise has to pay significantly higher tax rates, poses just as great a threat to the credibility of the European project as single market regulations that make employees vulnerable. 
It is misleading and harmful to claim, as the Federal Ministry of Finance has done, that this is only possible via intergovernmental cooperation, closing out the European Parliament and European Commission. 
At the same time, we cannot afford to weaken the community institutions by encroaching on their tasks, as the Federal Ministry of Finance is now suggesting with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact. 
Proposals on a budget for the eurozone and the creation of a European finance minister must be discussed openly in Germany instead of deleted from the agenda from the outset. 
Europe’s already problematic penchant for excessive red tape and its lack of democratic legitimacy with regard to political decisions are therefore set to continue or even be exacerbated. 
With its proposals, the Federal Ministry of Finance is even prepared to jeopardise the European Commission’s ability to act. 
And instead of investing in Europe because the German economy, too, will ultimately only be successful when (importing) countries around us are doing well, the spectre of further austerity measures, thinly veiled as “structural reforms”, is being raised. 
Germany was the first state to recognise the newly independent African nation in 1960. 
The exhibition focuses on the main aspects of Germany’s engagement in the peace and stabilisation process in Mali. 
For the next six weeks, it will provide visitors with an overview of German-Malian cooperation in all its many facets. 
The exhibition in the Atrium of the Federal Foreign Office will be open to the public from 18 October to 30 November 2017. 
Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid: 
“The most recent natural disasters show 
that prevention is more important than ever” 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, issued the following statement marking International Day for Disaster Reduction today (13 October): 
We cannot wait until a disaster has happened before we respond. 
The majority of disasters do not come as a surprise. 
We can help in advance to prevent suffering! 
Today's International Day for Disaster Reduction serves as a reminder. 
This is something the international community can only do together. 
After all, natural disasters pay no heed to international borders. 
The ongoing implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 plays an important role here. 
The Agreement identified concrete and verifiable targets to be used to judge our efforts. 
We are helping our humanitarian partners above all to make better use of predictions of imminent disasters to enable them to reduce the risks in advance. 
We are also working intensively to protect people forced to leave their homes due to natural disasters or the impact of climate change. 
In 1989 the United Nations declared 13 October International Day for Disaster Reduction. 
The idea behind this day is to encourage all citizens and governments to get involved in building resilient communities and nations which can withstand disasters. 
The Principles focus in particular on the individual role of the various players and their responsibility in the sphere of humanitarian disaster risk reduction. 
Germany was actively involved in shaping the Agreement. 
It provides clear guidelines on how countries and civil societies around the world can avert the emergence of new disaster risks, strengthen the resilience of populations and institutions to crises and natural disasters, and reduce existing risks – among other things through effective disaster risk reduction and preparedness measures. 
This year's conference is to be held in Berlin on 16 October 2017. 
Germany and Mali have long enjoyed a relationship based on close cooperation. 
In the years and decades that followed, Germany supported Mali through various phases of development, constantly increasing its involvement, especially after 2012. 
We must bring down the number of people affected by such disasters. 
All too often even just in recent weeks, we have heard and read about natural disasters and the human suffering they cause: the hurricanes in the Caribbean, the flooding in Bangladesh, the severe earthquakes in Mexico. 
Of course, we cannot prevent these natural disasters, but we can ease the humanitarian impact on the people affected and help them to prepare better for such eventualities. 
By reducing risks and strengthening resilience in areas which are at risk, we can save lives and alleviate suffering. 
We need to coordinate our efforts to reduce disaster risk better and promote concrete cooperation. 
Germany is one of the countries leading the field here and together with experienced partners is engaged in preventive action in high-risk countries. 
We must continue to do our utmost because disaster risk reduction can prevent human suffering. 
This is a point I will be emphasising once more at this year's national conference on disaster risk reduction on Monday in Berlin and in my meeting with Robert Glasser, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. 
All elements of disaster risk reduction are guided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction adopted in 2015. 
At national level, the annual specialist conference on disaster risk reduction provides the forum for exchanging views on the subject. 
In 2013, the Federal Foreign Office launched the Preparedness Initiative and the Principles of Preparedness were subsequently adopted on 11 June 2013 at the International Preparedness Conference in Berlin. 
Here, it is Germany together with Bangladesh who holds the chair in the Platform on Disaster Displacement. 
Mali and Germany – Partners for Peace and Stability 
“Mali and Germany – Partners for Peace and Stability” is the next exhibition to be staged in the Federal Foreign Office Atrium. It will be officially opened at 6.00 p.m. on 18 October 2017. 
The projects in Mali spotlighted in the exhibition cover a wide variety of areas, ranging from reconciliation to small arms control and cultural preservation. 
Dr Patricia Flor, the Head of the Federal Foreign Office Directorate-General for International Order, the United Nations and Arms Control, will open the exhibition jointly with the Ambassador of the Republic of Mali. 
I want to say that I fully support the Secretary-General’s appeal. 
I welcome Audrey Azoulay’s nomination and wish her much energy and courage to take the steps necessary to reform UNESCO. 
There is no doubt that reform is urgently needed, 
as the recent discussions have shown. 
That is why we have agreed a reform agenda with Audrey Azoulay and assured her of our full support. 
The work of UNESCO‎ is improved by working with a clear compass to ensure that the organisation effectively fulfils its tasks of promoting international cultural exchange and protection of cultural property. 
Humanitarian food assistance is one of the focuses of Germany’s humanitarian aid efforts. 
In 2016, the Federal Foreign Office provided some 553 million euros to projects that address hunger and malnutrition. 
Together with our national and international partners, we are engaged in the fight against hunger. 
Because food security means much more than simply putting enough food on people’s plates. 
Every person should be well fed. 
Today, on World Food Day, we are reminded of this. 
World Food Day is observed on 16 October of every year. 
Since 1979, the United Nations has used this day to remind the world that millions of people around the globe suffer from hunger. 
Its mission, as a specialised agency of the United Nations, includes ensuring food security. 
Every day, thousands of people die from the effects of chronic malnutrition. More than half of these are children under the age of five. 
In an ideal world, hunger should have been ended years ago. 
That is why Germany has for many years been part of the worldwide fight to end hunger. 
It is a sad reality, one that should spur us to decisive action. 
I therefore call on not only the Federal Government, but also the international community, to take effective measures towards fighting global hunger. 
Early this year, severe famine and food crises in South Sudan, Somalia, north-eastern Nigeria and Yemen made dramatic headlines. 20 million lives were reported to be at grave risk. 
Chronic undernourishment and malnutrition have a long-range impact not only on the health of those who are affected, but also on the development of an entire society. 
16 October was chosen because it was on this day in 1945 that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was established. 
The Global Hunger Index, published by Welthungerhilfe (a German non-profit organisation) 
16 October 2017 is World Food Day 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2017: 
Unfortunately, the reality is quite different. The current report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) shows that hunger is a very topical issue. 
Some 815 million people around the world are affected by hunger – this is equivalent to roughly ten times the population of Germany. 
Every day, thousands die from the effects of hunger, especially young children. 
Today, on World Food Day, we all must ask ourselves, 
“How can we ensure that no one will go hungry? 
How can we ensure that all people, especially the world’s children, are well fed? 
What can we do to help end world hunger?” 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomes Audrey Azoulay’s nomination as the new Director‑General of UNESCO 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel today (14 October) issued the following statement following the nomination of French candidate Audrey Azoulay as the new Director‑General of UNESCO: 
In doing so, we want to contribute to the work for global reason which Willy Brandt called for in his speech to UNESCO over 40 years ago. 
This prompted UN Secretary-General Guterres to call on all UN Member States to take urgent action. 
The situation in 51 countries is “serious” or “alarming”. In one country, it is even “extremely alarming”. 
Despite significant advances in the fight against hunger, United Nations figures indicate that nearly 815 million people worldwide still suffer from malnutrition. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the attack in Mogadishu 
On 16 October, Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement following the attack in Mogadishu: 
I am deeply shocked by the news of the attack in Mogadishu and condemn this cowardly and devastating act of violence in the strongest possible terms. 
Our thoughts are with the very many victims and their families. 
Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with Somalia’s people and its Government. 
We will not let up in our efforts to improve the security situation and stabilise the country.

That means that more people in fewer countries are suffering from hunger. 
the Central African Republic, Chad, Sierra Leone, Madagascar and Zambia are top of this sad list. 
In some cases, there are considerable differences within countries. 
Who compiles these figures? 
Economically strong countries such as Germany, or countries where insufficient data is available, for instance Congo, South Sudan or Syria, are not included. 
At what point do we speak of famine? 
A differentiation is made among five phases based on factors such as food prices, harvest yields, average income and the food required by households.

24 hours in the life of the Federal Foreign Office – on Twitter 
On 16 October of every year, the United Nations observes World Food Day – thus spotlighting the millions of people around the world suffering from hunger. 
The Federal Foreign Office is working to help these people and is fighting hunger worldwide. 
That is 38 million more than in 2015. 
After the number of those affected had fallen over a period of ten years – from 947 million in 2003 to 775 million in 2014 – the number began to rise significantly once more. 
At the same time, the Global Hunger Index fell by 27 percent compared to 2000. 
The situation is dramatic in the “four hunger crises” in South Sudan, Somalia, north‑eastern Nigeria and Yemen. 
According to the current Global Hunger Index, the situation in 51 countries is “serious” or “alarming”. In one country, it is even “extremely alarming”. 
The Welthungerhilfe publishes the Global Hunger Index every year, 
Phase 5 – famine – has been reached when 20 percent of households are affected by food insecurity, 30 percent of the population is severely malnourished and two out of every 10,000 people die each day due to malnourishment. 
In the long term, hunger has a dramatic impact on society as a whole – in terms of health, the economy and social structures. 
So far in 2017, this figure already amounts to 633 million euros. 
No-one should be suffering from hunger – Germany has been working to achieve that for many years.

“This is about more than Iran” – Gabriel at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg 
We hope you’ll follow us! 
The monthly meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers on Monday (16 October) focused on the nuclear agreement with Iran (JCPOA). 
Foreign Minister Gabriel made it clear in Luxembourg that Europe stood by the agreement. 
This will include the visa section in Manila, a classroom in Minsk and the desk of the German Ambassador in Washington, DC. 
at the Federal Foreign Office, someone’s always on duty. 
Gabriel had talks on Iran with US Senators on 13 October © Imo/photothek.net 
Grave concern over US policy 
The EU member states are gravely concerned about the decision by the US President to no longer certify Iran’s compliance with its obligations under the agreement. 
The Foreign Minister said he firmly believed that the termination of the agreement would be carefully followed by North Korea. 
If North Korea sees that the only agreement which the world has concluded with a country on the non-development of nuclear weapons is torn up and terminated just a few years later, then 
that will lead to no-one having any faith in such agreements. 
North Korea will then develop its nuclear weapons and the unfortunate thing is that others are likely to follow suit. 
This is about more than Iran. 
Burning the candle at both ends – 
We have offices at more than 200 locations worldwide and more than 11,000 staff whose job it is to represent Germany’s interests abroad. 
During these 24 hours, content for tweets will be sent from all German missions abroad to our headquarters in Berlin, from where it will be posted to the Federal Federal Foreign Office’s Twitter account. 
This is about the global issue of how we deal with agreements intended to protect us from the development of nuclear weapons. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel talking to journalists (file photo) © Imo/photothek.net 
The termination of the deal with Iran would make the negotiations with North Korea on nuclear disarmament much more difficult. 
In reaction to the repeated military provocations by Pyongyang, the Foreign Ministers have decided to tighten the sanctions against North Korea. 
The EU’s relations with Turkey were also discussed during the Foreign Affairs Council. 
“In our view, the negotiations on the customs union cannot be continued until we have re-established sensible relations with Turkey. 
Naturally, this includes the release of detainees who we believe to be completely innocent.” 
The Foreign Ministers also decided on Monday to second up to 35 experts to support the reform of the security sector in Iraq (EUAM Iraq). 
They will be sent to Baghdad during the coming weeks to support state institutions with the civilian aspects of the fight against terrorism, corruption and political instability. 
Federal Police Officer Markus Ritter has been appointed to head the mission. 
With the hashtag #AA24, we’ll share a stream of tweets via our account at twitter.com/auswaertigesamt that will give you insight into a regular day’s work at our 220 missions abroad around the world, as well as at our headquarters in Berlin. 
The wrong signal 
Gabriel stated that accession negotiations were at a standstill anyway and that there was not even agreement at present on a possible modernisation of the customs union. 
This wide selection of snippets will give you a good impression of the exciting and colourful work of the Federal Foreign Office in a global and interconnected world. 
Gabriel had talks on Iran with US Senators on 13 October 
The EU intends to continue pressing the US Congress to maintain the agreement. 
Gabriel said it was hoped it would be possible to convince Congress in talks “that the world will not be any safer if we once again drift into a military crisis in Iran and the neighbouring regions.”

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in Kirkuk 
In this tense situation, we call on all parties to exercise restraint and to engage in direct talks. 
Military actions must be ceased immediately and further escalation avoided. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (17 October) on the situation in Kirkuk and other areas in northern Iraq: 
an escalation weakens all sides and, above all, threatens to destabilise Iraq and the region in the long term. 
The conflict between the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq and the Iraqi Government is giving us the greatest cause for concern. 
There is no reason why anyone should believe that there is a military solution to the tensions in Iraq that have flared up in recent days. 
I made this clear in a telephone call to Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al‑Abadi yesterday. 
All parties have a responsibility to work to facilitate the path back to the negotiating table and to a constructive dialogue in order to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner. 
The joint fight against IS must remain the top priority – what is currently at stake, however, is nothing less than the future of the entire country and the security of the region. 
A constructive role in the region: 
Gabriel meets Omani Foreign Minister 
the situation is becoming increasingly dramatic. 
Gabriel stated that an end to the hostilities was the only way to improve people’s lives. 
Oman’s advice is also needed in other areas of conflict. 
“An escalation in the region weakens all sides and, above all, threatens to destabilise Iraq and the region in the long term. 
We call on all parties to exercise restraint and to engage in direct talks. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his counterpart from Muscat on Tuesday evening (17 October) in order to discuss how these tensions can be resolved. 
Germany has long enjoyed good bilateral relations with the Gulf state. 
They are united by common values in the area of foreign policy. 
“We are guided by the principles of equality, mutual respect and dialogue, and, above all, by the peaceful resolution of conflicts. We are also committed to respecting international law. 
Oman could play an important advisory role here, he said. 
An important source of advice in current crises 
These include the crisis over Qatar, which has yet to be resolved, efforts to preserve the nuclear agreement with Iran and, last but not least, the increasingly complex situation in Iraq. 
The situation in the Middle East is currently difficult in many areas, with hostilities in Iraq, attempts to preserve the nuclear agreement with Iran and the dramatic conflict in Yemen. 
We have common goals with respect to the fight against extremism and terrorism”, Gabriel stated. 
Aid organisations have now recorded hundreds of thousands of suspected cases of cholera and 
Frank discussions on the situation in the vicinity of Kirkuk were high up on the meeting’s agenda. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said he was concerned by military confrontations in the region: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in Catalonia 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 October) on the situation in Catalonia: 
The Catalonian regional government must now finally provide the clarity that is needed and demonstrate that it respects the Spanish constitution. 
There is an air of uncertainty surrounding the citizens and businesses of Catalonia. With every passing day, their uncertainty grows and the situation becomes more difficult. 
At this time, it is in everyone’s interest that a solution be found that is within the bounds of the law. 
The Foreign Ministers are particularly concerned about the humanitarian disaster in Yemen. 
Oman is playing a mediating role in the Persian Gulf. 
Forty‑five years of good relations

Prior to his meeting with Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Gabriel said that the longest-serving Foreign Minister in the Middle East was a good source of advice for the Gulf region. 
“Balancing and constructive” – Gabriel said that Oman was playing an important role in what was currently a difficult situation in the Middle East. 
The two countries have engaged in friendly cooperation since establishing diplomatic relations 45 years ago.

Germany is contributing 125 million euros for humanitarian assistance this year. 
“And this is why we are calling on all sides to ensure a lasting ceasefire, as well as guarantee access for humanitarian assistance in order to alleviate people’s suffering.” 
He said that a political solution was required, however, preferably one brought about by negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations.

All parties have a responsibility to work to facilitate the path back to constructive dialogue and to ensure that the joint fight against Islamic State continues to be the number‑one priority.” 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (19 October) on Israel’s recent decision to continue to expand settlements in the West Bank: 
Plans to construct almost 3000 additional housing units in the West Bank were adopted this week. 
According to Israeli media reports, preparatory measures have already commenced on the territory of the planned settlement of Givat Hamatos in East Jerusalem. 
The settlement would separate the Palestinian district of Beit Safafa from other boroughs of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
The Federal Government would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the fact that it will only recognise amendments to the lines of 4 June 1967, including those with regard to Jerusalem, that are agreed to by the parties through negotiations. 
Against this backdrop, we are following reports on the continued construction of the Givat Hamatos settlement with particular concern. We call on the Israeli side to refrain from these actions. 
While settlement construction in violation of international law is not the only obstacle to a two‑state solution, each new housing unit cements a one‑state reality in which the Palestinians continue to be denied the full enjoyment of their political rights. 
The feasibility of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state is undermined, among other things, by the fact that East Jerusalem is becoming increasingly cut off from the West Bank. 
The planning committee responsible for settlement construction in the occupied West Bank recently adopted further plans for a total of almost 3000 new housing units in Israeli settlements. 
These include plans for the new settlement of Amichai, bids for just under 300 housing units in the settlement of Beit El, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had envisaged for the inhabitants of the illegal outpost of Givat HaUlpana that was cleared in 2012, as well as – for the first time since 2002 – construction permits for 31 new housing units in central Hebron. 
This would be the first new settlement in East Jerusalem since 1997. 
The European Union has made it clear on repeated occasions that settlement construction in Givat Hamatos constitutes a direct threat to the two‑state solution and has called on Israel to retract this decision. 
Article by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, published in French in “Le Monde” on 19 October 2017 
President Emmanuel Macron of France set out a courageous and far-sighted vision for the future of Europe in his speech at the Sorbonne. 
a trip around the world on Twitter 
In Franco-German relations, France is currently winning hands down as regards policy on the future of the European Union. 
Around the world in a day: 
Europe needs vision – not technocrats 
(Central European Time), the Federal Foreign Office opened its doors on Twitter to let people look behind the scenes. 
Precisely this approach has aggravated Germany’s political isolation in recent years, and has contributed to the unwillingness of many other EU member states to help Germany tackle the refugee crisis. 
The only response to Macron’s speech to emerge so far from Germany have been the proposals made by the outgoing Federal Minister of Finance on economic and monetary union (EMU). 
We should therefore seize the French proposals as an opportunity for a fresh start. 
You can look at the highlights from the 24-hour campaign here: 
Germany should thus not respond to France’s proposals with proposals promoting “business as usual”, or, yet worse, with inaction. 
Germany otherwise risks exposing the EU to further erosion and to the withdrawal of further countries from European cooperation. 
President Macron has proposed that Europe be founded anew. 
He wants a Europe that protects Europeans; a Europe that is able to safeguard its own security; a Europe that generates economic prosperity and upholds social standards; a Europe that keeps pace with research and digitalisation and which masters the shift to a green economy; and a Europe that involves the public in discussions on the future of the EU. 
Together, we should encourage a major debate on the future of Europe. 
“The Embassy in Caracas has received three passport applications. 
Economic dynamism and domestic, foreign and social security can only be achieved today by working in a European context. 
The EU must therefore be put in a position to generate stronger and sustainable growth. 
For this purpose, the EU needs greater financial resources and instruments to support investments – also from Germany. 
To do this, Germany must dispel the myth that we are supposedly a net contributor to the EU, that we are the packhorse of the EU. 
The reality is that my country is a beneficiary of the EU, not only in political and economic terms, but also financially. 
We export 60 percent of our goods and services to the EU. 
Those who, in their own countries, implement the necessary reforms of the labour market, the tax system, the fight against corruption, and public administration must be supported in this endeavour. 
The most important support is not the approval of additional, limitless public debt. 
Without a doubt, stabilising the eurozone is an important element of any reform. 
Facts, not false promises 
We should openly discuss proposals on a budget for the eurozone and the creation of a European finance minister, instead of immediately removing them from the agenda. 
The EU has clearly defined instruments to safeguard financial and monetary stability, but nothing comparable for the investments needed in the continent’s competitiveness, in tackling unemployment and deflecting economic shocks. 
Creating a Eurogroup budget, as suggested by France, is thus in my opinion an imperative addition to the instruments for safeguarding the stability of the monetary union. 
Europe needs greater tax fairness and greater social security in the labour markets. 
The rule of “the same pay for the same work in the same place” is a long-overdue principle that we should add to the single market regulations currently in force. 
As the name #rumoursaboutgermany indicates, its main aim is to get rid of misinformation by providing facts. 
Europe needs to pool its resources and learn to play in the same league as the United States, Russia and China. 
It will also be the task of the new German Government to take these ideas further, since Europe must be able to protect the public if necessary. 
Shared values are Europe’s cornerstone and “trademark”. 
“We’re fighting the rumour mill with reliable facts.” 
For 24 hours, the Federal Foreign Office shared real-time impressions from its work around the world. 
the Federal Foreign Office’s 24-hour Twitter campaign 
From the passport section in Caracas to the Minister’s Office in Berlin to the press division in Tokyo. 
A couple views information on a smartphone 
In the 24 hours from noon on 17 October to noon on 18 October 
a new Federal Foreign Office website aims to get the facts out to migrants, making them less susceptible to misinformation spread by human traffickers. 
The questions are simple. They address rumours that are widely circulated among migrants and potential refugees, for example, 
To draw migrants’ attention to the site, it is being advertised throughout Germany and in the countries of origin, on various social media platforms and with flyers. 
Human traffickers often deliberately spread such fabricated stories through the social media. 
It contains profiles of the various programmes that support voluntary returnees, the humanitarian programmes that exist in refugee camps in transit states such as Mali, Jordan and Lebanon, and assistance programmes in the countries of origin. 
“The most important aim of our Rumours about Germany campaign is to not leave the human traffickers’ myths and rumours unchallenged on the Internet, but to provide correct information ourselves. 
Under the hashtag #AA24, more than 150 tweets and photos were shared demonstrating what goes on on a normal day at our 220 missions abroad around the world, as well as at our headquarters in Berlin. 
Peeking over the shoulder of 11,000 members of staff: 
for example, in the visa section in Caracas 
The fees would be astronomical if it weren’t for the exchange rate...” 
365 days a year, around the clock and around the globe: 
From the local gardener in Kigali to the State Secretary in Berlin, during the 24-hour campaign, users were able to peek over the shoulder of more than 11,000 members of staff as they did their day-to-day work. 
German foreign policy is conducted in many places and by a wide range of people. 
More than 2.7 million users followed the campaign in real time. 
The best of our Twitter campaign (in German) 
It goes on to say that, “Contrary to rumours and misinformation deliberately spread by human traffickers, Germany does not provide a welcome payment.” 
For example, the website debunks the rumour that people everywhere in Germany speak English, or that the government gives everyone a job. 
Other articles target those who have already set out on what is frequently a dangerous journey to Europe, giving them possible alternatives. 
Through fact-based communication, we want to properly inform all those who are thinking about fleeing their home or migrating, or who have already set out on their way. In the end, we want to provide clarity,” Kindl emphasises. 
“Will I receive a welcome payment in Germany?” To this, a new website set up by the Federal Foreign Office to get correct information to migrants clearly answers “No”. 
#rumoursaboutgermany – 
It is misleading and harmful to claim that this can only be done by means of intergovernmental cooperation. 
Member states and local authorities that demonstrate solidarity and take in refugees should receive more funding from the EU budget in the future. 
The EU must also see the protection of its external borders for what it actually is – a European task. 
The European Parliament should be legitimised by the European electorate as a whole via transnational lists. 
Practice makes perfect: 
The speech by President Macron of France provides a promising road map for Europe. 
The new site, which is available in English, French and Arabic, gives a compact overview of all relevant information for migrants and refugees and provides the facts. 
It is thus meant to debunk common rumours that are being spread online by human traffickers. 
In order for his ideas to become concrete policies, Germany must position itself more intelligently and courageously. 
A wide-ranging and well-conceived European reform agenda that enjoys broad support is in our interest. 
It is time for Germany to not only pay lip service to his suggestions, but also to follow up its words with deeds. 
“The page has also been designed for use on smartphones. It contains simple and clearly formulated information for a target audience that is considering coming to, or is already en route to or has arrived in, Germany,” explains Andreas Kindl, Director for Strategic Communication, when asked about the idea behind the new website.

With the website www.rumoursaboutgermany.info, the Federal Foreign Office is continuing its information campaign of the same name, which it has been conducting abroad since the autumn of 2015. 
In countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan or Algeria, rumours about Germany run rampant – these include the claim that, in Germany, every refugee receives a house as a gift. 
“We provide the facts; we tell people that starting a new life in Germany is not as easy as many may think – without making the mistake of giving only negative examples,” says Kindl. 
Experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief have planned this joint exercise by the United Nations and countless aid organisations down to the last detail. 
What is the best way to load (and unload) helicopters carrying relief aid? 
This is all practical knowledge that is immensely important in emergency responses. 
Cooperation among equals: 
the World Food Programme and the Federal Agency for Technical Relief as partners 
The training builds on experiences garnered in recent years. 
The World Food Programme is one of the biggest recipients of German aid payments – the Federal Foreign Office has supported projects of the World Food Programme to the tune of around 560 million euros in this year alone. 
By making food and other aid relief directly available, the World Food Programme is playing a major role in efforts to fight hunger and malnutrition in crisis regions. 
The Federal Agency for Technical Relief and the Federal Foreign Office also cooperate closely in the implementation of international courses for aid organisations – such as here in the logistics and telecommunications field. 
This helps World Food Programme and UNHCR staff to be even better prepared for their deployment in humanitarian crises. 
how the Federal Agency for Technical Relief is preparing humanitarian aid workers for their deployments 
Humanitarian assistance is only successful when it gets to where it is most urgently needed.

Fortunately, this is a fictional scenario in a country that doesn’t exist. The supposed earthquake victims are being played by extras. 
More than 200 people are practising how to coordinate international humanitarian aid operations as part of this major exercise taking place over several days. 
Coordination behind the scenes – getting the logistics right 
However, political prospects for peaceful coexistence are equally important. 
Experienced experts from the field of logistics and telecommunications have therefore long been a standard feature of aid projects in most organisations.

The focus of these measures is on Syria and neighbouring countries, as well as on countries in Africa that are threatened by acute famines. 
The Federal Agency for Technical Relief contributes important expertise and knowledge to the field of humanitarian assistance that all partners stand to benefit from. 
Overview of the Federal Foreign Office’ humanitarian assistance work 
It is therefore all the more important for all stakeholders to be able to rely upon each other as 
it is often the case that every minute counts in a crisis. 
It is important to get the logistics right so that aid reaches the people who need it in emergency situations. 
The infrastructure in crisis regions is only rudimentary for the most part – roads and airports are destroyed or overloaded and mobile phone networks are out of action. 
The city only has a chance of returning to normal daily life after this time of terror with the help of extensive support from the international community. 
Within the framework of the Global Coalition against Daesh, we are thus working to foster local administrative structures that represent the people of Raqqa. 
“For almost four long years, Raqqa was a place of terror and tyranny. 
thus putting an end to the IS regime in Raqqa and retaking its last major stronghold. 
With the support of the Global Coalition against Daesh, the Syrian Democratic Forces have now taken complete control of the city, 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the attack in Egypt 
Federal Foreign Office condemns attacks in Afghanistan 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (21 October) on the attacks in Afghanistan: 
The perfidious attacks in Ghor and Kabul targeted people who wanted to practise their religion in the mosque. 
Our sympathy goes out to the families and friends of the victims. 
Our thoughts are also with the many people injured. We wish them a speedy recovery. 
Nothing can justify this senseless violence. 
Our thoughts are with the victims’ families and friends. 
The international community will continue to stand up resolutely together to the threat of terrorism. 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with Egypt in the fight against terrorism.” 
“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the perfidious attack on Egyptian security forces near Bahariya oasis, in which several dozen police officers were killed and many others injured. 
We condemn in the strongest possible terms the attacks in Afghanistan that claimed dozens of lives yesterday. 
Belgrade has been a linguistically and culturally diverse city for centuries. 
Literature is the prism through which we are able to experience this diversity. 
This is an opportunity to pay homage to the tradition of swapping stories, above all here in Belgrade, the marketplace of stories and meeting point for storytellers. 
In Belgrade, Minister of State Böhmer will also meet Prime Minister Ana Brnabić and Minister of Culture and Information Vladan Vukosavljević for talks on bilateral relations and cultural cooperation between Germany and Serbia. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (20 October) on the liberation of Raqqa: 
IS treated its civilian population with the utmost brutality and spread terror from the city as far as Europe. 
This is an important step in the fight against terror. However, this battle is still far from being won. 
This includes clearing the perfidious booby‑traps laid by IS that pose a deadly threat to people in Raqqa and those who want to return there. 
The German Government has already earmarked ten million euros for this. 
Furthermore, progress is needed as regards a political transition, including under the Geneva process, in order to ensure a good future for Syria as a whole and for all Syrians and to prevent a return to terror in Raqqa and elsewhere.” 
During joint training sessions, employees from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief and aid organisations learn how to cooperate effectively prior to their deployments. 
Both relief aid and aid workers often have to go a long way before getting to where they are required. 
At this joint multi‑day training session at the Federal Agency for Technical Relief school in Neuhausen near Stuttgart, the very first of its kind, humanitarian aid workers from the field of logistics and telecommunications now have the opportunity to run through procedures in practical exercises and simulations. 
How do aid workers from different organisations coordinate their efforts on the ground? 
This is the first time that the logistics and telecommunications teams coordinated by the World Food Programme are holding their courses jointly, thereby helping to make a real difference through improved coordination on the ground. 
For many years, the Federal Foreign Office has supported the Federal Agency for Technical Relief’s aid interventions in acute crises – such as in the Philippines (following typhoon Haiyan) and in Nepal (in the wake of the earthquake in 2015). 
Following the recent earthquake in Mexico, Federal Agency for Technical Relief workers were likewise rapidly deployed in the region. 
Germany continues to stand resolutely shoulder to shoulder with the Afghan people. 
Together with the international community, we will keep supporting Afghanistan’s reconstruction and stabilisation efforts. 
There can be no justification for such terrorist attacks. 
Germany’s contribution to the discussion on the future of Europe should not be restricted to monetary union, and should not be predominantly determined by the familiar orthodoxies of German European policy with regard to finance. 
If it does, we risk ending up with a weak Europe. 
We should take the following elements as our point of departure: 
Only when our neighbouring countries are doing well will our children have employment in Germany. 
Yet, those who – like France – undertake courageous structural reforms in their own countries must also be given more time to reduce their budget deficits. 
Strengthening the ESM and setting up a European monetary fund is the right approach, 
but not if this fund is devised as a technocratic regulatory authority with no democratic legitimacy. 
Unlimited competition in the single market is a good thing, but not when it involves paying the worst wages and providing the least social security. 
In the 21st century, Europe also needs to redefine its role in the world at large. 
It must use its common foreign and security policy in order to gradually become an advocate for Europeans’ interests in the world. 
Our children's only choice is between having a joint voice in the world or no voice at all. 
Europe therefore needs to stop “punching below its weight” in the outside world. 
Germany and France have already worked closely together in the past, for example within the framework of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). 
Governments should not play the national sovereignty card against the EU when repudiating any such shared values. 
Should it become clear that necessary European projects are not currently feasible with all member states, groups of member states should be able to go ahead on their own. 
Naturally, such “group work” must not come at the cost of cohesion. The door must therefore always remain open for all those who are only able to participate at a later stage. 
Challenges that affect some member states to a greater extent than others purely because of their geographical location must be addressed together by the EU and all member states. 
All commissioners should receive a democratic mandate for their term in office whose legitimacy equals that of a mandate at national level. 
Conversely, the Commission should be reduced in size and become more political. 
We are open to the idea of a “refoundation” which includes member states’ civil societies. 
We should not rule out treaty reform from the outset, but should engage over the long term in a strategic debate on Europe’s future. 
Minister of State Böhmer on the opening of the International Belgrade Book Fair 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer issued the following statement today (20 October) prior to her trip to the Serbian capital to attend the opening of the International Belgrade Book Fair:

Those who voted against the draft bear the full responsibility. 
The Federal Government will continue to work to ensure the perpetrators are identified and finally brought to justice. 
Key importance attaches to the next report to be issued by the JIM which is due to be published in the next few days. 
Cooperation with civil society in the Eastern Partnership 
Bild mit Bildunterschrift: 
The German Government is funding measures that provide comprehensive support to the necessary transformation and integration processes via collaboration between German civil society and civil societies in the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine) and Russia. 
This spans the entire range of cultural and civic education projects, with a focus on media, academia, education including vocational training, culture, language and work with young people. 
Aims of cooperation with civil society 
One of the programme’s main aims is to create and expand a pluralistic media landscape and in so doing to increase the recognition of and respect for diversity of opinion within society. 
Also, the aim is to give young people from the region in particular prospects for their own economic, societal and social development. 
Another important goal is to restore the willingness to enter into dialogue and build understanding between societies whose states are parties to a territorial conflict. 
Unresolved tensions resulting from different historical narratives have also led to deep rifts among the civil societies. 
So the programme seeks to support people and organisations that work with the affected groups to encourage them to understand the other side’s point of view and develop a willingness to compromise from this understanding. 
Submitting project ideas 
Project outlines can be submitted via the website given below up until 15 December 2017. 
Please note that project outlines submitted by any other route cannot be accepted. 
Information on the Federal Foreign Office Programme “Expanding Cooperation with Civil Society in the Eastern Partnership Countries and Russia” (PDF, 103 KB) 
a long-standing partner 
Over the past four years, the programme “Expanding Cooperation with Civil Society in the Eastern Partnership Countries and Russia” has received over 2200 project submissions and implemented more than 650 projects with a total volume of some 46 million, thereby helping numerous civil-society organisations to play their role as key actors and important partners for government action. 
Project ideas can be submitted as part of a pre‑selection process up until 15 December. 
Supporting civil-society engagement © Potsdam Media International e.V. 
There are various ways to do this, including providing basic and further training for journalists, bloggers and other media actors and by running projects to improve media skills, for instance at schools and universities. 
Another important goal of the project is to promote a discussion of fundamental values, such as respect for human rights, the legitimacy of the administration, the independence of the judiciary, the right of the individual to life and self‑determination, as well as the principle of majority decision, by means of exchange and cultural projects and civil-society dialogue. 
Training and further training projects are regarded as the foundations on which all people build their personal dreams and prospects for the future and so the programme focuses on these, too. 
As there was huge interest in support within the scope of the programme in past years, civil-society actors in Germany and the region can now submit their project ideas for 2018 (in the form of a project outline) as part of the pre‑selection process. 
The two countries have been cooperating for several years already on biosecurity. 
Federal Foreign Office on the investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria 
The Federal Government cannot comprehend why the members of the Security Council were unable to agree on an extension of the JIM and thus further investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. 
This equates to a devastating signal of impunity for those who are responsible for the use of chemical weapons in Syria. 
At the same time, the right of the victims of chemical weapons in Syria and the investigation of these crimes are not being taken into account and here people had vested their hope in the international community. 
Working together to improve biosecurity – 
Germany and Georgia strengthen their partnership 
Ambassador Peitsch welcomes the participants © Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology / German Partnership Program for Excellence in Biological and Health Security 
A two-day event in Tbilisi focused on efforts to counter biological risks. 
Last week, on 19 and 20 October, Georgian and German experts gathered for a symposium on biosecurity. 
“This is a welcome opportunity to celebrate our close partnership based on trust,” the German Ambassador Heike Peitzsch said. 
The event drew a large audience © Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology / German Partnership Program for Excellence in Biological and Health Security 
Georgia has been a partner country ever since the German Partnership Program for Excellence in Biological and Health Security was established. 
The programme aims to create a higher level of awareness about biological risks and to strengthen partner countries’ detection and diagnostic capabilities. 
Germany's Federal Foreign Office launched the programme in 2013. The programme currently comprises activities in 12 countries. 
Its activities are intended to mitigate biological risks and the associated risks of proliferation. 
LGBTI rights 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on reports concerning lists of homosexuals in Tajikistan 
Many indications here point to a violation of the personal and sexual freedom of those affected. 
Reports from Tajikistan concerning lists created by the interior authorities of allegedly homosexual persons fill me with concern. 
I call on the Tajik authorities to establish clarity in this matter and to curb any form of discrimination in order to avoid injustice. 
All forms of discrimination on account of sexual orientation must be opposed resolutely. 
Homosexuality is not officially a punishable crime in Tajikistan. 
In a globalised world, it is especially important to pursue joint efforts to counter biological risks, such as the intentional misuse of pathogens and toxins, and to mitigate the risk of an outbreak of highly pathogenic diseases or pandemics. 
The current German‑Georgian year of 2017, which marks 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, is a good opportunity to strengthen cooperation between Germany and Georgia in various domains. 
However, those affected have reported social discrimination and a feeling that their rights are being greatly restricted. 
On 17 October 2017, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Tajikistan reported that the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Tajikistan had created a registry of allegedly homosexual women and men following two raids last year. 
Business Round Table in Auckland on Tuesday, 7 November 2017 
Honorary Consul Bachmann [Begrüßung protokollarisch erforderlich?] 
This is an encouraging signal, a first step. 
I am pleased that our mediation efforts over the past few weeks have seen this initial success. 
The decision shows that our voice for the rule of law and our calls for a fair trial are being heard and our efforts for Peter Steudtner bearing fruit. 
Things should continue along this path. 
today’s court decision must not blind us to the fact that other Germans are still in detention in Turkey on incomprehensible grounds. 
We will not cease to press for their release and for a solution in those cases too. 
Amnesty has been instrumental in repeatedly drawing attention to shortcomings in Turkey. This important voice must not fall silent. 
The Turkish side needs to understand that 
I also welcome the fact that some Amnesty International workers have been released from pre-trial detention. 
a functioning civil society is a guarantor of lively political debate, and such debate is precisely what is needed to broaden the basis for the legitimation of political decisions. 
Many thanks for your kind words of introduction and for your hospitality. 
I would like to discuss business relations between our two countries with you this lunchtime. 
[to everyone]: I am pleased to have the opportunity to talk with you this lunchtime. 
Germany was New Zealand’s sixth-biggest trading partner in 2016. 
It is an expression of our community of shared values. 
In Germany, we have just started to talk about the managed immigration of highly qualified people. 
And what conclusions can we draw from this for Germany? 
Will New Zealand remain a partner for open trade relations also in the future? 
Trade, be it in machines, vehicles [New Zealand’s main import], agricultural products [New Zealand’s main export] or services, is more than just an economic transaction. 
Our open, rules-based trade system is one of the foundations of the international order. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the start of the trial of Peter Steudtner and other human rights activists 
Foreign Minister Gabriel today (25 October) issued the following statement on the start of the trial of Peter Steudtner and other human rights activists: 
I am glad that the court in Istanbul has today ordered Peter Steudtner to be released on bail from pre-trial detention. 
What is your take on the development of measures to attract skilled labour in New Zealand in recent years? 
Secondly, New Zealand and Germany both benefit from free trade – the willingness to support this approach appears to have a particularly broad base in this country. 
This is a reflection of our economies’ interconnectedness – despite being 18,000 km apart. 
Firstly, many Germans have something of a soft spot for New Zealand – and it is one of the world’s most popular countries of immigration [although attempts have been made recently to curb immigration owing to a housing shortage, among other reasons]. 
How do New Zealanders view this approach? 
My visit to New Zealand is the last stop on my trip. 
I’m looking forward to hearing your opinions and experiences – and also to finding out your perspective on Germany.

“It is amazing what Germany does to repatriate its soldiers and citizens. 
But for the 16 United Nations Ambassadors who were in Germany last week to learn more about global engagement in the health sector, the trip to Tegel Airport was part of their programme. 
The crew can provide the patients with modern intensive care, including artificial respiration. 
It is very impressive how Germany also uses the plane to help other countries.” 
Special Representative of the Federal Government for Afghanistan and Pakistan 
Ambassador Markus Potzel © Federal Foreign Office 
In this capacity, he coordinates Germany’s diplomatic engagement with the region and liaises with international partners on ways of further enhancing stability there. 
He was German Ambassador to Afghanistan from August 2014 to August 2016. 
Germany’s involvement in Afghanistan 
Ambassador Markus Potzel, Federal Foreign Office Director for South Asia, was appointed Special Representative of the Federal Government for Afghanistan and Pakistan in September 2017. 
With his appointment, Ambassador Potzel also takes over as Chair of the International Contact Group on Afghanistan (ICG), which was chaired by his predecessor Ambassador Sabine Sparwasser, from July 2015. 
Most recently, he served as Crisis Management Commissioner at the Federal Foreign Office. 
Over 50 countries and international organisations meet regularly in the ICG to discuss developments in Afghanistan. 
A Jewish-Muslim tale of rescue: 
First Arab to be honoured as “Righteous Among the Nations” 
Thirty-five years after his death, Mohamed Helmy is to be honoured as the first Arab Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Remembrance Center. 
Anna the Jew and Mohamed the Muslim © Taliya Finkel Productions 
When Helmy, a native of Egypt, came to Berlin in 1922 to study medicine, he had no idea of the uphill struggle ahead. 
But during the Nazi regime, he lost his job - as a non-Aryan he was not allowed to work in the public health sector. 
Mohamed Helmy risked his life by offering a Jewish family refuge in a hut in the Buch district of Berlin. 
The story of Mohamed and Anna 
Mohamed Helmy, the family man © Taliya Finkel Productions 
The Federal Foreign Office’s Afghanistan and Pakistan Division reports to the Special Representative. 
Ambassador Potzel has worked at the Federal Foreign Office since 1993 and brings many years of wide-ranging diplomatic experience in South Asia and the Middle East to his new role. 
Thereafter, Mohamed pretended Anna was his niece, even directly under the noses of the Gestapo. 
Right until the end of the War, he looked after the family of four and thus saved their lives. 
The family later migrated to the United States 
but they never forgot their rescuer. 
The Airbus is used to transport sick and wounded people over long distances. 
In several letters, they called upon the Berlin Senate to pay tribute to Helmy as a rescuer of Jews. 
This was the case after natural disasters when humanitarian assistance was provided, and after terror attacks, for example in Djerba. 
Mohamed and Anna stayed in touch for the rest of their lives. 
Tribute paid by the Yad Vashem Remembrance Center 
The Yad Vashem Remembrance Center in Jerusalem honours people, particularly non-Jews, who risked their own lives to save Jews. 
Mr Helmy's family now wants to accept this title. 
Two books have been written telling his story: 
Bilateral relations with Israel 
Mohamed Helmy risked his life to save the Jew Anna Boros and her family from the National Socialists. 
The rescuer - himself targeted by the regime 
Nor was he allowed to marry his German fiancée. 
In 1939, he was arrested together with other Egyptians and spent a year in prison. 
Although he himself had been targeted by the regime, the doctor from Egypt never ceased speaking out against the inhumane policies of the Nazis. 
Anna was a patient of his and turned to Mohamed at a time of absolute desperation. 
This is also a way of keeping the memory of the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust alive. 
On 12 March 2013, the Commission for the Designation of the Righteous in Yad Vashem decided to honour Mohamed Helmy with the title “Righteous Among the Nations” as the first Muslim rescuer of Arab descent. 
Mr Bibby [President of the German-New Zealand Chamber of Commerce (AHK)], 
I have been able to gain an impression of the Asia-Pacific region’s impressive diversity over the past few days – in political, cultural and administrative terms. 
Around 1.8 billion euros’ worth of goods and services are traded between Germany and New Zealand each year [imports and exports between the EU and New Zealand total around 8 billion euros]. 
Germany and New Zealand owe their strength in large part to this foundation [New Zealand strongly export-oriented, key economic data very positive, e.g. unemployment rate of 4.8 percent in 2016]. 
We intend to continue working together to promote open markets in the future.

Air rescue – UN Ambassadors view a flying intensive care unit 
From the outside, it looks like a normal aeroplane – but inside, it’s equipped with the latest technology 
The guests from sub‑Saharan Africa went to the airport to see the German Air Force’s flying intensive care unit, the Airbus A310 MedEvac. 
Dr Werner explaining how patients are transported © Marco Parge 
“Air ambulances are used to take the pressure off medical infrastructure on the ground or to provide treatment that cannot be carried out locally,” Ulrich Werner, the medical director and senior consultant on board, told the UN Ambassadors. 
Depending on how many people need to be transported, Werner is accompanied by a medical crew of up to 25 people, who provide care around the clock. 
Six of these patients can be transported in units that provide the same standard of care as a bed in an intensive care unit in a hospital. 
In ten further units, equipment can be installed to measure vital statistics such as blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The readings are displayed on a centralised computer screen, 
thus enabling the medical team to monitor patients even when they cannot treat them, that is, during take‑off, landing and severe turbulence.” 
Colonel Werner of the Medical Corps explaining the MedEvac to the UN Ambassadors 
“We usually have two or three patients on a flight,” Werner explained. 
“In the past 15 years, our Airbus was full around ten times.” 
but were able to learn a lot about the flying intensive care unit. 
Martha Pobee, Ghana’s Ambassador to the UN, was very impressed by the aeroplane. 
“I have never seen anything like it,” she said. 
We can learn a great deal from this in Africa. 
It must reorganise and initiate substantial reforms. 
It must reinvigorate the culture of peace.

The EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework – A reflection of Europe’s political priorities 
MFF – The abbreviation stands for the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework, the European Union’s budget for a seven-year period. 
the EU’s budget expenditure also sets its political priorities. 
“So every euro we pay into the EU budget comes back to us – directly or indirectly – several times over,” the Minister has said. 
The German Bundestag decides each year how much the German budget is going to be. 
This ensures that the EU’s annual expenditure is predictable. 
Budget priorities: 
What Open Day visitors would like to see 
During Open Day at the Federal Foreign Office, visitors were invited to take a look at the subject and then vote for what they thought the EU should spend its money on. 
The results of this admittedly unscientific and unrepresentative survey showed very clear preferences. 
Expenditure under the current MFF is distributed something like this... 
...and this is how Federal Foreign Office Open Day visitors voted © FFO 
A: 
Defence policy, foreign and development policy (incl. migration policy); protecting the EU’s external borders, public safety and combating terrorism

C: 
Economic promotion and tackling unemployment 
D: 
Climate and environment policy 
E:

Federal Foreign Office on report on the use of chemical weapons in Syria 
The report, which was submitted to the United Nations Security Council yesterday, confirms that 
The report also reveals that IS was responsible for the use of mustard gas in Um-Housh on 15 and 16 September 2016. 
The latest report shows how important this work is. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (27 October) on the situation in Catalonia: 
This must be clear to all members of the international community. 
Even the regime’s supporters cannot turn a blind eye to these acts. 
the inhumane use of sarin in Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017 was the work of the Assad regime. 
Of this there can be no serious doubt. 
The Security Council now has to agree on an appropriately clear response. 
We appeal to all its members to embrace their responsibility and reconsider extending the JIM in order also to identify those behind other incidents involving the use of chemical weapons. 
It is not just a matter of money, or – to put it more accurately – something over a thousand billion euros for the period 2014-2020: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has advocated investing more in the EU budget, for instance in education, research, digital infrastructure and a joint foreign policy for the EU: 
The EU budget was also a topic at the Federal Foreign Office Open Day: visitors were invited to vote for their ideal budget. 
What is the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)? 
At European level, the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) fixes the EU’s maximum budget for a period of seven years. The MFF sets down the ceilings that the EU is permitted to spend on individual policy fields each year, i.e. the maximum amount that can be spent on research in a year. 
Over the next few months, the European Commission will be presenting its proposals for the next MFF, which will be valid from 2021.

They could place three coins on ballot boxes representing the different policy fields to show where they felt the priorities should lie. 
People would invest most in education and research, climate and environment, foreign and security policy, and economic promotion. 
The current MFF focuses on payments to the agricultural sector under the Common Agricultural Policy and on assistance for structurally weak regions of the EU. 
A strong, united and stable Spain is important to us. 
Through this clearly proven use of a chemical weapon, the Syrian regime has once again inflicted extreme suffering and committed another violation of both the Chemical Weapons Convention and international humanitarian law. 
This must have consequences; such monstrous crimes cannot be allowed to go unpunished. 
Drawing new borders and building new walls in Europe is not in the interest of Europe’s citizens. 
Particularly now, when the countries on Europe’s doorstep are experiencing unrest and conflict, Europe must present a strong, united front. 
The fact remains that only talks based on the rule of law and within the framework of the Spanish Constitution can bring about a solution. That is why we will not recognise Catalonia’s unilateral declaration of independence. 
Sustainability concerns us all and is now what people expect our actions to be underpinned by. 
We are responsible for leaving behind an environment worth living in for future generations to enjoy. 
Research and education establishments are of central importance for sustainable development. 
Solutions to global challenges must take due account of the complexity of global and local sustainability problems. 
This can only happen if we have the broadest possible approach. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (27 October) on the report of the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), the joint investigative mechanism of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations (UN), on identifying those responsible for the use of chemical weapons in Syria: 
The OPCW Executive Council needs to hold a special session to discuss the report. 
Here, too, we are working to bring this about.

When we look back at 500 years of the Reformation tomorrow, we will do so in the knowledge that our country’s foreign policy must stand up for these values more than ever before. 
The answer to these challenges cannot be to withdraw to a national bubble. 
The Federal Foreign Office is marking the anniversary of the Reformation with a host of activities around the world, from Europe to Asia, including two major exhibitions in the United States. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (30 October) on the public holiday on 31 October to mark the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. 
Today’s conflict-ridden world is in search of direction. We are witnessing increasing authoritarianism and resurging nationalism. As a result, values associated with the Reformation, such as peace, freedom and responsibility, are under pressure. 
Instead, we must recall Martin Luther’s call to “get involved!”. With this in mind, we must work resolutely for equity and peace worldwide and seek dialogue with those who do not share our values. 
In this context, we also aim to make greater use of religions’ peacemaking potential in our foreign policy than we have done so far, with the aim of fostering equity and justice in societies around the world.” 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the 500th anniversary of the Reformation 
“The Reformation and its effects changed the world and our societies far beyond Germany and led Europe into the modern era. 
In its Responsibility of the Religions for Peace initiative, the Federal Foreign Office is conducting a close and organised dialogue with representatives of different faiths from a large number of countries and regions. 
In Singapore, Germany’s strong interest in expanding relations with ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will be the focus of attention. 
We owe our current humanistic, enlightened world view not least to the reformers and their work. 
The exhibition, Here I Stand, featured paintings and exhibits on the life and work of Martin Luther and the Reformation. It was shown in New York, Atlanta and Minneapolis and coordinated by the Halle State Museum of Prehistory. 
The exhibition, Renaissance and Reformation: German Art in the Age of Dürer and Cranach, a joint project by the National Museums in Berlin, the Dresden State Art Collections and the Bavarian State Painting Collections, cast new light on the Reformation and its era when it was shown at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). 
Afterwards, the Federal President and Elke Büdenbender will pay state visits to Australia and New Zealand from 3 to 8 November.

Looking at the Middle East, there are not many grounds for hope. 
The war in Syria has now been raging for over seven years; Israel is surrounded in part by countries at war with it; and the Middle East peace process between Israelis and Palestinians has been treading water for far too long. 
Daniel Barenboim has made it his life’s mission to stand up against hatred and irreconcilability and to bring people closer together through music. 
“The impossible is far easier to achieve than the difficult,” 
Daniel Barenboim said when he conducted the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Ramallah in 2005. I have never forgotten his words, 
Outside the realm of politics, cultural activities prepare the ground that makes political understanding possible in the first place. 
Minister of State Böhmer represents the Federal Republic of Germany at the UNESCO General Conference in Paris 
and provides a safe space far away from the crisis-hit regions, where Daniel Barenboim gives young Arab and Israeli students the opportunity to play music, study and work together, and in doing so to become open to the other side’s point of view. 
The Barenboim-Said Akademie thus stands in its own way for what is also important to us in our cultural relations policy, namely joint cultural activities and endeavours to foster a vibrant civil society by creating culture together. 
Since the era of Willy Brandt, cultural relations and education policy have been an essential part of our efforts to bring about peace and stability. 
In conflict-ridden times such as these, we need cultural activities more than ever. 
That is also why we are supporting the Barenboim-Said Akademie by funding scholarships. 
She issued the following statement today (31 October) prior to her departure for the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris: 
The great statesman Shimon Peres, who died a year ago, stood for overcoming confrontation and animosity so that Israel can one day live in peace with a Palestinian state in part because he firmly believed that peace results “not necessarily from love, but rather need”. 
Seventy-two years after the founding of UNESCO, globalisation, the digital revolution and climate change are reshaping our world in fundamental ways. 
Only by joining forces will we be able to travel the ambitious path that lies ahead. 
The 39th UNESCO General Conference is taking place from 30 October to 14 November. 
Bringing together the 195 Member States and meeting every two years, the General Conference is UNESCO’s primary decision-making body. 
An international organisation for EU relations with Latin America and the Caribbean 
On Thursday (26 October) the German Government deposited its instrument of ratification to the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation. 
Minister of State Maria Böhmer will head the German delegation at the UNESCO General Conference in Paris. 
Through research and teaching, universities develop and communicate knowledge, skills, competences and values. They train multipliers and future leaders. 
The title is granted by UNESCO at the proposal of the German Commission for UNESCO for outstanding dedication in the UNESCO spheres (education, research, culture and information). 
An impossible achievement 
It is the only place of its kind in the world, 
To enable it to become operational as quickly as possible, the EU-LAC Foundation was initially constituted as a foundation under German law. 
Minister of State Böhmer at the annual meeting of UNESCO Chairs in Germany held in Heidelberg 
On 27 October, the UNESCO Chairs in Germany met in Heidelberg to discuss their contributions to the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, also know as Agenda 2030. 
Minister of State Böhmer, Special Representative of the Federal Foreign Office for UNESCO World Heritage, UNESCO Cultural Conventions and UNESCO Education and Science Programmes, issued the following statement about attending the meeting: 
We must aspire to be the generation who managed to turn the corner to a sustainable society. 
The particular focus on transdisciplinary work and participatory approaches are very important as they involve a broad spectrum of players in society also beyond the academic sphere. 
The eleven UNESCO Chairs in Germany are part of a network set up in 1992 which today brings together some 700 university chairs in more than 120 countries. 
In just a few days, UNESCO will celebrate the 25th anniversary of its network of Chairs. 
The EU-LAC Foundation will become the EU-LAC International Foundation once eight signatories from each of the two regions, including the EU and Germany as host country, have deposited their instruments of ratification with the Council of the European Union. 
Natural partners on key issues for the future 
The Foundation was established in 2010 at the sixth EU-LAC Summit. 
A special way of creating an international organisation 
The foundation was always meant to become an international organisation. 
“Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe are natural partners on key issues for the future, such as climate protection, the sustainable exploitation of resources and free trade,” stated Marian Schuegraf, Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Federal Foreign Office. 
“We are delighted that, with the establishment of the EU-LAC International Foundation, this partnership will be further enhanced, especially between civil society in our regions.” 
Civil society cooperation constitutes a key element of the Foundation’s work.

Enhancing relations between the EU and Latin America and the Caribbean – that’s what is at the heart of the EU-LAC Foundation’s mission. 
This was, however, never intended as a permanent solution. 
The Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation was signed on 25 October 2016, and now, one year later, it has been ratified by Germany. 
The instrument of ratification © FFO 
The international organisation will focus on a broad range of issues, including sustainability, democracy, and how universities can be got into shape for the 21st century. 
The Foundation will be financed by means of voluntary contributions from the European Commission, European and Latin American states, foundations, development banks and the private sector. 
Germany’s contribution will come from the Federal Foreign Office and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. 
Following the release from prison of Mahvash Sabet and Fariba Kamalabadi, two leading members of the Bahá’i faith in Iran, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Bärbel Kofler, issued the following statement today (1 November): 
I welcome the fact that two of the seven leading members of Iran’s Bahá’i community have finally been released from prison after being incarcerated for almost ten years. 
The historic commercial metropolis on the Elbe was thus able to fend off strong competition for the honour of housing the Foundation from Madrid, Paris and Bologna. 
The Hanseatic City provides an ideal working environment, thanks to the strong ties between stakeholders active in business, civil society and research on Latin America, as well as the long-standing ties with the region. 
Mahvash Sabet was released in September and Fariba Kamalabadi at the end of October. 
However, five more leading figures are still in jail. 
I thus call upon the Iranian judiciary to release the remaining five leading Bahá’is without delay, along with all other prisoners held on account of their religious beliefs. 
It is high time to put an end to the persecution of the Bahá’is and other religious minorities on account of their faith. 
The seven members of the ad‑hoc Bahá’i leadership committee were arrested on 5 March and 14 May 2008. 
They were held without charge for over two years in Tehran’s Evin Prison before being sentenced on 8 August 2010 to 20 years’ imprisonment each. 
In late 2015 it was announced that the sentences had been reduced to ten years. 
Mahvash Sabet was released on 18 September 2017 and Fariba Kamalabadi on 31 October 2017. 
According to Asma Jahangir, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, more than 90 Bahá’is are currently being held in prisons across the country.

Luther Decade theme years – flyer issued by the EKD (PDF, 1 MB) 
The General Debate of the UNESCO General Conference started in Paris today (1 November). 
With the support of the Federal Foreign Office, German and US partner museums organised two exhibitions in the United States from October 2016 as part of the Reformation anniversary celebrations: 
Most of the exhibits are being displayed in the United States for the first time and the majority of them have never been seen outside Germany. 
In this way each of the three exhibition locations is hosting unique presentations that are tailored specifically to the American partner institutions and their target groups. 
They draw attention to the authentic locations and significant collections in the birthplace of the Reformation whose rich and striking assets are not yet as well known as they deserve to be, given their significance beyond the region. 
It focuses on the events in the life of Martin Luther that played a particularly crucial role in the early years of the Reformation. 
It is on display at one of the ten largest art museums in the United States, which is predestined for an exhibition to mark the anniversary of the Reformation due to its location in the Midwest, the Lutheran heartland of the US, and its international reputation. 
The focus in 2016 was therefore on its global influence. 
Millions of people had fled their homes owing to the destabilisation of entire regions, she went on. 
Böhmer said the following in her address to the representatives of the Member States at the General Conference: 
“One of the answers to the challenges of our time is a strong UNESCO that is capable of action.” 
Böhmer said that she deeply regretted the fact that the US and Israel had announced their intention to withdraw from UNESCO. 
The tasks facing UNESCO were immense especially in this period of realignment, she said, 
In view of our own history, working to foster peace in the Middle East remains a key foreign policy task for us. 
Changes were necessary in order for the organisation to be able to perform its tasks efficiently, she continued. 
Sustainability meant not only good stewardship of our natural resources, she went on, but should also be the benchmark for our economic and social policies and actions. 
Germany is being represented by Minister of State Maria Böhmer. 
The debate is the culmination of the General Conference, which takes place every two years and is a forum in which Member States reach important strategic decisions. 
She said that new forms of terrorism were seeking to eradicate peoples’ cultural identities. 
which is why reliable partners such as the US and Israel were needed in UNESCO. 
Minister of State Böhmer at the UNESCO General Conference in Paris 
Not only is a new Director-General set to be elected, 
but the agency is facing great challenges since the United States announced its intention to withdraw its membership. 
comprehensive reforms to the organisation’s structure and substance were urgently required, in addition to improvements to the agency’s precarious financial situation. 
At a time full of global challenges, focusing on UNESCO’s core tasks was more important than ever, Böhmer said, adding that peace and sustainability should be accorded greater priority. 
In her speech, Minister of State Böhmer emphasised how urgently needed the UN agency’s work was today, adding that the number of crises and conflicts around the world was increasing. 
She said that the increasing politicisation of UNESCO had to be opposed and that 
Moreover, she added, UNESCO’s National Commissions had to be strengthened and their expertise put to better use. 
“We must aspire to help all people live good and independent lives,” Böhmer said. 
Sustainable education was and deserved to be at the heart of what UNESCO does, she added. 
“Enshrining the culture of peace among the peoples of the world has always been UNESCO’s prime objective,” said Böhmer. “This is a burning issue right now. UNESCO is facing one of its greatest challenges today. Let us take these challenges as an opportunity to strengthen UNESCO in the long term. That is what, in the end, will determine whether or not we reach our common goal: a just and peaceful world.” 
UNESCO was founded in 1945 and is one of 16 legally independent organisations in the United Nations with 195 Members and 11 Associate Members.

For the Minister of State, this means that education for humanity, as well as promoting education, culture and values were key. 
For this reason, Germany is engaged worldwide in the protection, preservation and reconstruction of cultural heritage. 
Maria Böhmer, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, stated: 
With its global commitment to preserving culture, Germany is promoting and making an important contribution to intercultural dialogue. 
Like no other, this Temple embodies religious pluralism in Indonesia. 
Since 2011, the German conservation experts Prof. Leisen und Dr von Plehwe-Leisen have been using cultural preservation funding for a joint project with UNESCO to repair the damage and conserve the rock. 
Workshops and seminars are provided for staff to ensure they receive expert training. 
Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office 
On Friday (3 November), the project will be brought to a successful conclusion after 6 years of support and the restored Temple Compounds will be opened again to the public in an official ceremony. 
Germany supports restoration of threatened World Cultural Heritage in Indonesia 
Alongside war and terrorism, it is primarily natural disasters that are responsible for destroying cultural property. They thus pose a threat to humanity’s cultural heritage and cultural diversity. 
Together with UNESCO, the Federal Foreign Office is working to preserve one of the most important World Cultural Heritage sites, the Borobudur Temple Compounds in Indonesia. 
With this project, UNESCO and the Federal Foreign Office is supporting the preservation of one of the most important World Cultural Heritage sites, the Borobudur Temple Compounds. 
Through its Cultural Preservation Programme, the Federal Foreign Office has supported some 2800 projects in 144 countries since 1981. 
In 2010, the compound was covered by volcanic ash during an eruption, damaging the rock structure of the elaborate reliefs and numerous Buddha sculptures. 
Alongside its religious and cultural significance, it is one of Indonesia's most popular attractions and also bears important witness to the country’s cultural identity.

“One conference, Two zones” 
When a volcano erupted in 2010, the complex was completely covered by a layer of volcanic ash 
which damaged the rock structure of the elaborate reliefs and numerous Buddha sculptures. 
Restoration work was urgently needed to preserve the temple from decay. 
In parallel to the conservation measures, workers on the site receive expert training in workshops and other frameworks.

Within the scope of its Cultural Preservation Programme, the Federal Foreign Office has supported some 2800 projects in 144 countries since 1981. 
Care is taken to ensure that the local population, experts and partners on the ground are involved in the work and receive training in the spheres of conservation, restoration and digitisation. 
After the conference, the flower meadow in the Rheinaue Park is to be restored. 
The spotlight will also be on the connection between climate and security, as well as the global energy transition. 
We are deeply shocked by the news from Texas. 
We categorically condemn this senseless act of violence against people peacefully taking part in a church service. 
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to all Americans mourning today.

The temple’s world-famous reliefs were damaged following a volcanic eruption. 
Built between 750 and 850 AD, Borobudur Temple in Indonesia is regarded as one of the largest and most important Buddhist structures in the world. 
More than any other building, Borobudur represents the religious pluralism anchored in Indonesia’s constitution. 
Following six years of intensive restoration work, the Borobudur Temple Compounds were today (3 November) handed over. 
Since 2011, the Cultural Preservation Programme of the Federal Foreign Office has been supporting a UNESCO research project aimed at preserving the stone using modern analytical and conservation techniques developed in the course of the project by German experts Prof. Leisen and Dr von Plehwe-Leisen. 
Interview with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in “Bild am Sonntag” (5 November 2017). 
In particular, our thoughts are with the friends and families of the victims and with the many injured. 
It is the largest international conference ever hosted in Germany: from 6 to 17 November up to 25,000 representatives of governments and NGOs are gathering in Bonn for the 23rd UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23). 
New climate protection initiatives, innovative projects and sustainable solutions will be the focus of attention as up to 25,000 players from the world of politics, civil society, business, academia and industry come together in Bonn. 
The task will be to send a clear political message on climate protection: at the 23rd Climate Change Conference an understanding will be reached on further steps to implement the Paris Agreement. 
Bonn is hosting the conference, while Fiji is presiding over it. Fittingly, the conference motto is “One conference, Two zones”. Negotiations will be conducted in the Bula Zone – bula means hello in Fiji. All climate events and exhibits by state or non‑state stakeholders are being hosted in temporary structures in the Rheinaue Park. 
UN location Bonn © City of Bonn 
The island state of Fiji is presiding over the conference for the first time, but is unable to stage it; the small country does not have the logistical capacities which a conference with up to 25,000 participants requires. 
The conference is therefore taking place in Bonn, the headquarters of the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN FCCC). 
Sustainability – another focus of the conference 
Climate protection and sustainability are not only the themes of the conference, for the conference itself is to be as sustainable as possible: mostly vegetarian food will be on offer, while waste is to be kept to a minimum.

Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sent a message of condolence to King Felipe VI of Spain following the terrorist attack in his country. 
“I was shocked and saddened to hear of the perfidious and brutal terrorist attack on passers-by in the centre of Barcelona, which claimed the lives of so many people. 
In concrete terms, this means 
I condemn these acts in the strongest possible terms. 
As Europeans and friends of Spain we are all affected. 
“I offer you and all the Spanish people as well as the families and friends of the victims my heartfelt sympathy, also on behalf of my fellow Germans. 
Our hearts go out to them, and we wish them great strength at this difficult time. 
Our thoughts are with all those who have been directly affected by this suffering. 
This appalling act and the events in Cambrils show once again the contempt for human life and the spiritual poverty of terrorism. 
Yet these acts of terrorism will not be able to destroy the openness of our society. 
Mr Gabriel, how does it feel to be here in Goslar, and not in Washington? 
It feels good. I’ve always enjoyed coming home. 
Neither Washington nor Berlin are marked. 
I’ll admit, the map is 1000 years old. 
How would you describe the situation in the world today? 
The United States, who in the past were the guarantor of this liberal order, is giving up this role. 
The shocking thing about Trump is that 
he wants to replace the strength of the law with the law of the strong. 
Is world peace under threat? 
This is because, today, all sides distrust one another. 
The Pope in Rome has a large world map on display, and at its centre is the most important city in the world – 
I’ll be interested to see what the Greens and the FDP have to say about these plans. 
What worries you the most? 
The completely ruined relationship between the United States and Russia is the greatest threat to world peace. 
Only a concerted effort by the United States and Russia can prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
What is more, 
He’s thereby producing millions of new refugees. 
Do you think Trump is mentally fit? 
That is an absurd question. 
The United States president is a focused and calculating politician. 
These people continue to staunchly support him. 
I wouldn’t bet that Trump will not remain president for eight years. 
Why did so many Americans vote for him? 
His Secretary of State once told me that last year’s election was a can-you-hear-me-now election. 
In Germany, we just had our own can-you-hear-me-now election. 
What many women face at work or during their free time is the daily reality of sexism. 
What advice do you have for him or her? 
Angelika Hellemann and Roman Eichinger 
the United States, Russia, North Korea, disarmament and arms control, as well as Europe 
But, here in Goslar, we’re as proud of our Imperial City as if it were yesterday. 
Right to the left of that, the map features Goslar. 
This means that freedom, democracy and human rights are even more threatened than they were before. 
Next week marks one year since Donald Trump was elected United States President. 
In his mind, the world is not a place in which you try to coexist peacefully and safely. 
To him, the world is an arena where people fight things out, 
where only the strong will prevail. 
It is unfortunately more than likely that new nuclear intermediate-range ballistic missiles will be stationed in the heart Europe. 
He sensed that most Americans felt they’d been left behind, and that they no longer believed what politicians told them. 
There’s another similarity. 
I am worried about a great lack of inspiration when it comes to Europe. 
Angela Merkel has no ideas for moving Europe forward. 
On the contrary, she’s failing to take up the proposals of French President Macron for closer cooperation. 
If the Federal Ministry of Finance portfolio were to go to the FDP, this would deepen the division of Europe. 
And the Greens are too weak to stop this from happening. 
For years now, this topic has been coming up again and again, for compelling reasons. 
When women resist, the mainly male response of those who’ve seen or heard such things happen is to say, 
Most of the time, small and large instances of harassment do not happen in public. 
Our liberal, Western order is in grave danger. 
Was the past year with Trump as president worse or better than expected? 
That is the opposite of the liberal world order, which the US and the West worked hard to uphold for the past 70 years. 
A new phase of global rearmament seems to be imminent. 
In Europe, and also in Germany, we are on the verge of losing everything that was achieved through the successful arms control and disarmament efforts of the 1980s and 90s. 
It is up to us Germans to finally lead a new initiative on disarmament. 
Germany must be a force for peace, and not simply pursue the armament plans Trump has made - which unfortunately is what Angela Merkel intends to do. 
If North Korea manages to acquire nuclear weapons, many others will follow suit. 
If the relationship between Washington and Moscow does not improve, our children will grow up in a dangerous, disorderly world replete with nuclear weapons. 
Trump is increasing military spending and cutting funding for development cooperation. 
He then put himself at the forefront of the anti‑establishment movement. 
With President Trump, America is governed by a an unabashed sexist. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) believes that a debate on sexism is entirely unnecessary. 
There’s clearly a need for a debate on sexism. 
“come on, get over it” or “don’t make such a fuss”. 
In addition to full investigation of the cases that are now in the public spotlight, what we need is to put an end to tolerance of everyday sexism. 
Soon, your successor who assumes office as part of the three‑way “Jamaica” coalition will have to tackle the global issues. 
The FDP’s policies are fully focused on the national economy, similar to what the AfD called for in its early days. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the firing of a missile over Riyadh 
An act of this type cannot be justified in any way. 
At the same time, this incident shows once again how urgently a political settlement is needed in the Yemen conflict. 
Minor damage was caused, but fortunately there were no casualties. 
We are very concerned to see that the ongoing fighting and attacks on civilian targets frequently claim many lives. 
The German Government thus continues to expressly support the endeavours by Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, and calls on all parties to adopt an immediate ceasefire and to conduct negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. 
The German Government nonetheless condemns this attempted attack on a civilian target in the strongest possible terms. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (6 November) on the firing of a missile over the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, for which Yemeni Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility: 
“On the evening of 4 November, Saudi Arabian air defence forces intercepted a ballistic missile close to Riyadh airport. 
“This time, we were prepared” – disaster risk reduction in Bangladesh 
Floods, cyclones and failed crops: 
That is why the Climate Change Conference in Bonn is also focusing on disaster risk reduction. 
Bangladesh is an example of what successful prevention strategies can look like. 
getting ready for monsoon season 
Bangladesh is already today confronted with the effects of climate change. 
In 2016 and 2017, heavy monsoon rains caused severe flooding in the north of the country. 
“This time, the Red Cross and Red Crescent provided assistance already before disaster struck, by warning us that floods were coming,” says Kajla Sariakandi from Sirajganj District. 
“They gave us some cash ahead of the flooding, so that we could pay transport costs for getting us to safety. 
We were also able to save our seeds and livestock in time. 
This greatly reduced the effects of the flooding for us, compared to the past years.” 
Natural disasters are becoming more and more frequent, with the annual number of disasters doubling over the past twenty years. 
People in the affected areas are then cut off from the outside world. Food supplies run short, and there is a lack of clean water. 
Displacement due to natural disasters

Bangladesh is an example of the effects of climate change on threatened populations. Recurring and ever more severe flooding during monsoon season often leads to humanitarian emergencies. 
The project includes providing small cash payments to threatened populations in areas that are affected by such crises. 
Thanks to this preventive strategy, Kajla Sariakandi was able to evacuate herself and her possessions ahead of the disaster.

For humanitarian reasons, it is therefore crucial to fight the disaster and climate-change-related causes of forced migration. At the same time, early action must be taken to mitigate humanitarian emergencies caused by forced migration. 
Moreover, Germany is campaigning for effective measures that protect people who are displaced due to natural disasters or the effects of climate change. 
Bridge-builders for Franco-German friendship: 
Adenauer-de Gaulle Prize awarded to “Berufliche Schulen Kehl”

The “Berufliche Schulen Kehl”, the jury said, were receiving the award in recognition of the various possibilities for education and training they offer for cross-border living and working on the upper Rhine. 
German students, for example, receive more intensive French lessons so that they can benefit from mobility in the Strasbourg metropolitan area. 
At the same time, there are 50 young French people attending the school just now. 
Bridge-builders and pioneers 
“We are delighted that 345 German and French students completed their cross-border training in 2016. 
But we need even more bridge-builders. 
The “Berufliche Schulen Kehl” are pioneers in this field,” stressed Roth and Loiseau. 
Young people from different backgrounds working together 
Minister of State Michael Roth at the award ceremony © Myrta Köhler 
The schools are not only helping to further Franco-German understanding: 
around a third of their students come from a migration background. 
The schools had been working with refugees on their campus since 2015. 
In October 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, the schools had made available a building for up to 150 people. 
At the same time, the teachers, with support from the communities around Kehl, had set up four “integration classes” for young refugees, offering language lessons, careers advice and help with integration. 
Franco-German jury represents social diversity in the two countries 
The Prize, which is worth 10,000 euros, was established on 22 January 1988, the 25th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty. 
It is awarded to individuals, initiatives or institutions which have made an outstanding contribution towards strengthening the Franco-German friendship. 
Humanitarian appeal: 
Foreign Minister Gabriel calls for increased funding 
Why Germany must now lead by example. 
“No one will be able to say that the international community was not adequately informed,” Gabriel said. 
On Tuesday (7 November), Gabriel held discussions with representatives of the Central Council of Yazidis in Germany. 
The situation of the Yazidis in Iraq is vivid proof of the tremendous threats and humanitarian emergencies that civilians are facing in numerous conflicts, Gabriel said after the meeting. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has called on the international community to make available the funding that is urgently needed to meet the basic needs of civilians threatened by war and hunger. 
World Food Programme forced to reduce food rations 
Gabriel emphasised that we are not only morally obligated to help these people in their dire need, but it is also crucial if we want to eliminate the causes of refugee movements. 
He underscored that other large donor countries, too, must live up to their responsibility. 
However, unlike previous years, the disastrous effects were reduced thanks to good preparation. 
Floods, storms and landslides are causing enormous damage and pose great challenges in particular to the populations of less-developed and unstable countries and regions. 
Climate change is not only increasing their frequency, but also making them more severe. 
Germany is working to promote the strengthening of disaster risk reduction strategies around the world, so that people in threatened areas are better prepared to face natural disasters. 
In Bangladesh, the Federal Foreign Office supports a project of the German Red Cross through which, based on extreme weather alerts, aid efforts get under way before natural disasters strike. 
Some of the most important present-day humanitarian challenges are displacement and forced migration due to natural disasters. 
Germany’s efforts towards disaster risk reduction 
The “Berufliche Schulen Kehl” (vocational training schools in Kehl) make an outstanding and very concrete contribution to Franco-German cooperation and to building a better Europe, emphasised Minister of State Michael Roth and French Minister for European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau. 
In the jury’s view, this is one small step towards getting young people enthusiastic about building up a shared Europe. 
The vocational schools’ work, was “an outstanding and very tangible contribution to Franco-German cooperation and to building a better Europe,” emphasised Michael Roth, Minister of State for Europe at the Federal Foreign Office, and Nathalie Loiseau, French Minister for European Affairs, at the award ceremony. 
For over 30 years, the vocational schools have maintained close cooperation with partners in France, including vocational training schools, training centres, or job and education fairs. 
In his speech at the award ceremony, Minister of State Roth said that the “Berufliche Schulen Kehl” had succeeded in teaching young people from different backgrounds to live and work together. 
The “Berufliche Schulen Kehl” were chosen to receive the Adenauer-de Gaulle Prize on the basis of a recommendation from a Franco-German jury consisting of figures from the fields of politics, culture, the media, academia and business and reflecting social diversity in France and Germany.

Germany has worked hard to have the bridge reopened. 
“All people in our country have to recognise and respect our values, rules and traditions. 
But integration is of course not a one-way street. 
This achievement also gave grounds for hope that further agreements would be reached in the coming months. 
The discussions are also to focus on integration obstacles and how to overcome them. 
The situation is particularly dramatic in Syria, as well as in trouble spots on the African continent. 
In recent years, Germany has repeatedly sharply increased its spending on humanitarian aid. 
We need to make sure that you can be different without being fearful. 
In a nutshell, 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel speaks to the press © C. Gärtner/Photothek

Minister of State Roth underscored: 
The international community is providing not even half of the funding needed for humanitarian aid around the world. 
Foto mit Bildunterschrift: 
According to the United Nations, donor pledges are meeting less than 50 percent of the current need for aid in the world’s many crisis regions. 
Due to a lack of funds, the World Food Programme has for example been forced to reduce food rations by 30 percent to Somali refugees in Kenya. 
Germany has increased its aid – others must do the same 
Altogether, Germany currently provides more than 1.5 billion euros in aid to help meet the urgent needs of people around the world. 
Gabriel pointed out that, to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, for example, Germany must even further increase its humanitarian funding.

Gura Bicului-Bychok Bridge between Moldova and Transdniestria to be reopened 
The bridge is now due to be reopened, thus marking progress in the frozen Transdniestria conflict. 
The village of Gura Bicului is situated on the western banks of the river. Bychok village is on the eastern side. 
As the crow flies, it is only two kilometres from one village to the other, but the journey currently takes almost 40 minutes by car 
“One of the strengths of the Franco-German Integration Council is that it can openly and critically combine different perspectives. 
Recommendations for the Franco-German Council of Ministers 
The establishment of the Franco-German Integration Council was agreed in May 2017 to increase cooperation in the spheres of integration and social cohesion. 
The Integration Council is to meet at least once a year in the run-up to the Franco-German Council of Ministers. 
Working to reopen the bridge – 
Ambassador Wolf-Dietrich Heim of Austria, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for the Transdniestrian Settlement Process, said this was “good news for the local population on both sides of the river”. 
The reopening of the bridge would not only improve connectivity between people and enhance trade, but could also help to build confidence between the sides. 
The narrow River Dniester/Nistru separates the breakaway region of Transdniestria from the Republic of Moldova. 
As a rule, integration begins with learning the language of the new country. 
They need to learn German. 
It does not just impose an obligation on migrants to put down roots here without having to completely give up their identity. The majority population also needs to open up and change,” Roth emphasised. 
As much diversity as possible, as much common ground as necessary 
“Germany and France have a long tradition as countries of immigration. 
Europe is a migration continent. 
as much diversity as possible, as much common ground as necessary,” as Minister of State Roth said after the meeting. 
Promoting social cohesion, accommodation and urban policy questions are also to be discussed. 
Taking off the blinkers 
The Gura Bicului-Bychok Bridge was destroyed in 1992 during the fighting between the Republic of Moldova and the Transdniestria region and subsequently repaired with the help of EU funding. 
as a result of the Transdniestria conflict. The bridge linking the two villages was destroyed in 1992 and has not been used since then. 
Following mediation by the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE), it has now been agreed that the Gura Bicului-Bychok Bridge will be reopened. 
The bridge was repaired as far back as 2001, but security concerns arising from the tense situation have prevented it from being opened to cars and pedestrians so far. 
Endeavours under Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship to reopen the bridge 
In 2016, then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE, and in this capacity he launched efforts to reopen the bridge.

that is, a conflict in which there is no acute fighting, but also no long‑term solution. 
The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a de facto separation of Transdniestria from the Republic of Moldova. However, its unilateral declaration of independence has not been recognised by any country in the world. 
Apart from the Republic of Moldova and Transdniestria, the 5+2 talks include Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE as a facilitator and the European Union and United States as observers. 
As chair, Minister of State Michael Roth thus focused discussions on teaching language skills and values at the first meeting of the Integration Council. 
With the Franco-German Integration Council, the two countries want to promote a Europe of diversity. 
However, we need to make clear what we need for peaceful, respectful and successful co-existence in our societies. 
Key points on the agenda in the next three years include education and equal opportunities, integration into the labour market, as well as combating discrimination and radicalisation. 
Only if we take off the blinkers and look beyond our national borders will we be able to promote European solutions. 
On 13 July 2017, the four co-chairs met in Paris on the fringes of the 19th Franco-German Council of Ministers for the first time to draw up plans for the first meeting in Berlin. 
Teaching language skills and values was in the spotlight at the first meeting of the Franco-German Integration Council which took place on Tuesday (7 November) in Berlin and was co-chaired by the German and French Interior Ministers, Thomas de Maizière and Gérard Collomb, and the Commissioners for Franco-German Cooperation, Michael Roth and Nathalie Loiseau. 
And we urgently need momentum for European solutions in order to finally put Europe’s duty to demonstrate solidarity into practice.” 
Promoting a Europe of diversity: 
Those who don’t use their integration opportunities, those who don’t engage in training, those who don’t want to work here cannot be part of our society. 
The Franco-German Integration Council is to facilitate exchange of the different experiences in the two countries concerning the integration of migrants, identify successful strategies and provide impetus for European cooperation. 
The results of the Council’s work are to be presented in the Council of Ministers in the form of recommendations.

The conference raises Germany’s international profile as a location for research and innovation. 
Questions for the future 
How will people interact with robots in the future? 
How is synthetic biology helping to revolutionise medicine? 
What does sustainable help for refugees need to entail? 
because open-mindedness, international exchange, contacts and connectivity are the prerequisites for overcoming global challenges together and enhancing academic excellence through worldwide, interdisciplinary cooperation. 
In order to answer these questions, the Falling Walls Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Berlin, holds the International Conference on Future Breakthroughs in Science and Society on 9 November every year, the day when the Berlin Wall fell. 
The Federal Foreign Office supports the Falling Walls Conference 
The conference is attended by pioneers and decision-makers in the fields of science, politics, business and culture from all over the world who take part in discussions and present scientific breakthroughs that could be of crucial importance for the future and prosperity of the world.

Academics, talented people and decision-makers from all over the world attend the Falling Walls Conference 
These are three of the topics being presented at the Falling Walls Conference on 9 November by 20 of the most influential leading researchers in the world. 
Address by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the panel discussion titled “Dialogue between the descendants of perpetrators and victims of National Socialism” 
However, the process of dealing with this history does not go back to the early days of the Federal Republic. 
Bauer, who at the time was the Chief Public Prosecutor in Land Hesse, had to fight and overcome great obstacles to even place National Socialist perpetrators under arrest. 
Since the 1960s, and of course also as part of the student movement, we have developed ways to remember the National Socialists and their crimes, the things that people are capable of doing to other people. 
At my school, there was great controversy over whether or not we should view 8 May 1945 as liberation day. 
The official stance was that it was the day of defeat. 
Germany can only use its innovative strength effectively if it is integrated in international knowledge flows and value-added chains. 
I have been confronted with how difficult this is several times during my political career. 
Until the mid-1980s, hundreds of former members of the SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler gathered for meetings in Bad Harzburg. 
The news agency was founded in 1990 and is regarded as the only largely independent media outlet in Azerbaijan. 
I welcome the decision by the Azerbaijani public prosecution office and encourage the Azerbaijani Government to abide by the commitments it has made as regards freedom of the press and freedom of expression. 
I will continue to follow the situation regarding freedom of the press in Azerbaijan closely. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (9 November) on the dropping of the charges against Mehman Aliyev, director of the Azerbaijani news agency Turan: 
“I was very relieved to hear that the charges against Mehman Aliyev, director of the independent news agency Turan, have been dropped. 
The main charges involved the alleged illegal acquisition of foreign funding between 2010 and 2014, as well as alleged tax evasion between 2010 and 2016. 
The Nazi crimes and war atrocities that were perpetrated during the next six years left traces across Europe and far beyond, impacting societies and individual families. It is nothing short of a miracle that our country experienced the merciful treatment of being invited to return to the fold of the world’s civilised nations only a relatively short time after these crimes were committed. 
So it is a great miracle that we were extended an invitation after all of these crimes. 
This is not about perpetuating guilt complexes – there’s no way that young people would be receptive to this. 
I think it is truly disgraceful that our country has still not managed to bring the perpetrators, or at least those who are still alive, to justice. 
It is important that the public prosecution office in Frankfurt am Main has brought charges against a man who is now 96 years old for being an accessory to murder. 
Researchers’ current estimate of the number of perpetrators who were involved in the Holocaust is a total of between 200,000 and 250,000 German and Austrian citizens. 
In addition, there are the many people who were directly or indirectly involved in Nazi crimes, as well as the foreign collaborators in both Eastern and Western Europe. 
Thank goodness, there is today wide consensus on who the victims and persecuted individuals were. 
Six million Jewish women and men were murdered. 
To this day, we cannot imagine the industrial machinery of destruction that perpetrated this mass murder. 
Just as unfathomable is the amount of life and humanity that were lost. 
Then, there is the irreparable damage that was done to culture and society. 
Altogether, the Second World War created an unparalleled fracture in history. 
In 1945, nothing was the same. 
I did not know how much Nazi literature exists in Germany. 
It was only while sorting through his belongings that I gained a glimpse of this. 
In Germany, if you were a civil servant in the postal service with a permanent contract, a postman, you could be fired for being a member of the German Communist Party. 
But the example of my father shows that being a dyed-in-the-wool National Socialist did not prevent a person from being appointed, and remaining, a lifetime German civil servant, which included a full pension. 
The grandmother of my eldest daughter was one of the victims of Mengele. We discovered this during a visit to Yad Vashem. 
People who denied Auschwitz and people who died there – all in the same family. 
Of course, there have been fundamental changes since the time that followed the Auschwitz trials. 
That was the first time he considered hanging himself. 
But there is even more to consider, because our entire society is changing. 
“What does that have to do with us? 
Our parents come from Turkey, Morocco and Syria. 
We must get people to identify more with this country, beyond simply holding a German passport. 
This is, after all, not just any country. 
Not only with regard to National Socialism. 
That’s why this is such a challenging task. 
It resurrects the idea of eugenics. 
Both of you, Ms Granzow-Rauwald and Mr Gantz, have thoroughly researched your own family histories and have examined its effects on your own lives. You are knowledgeable about precisely how society tries to come to grips with the past, and your knowledge is based on very personal experience, or at least on the experiences of your own families. 
“This is an hour of grace for the young generation, wherever they may be. That they may remember, and never forget, that they should know what took place, and that they never, absolutely never, have the slightest doubt in their minds that there is another option, other than peace, reconciliation and love.” With these words, the highest representative of a people that Germany had set out to exterminate says in Germany, in the German Bundestag, that our greatest aim should be not only peace and reconciliation, but mutual love. 
I wish you all the best! 
Apart from the major war criminals – who were soon brought to trial by the Allies and, incidentally, released just as quickly because, it appears, the consensus at the time was that they were needed – identification of individuals as perpetrators always depends on the historical, political and social context, and the process of answering these questions is still ongoing. 
Thank you very much for this invitation, and for your kind words of welcome! 
The history of the Federal Foreign Office during the period of National Socialism has been presented in this space. 
Our critical assessment of National Socialism and of the Germans’ role as citizens, active participants, people who simply toed the line, and perpetrators did not begin in earnest until the Auschwitz trials were held in Frankfurt from 1963 to 1965. 
Remembering the conditions under which this could occur is meanwhile part of our national ethos in Germany. 
Addressing this topic in school, in academic research, in our relations with neighbouring countries, and on television – all this has meanwhile become possible. 
Every 27th of January in the German Bundestag, we hold a commemoration to mark the day that Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated. 
We were a group of young people, and even though it was 1978 we were put under surveillance by the state security service – as if this were a revolutionary act that posed a threat to the Federal Republic of Germany! 
The victims’ birth dates were marked with a star, and their presumed dates of death with a cross. 
This caused the last surviving Jewish citizens who attended the unveiling to faint. 
For years, I have suggested that my home town replace this commemorative inscription. 
This did not change until 1985, when the great Federal President Richard von Weizacker delivered his historic speech. 
During my school days, at least at my intermediate school, our history lessons stopped just before the outbreak of the First World War. This had something to do with our history teacher’s political views. 
Right now, we are witnessing that, in our country’s political culture, an elected representative can call for a complete reversal of Germany’s culture of remembrance. 
What could this actually mean – other than no longer wanting to remember! 
Even in post-World-War-Two Germany, the group maintained strict discipline: the troops stayed in one hotel, while non-commissioned officers stayed in another and officers in a third. 
We were the ones who, in the eyes of many, were disturbing the peace by voicing our outrage at the fact that a criminal organisation had permission to meet in Germany. 
How were my parents, my grandparents, or in some cases my great grandparents, involved? What was their role, and what were their experiences? 
I do not imagine this was very popular in France, Belgium, Italy or the Netherlands. 
Yet it is also every single generation’s great responsibility to engage in remembrance, for that very reason. 
I was pleased to accept it, because I admit that, to me, this topic is not only of political, but also of strong personal interest. 
Let me wish you all a very warm welcome to the Federal Foreign Office and to our library reading room. 
We’ve admittedly had some time in Germany to look into how the perpetrators and victims have been dealt with, which includes the history of all those who are children of the perpetrators and of the victims, and that of apparently uninvolved individuals. 
Anyone who wanted to get an impression of how difficult these efforts were in the early years, in a society that was happy to repress all of its memories and fully concentrate on rebuilding the country, could watch one of the films that have been made about Fritz Bauer. 
All these years, we have indeed faced opposition, and there has always been controversy. 
We don’t need to go back as far as the famous debate about drawing a line under the past that has resurfaced time and again in Germany. 
The controversy is far from over. 
I can still recall how, as a young man, I participated in a demonstration in 1978 in my home town of Goslar that called for the opening of our still-preserved Jewish cemetery that dates back to the late Middle Ages. 
Ten years later, in 1988, my home town put up the first plaque commemorating our Jewish fellow citizens who were deported to Auschwitz. 
The plaque showed how little thought had gone into it. 
To this day, this mistake – the incompetence, and the refusal to confront the past it signified – is on full display. 
It also shows how, even in a country that since the 1970s can be proud of how it confronts its past, this topic is not without controversy, and certainly not a simple matter. 
Everything to do with remembrance can cause controversy, particularly because a country of perpetrators is always also a country of victims. 
In what ways can the gassing of people in Chelmno extermination camp, the mass shootings at Babyn Yar, the starvation of thousands of Greeks, and of Russians who were citizens of the former Soviet Union, and the Nazi euthanasia experiments be relevant for us today, for each and every one of us? 
The Second World War ended 72 years ago, at a time when the children who examine this question today were not even born. 
Although this question concerns many, it is only natural that, as time passes, the way we confront the past and in some cases the roles that distant relatives played is different than if we are talking about the generation of our fathers and mothers. 
After all, when the Second World War was unleashed in 1939, it was not from a nondescript place, but from National Socialist Germany. 
I am still impressed that Europeans whose countries the pillaging and murderous Germans had recently passed through invited us soon after the end of World War Two to co-found the European Union. 
Those were brave people who wanted Germany to help establish this European Union. Sometimes, Germans need to be reminded of how courageous others were to include Germany in efforts to establish Europe. 
But we must keep an awareness of this responsibility alive, not just in theory, but through our activities, ranging from our political efforts to the work of associations, and extending into the daily life of our families and our everyday interactions. 
There have been countless discussions, dismissals and renewed discussions about whether or not Germany is a land of perpetrators, or whether all German people are perpetrators, and of whether or not collective guilt exists. 
The search for perpetrators, and the work to identify them, justifiably continues. 
Of course, regardless of the judgement, this man will no longer receive just punishment during his remaining lifetime for the crimes he is being accused of. 
The Independent Commission of Historians presented its report, titled Das Amt und die Vergangenheit (The German Foreign Office and the Nazi Past), here in this reading room in 2012. 
The expulsions, the expropriation and the destruction of property and identity. 
What this meant for families, I truly witnessed for myself. 
At the age of 16, I discovered that my father was a National Socialist – which he remained up to the very end of his life when he died three years ago. 
There probably isn’t a single brochure that he didn’t subscribe to and send to other people. 
Incidentally, his employment as a civil servant was tolerated, and he remained employed up to his retirement. 
At the same time, I have a daughter whose grandfather was Jewish. 
Although her grandfather later converted to Catholicism, he did come from a Jewish family, and you can still see the family’s gravestones here at the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee. 
Only one generation is not buried there – because it was put on the last train that left Berlin, the so-called factory transport, destined for Auschwitz. 
You can imagine that this is a lot to think about, and that one must find a way to deal with it. 
That’s why, for me, this topic is truly very personal, and it’s why I’m glad that we now have an opportunity to talk about the ways in which the present-day context of remembrance has changed. 
During my first visit to the Auschwitz memorial site with Action Reconciliation - Service for Peace, I was at least still able to speak with a prisoner who was interned for being a Social Democrat and who came from my own home town. 
By the way, this man thought of committing suicide only once, namely when he reached retirement and wanted to apply for his pension. This included the significant number of years of internment, from 1936 to 1945. 
The civil servant asked him to prove that there were not good grounds for his being held at Auschwitz. 
He would actually have had to file charges in Germany to get these years credited towards his pension. 
The people who witnessed both the mass murder and how the new Federal Republic dealt with it will soon no longer be with us. 
Today, people who live in Germany originate from around the world. 
Some of them grew up in countries where since their earliest days they have been indoctrinated with anti-Semitism. 
So if we manage to get pupils to tell us what they truly think, and if they do not remain silent out of fear to upset those in authority, some will say: 
Why do we bear responsibility for this chapter of German history?” In a society that has been shaped by migration, we must also examine this issue from an entirely different angle. 
It is a country in its own right, with certain ideas about how we live together, with an identity that has grown out of our Basic Law. 
The roots of this Basic Law indeed extend back to the time of National Socialism and to the Weimar Republic. 
I remember that, during my time as SPD Chairman, Thilo Sarrazin published his book titled Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany does away with itself). 
It contains the astonishing statement that eugenics was very popular in the first half of the 20th century, and the author cannot understand why this is no longer the case in the second half of the 20th century. 
The true meaning of these words was noticed only by Frank Schirmmacher, the publisher of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, who unfortunately died before his time. 
The Neuengamme concentration camp memorial leads the way in this effort – at it, you have established direct ties between the descendants of perpetrators and victims. 
I wish you great strength as you continue your work, by meeting ever new challenges and working to ensure that, in Germany, we never develop a culture in which this topic becomes taboo. 
Neuengamme memorial thereby also makes Shimon Peres’ vision a reality, who in 2010 in his address to the German Bundestag on International Holocaust Remembrance Day expressed the following wish: 
To this day, this understandably makes us feel ashamed, because several decades ago we probably could not have imagined making similar statements. 
Working together to tackle pandemics: 
Mobile laboratory handed over to Tunisia 
Dangerous diseases know no boundaries. 
That is why Germany is helping countries all over the world to minimise biological risks. 
Everything needs to go like clockwork: 
Tunisian experts undergoing training at the laboratory 
This is a milestone in the fight against pandemics and the spread of chemical warfare agents: 
If there is a danger from highly infectious pathogens, the Tunisian authorities will now be able to rapidly analyse the risk and respond in the proper manner. 
Increased security only through cooperation 
Biological risks do not stop at national borders. 
Minister of State Böhmer to travel to Turkey 
The Minister of State will also discuss the situation of refugees in Turkey with representatives of the UN aid organisations. 
Statement by Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the dropping of the charges against Mehman Aliyev in Azerbaijan 
The investigation against Azerbaijani news agency Turan and its director Mehman Aliyev was launched in early August 2017. 
Aliyev was arrested on 25 August and accused of illegal business activities, tax evasion and abuse of office. 
He was conditionally released on 11 September. However, the investigation against him and the agency continued. 
On 2 November, the General Prosecutor's Office informed Aliyev that the case against him had been closed in a ruling on 30 October. 
The budgets for the individual peace missions are each passed separately for one year, running from July to the following June. 
The main events during her time in Istanbul will be a visit to the Turkish-German University and a meeting with businesspeople. 
However, because the final budgets for UNAMID and MINUJUSTH are currently being negotiated, the total amount is expected to increase to 7.3 billion US dollars. 
That is why Germany is providing over 18 million euros to help partners such as Tunisia to minimise biological security risks. 
Good cooperation: 
“Decision-makers and experts from various fields must work together seamlessly to minimise risks and, if necessary, provide an effective response,” said German Ambassador Andreas Reinicke at the laboratory handover. 
Ambassador Andreas Reinicke (l) at the handover 
“The focal point of activities in Tunisia is to train experts from the military, the police force and healthcare institutions. 
They are trained in how to diagnose highly infectious pathogens quickly and correctly and how to prevent their spread.” Using their newly acquired knowledge, these experts then act as multipliers in their respective institutions. 
Comprehensive engagement for biosecurity 
Minister of State Böhmer will be travelling to Turkey from 12 to 14 November 2017 for political talks and for meetings with representatives of the business community and civil society. 
In Ankara Minister of State Böhmer will meet the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Yıldız, the chair of the Human Rights Committee, Mustafa Yeneroğlu, and AKP deputy and former Minister of Youth and Sports, Akif Çağatay Kılıç. 
First and foremost, she will be talking about the Turkish Government’s measures to integrate the refugees, but also about the situation for refugees on the job market and education opportunities for refugee children and young people. 
As chair of the advisory board of Kulturakademie Tarabya, Minister of State Böhmer will also be meeting fellowship holders. 
The Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology is working with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in Tunisia. 
Enable and Enhance Initiative: 
Information on the German Biosecurity Programme 
If biological warfare agents are used, or highly infectious pathogens cause a global pandemic, the dangers can only be tackled via cross-border cooperation. 
In order to ensure comprehensive biosecurity, however, cooperation needs to be both cross-border and cross-sectoral. 
Lieutenant General Dr Michael Tempel, Surgeon General of the Federal Armed Forces, emphasised that this approach was already being put into practice in the German-Tunisian partnership, telling the audience at the handover: 
The German project partners, too, espouse this intersectoral approach. 
In turn, their project is part of a larger-scale engagement within the framework of the German Government’s Enable and Enhance Initiative. 
Within the framework of this initiative, the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry of Defence coordinate closely and initiate projects with partners worldwide. 
The aim is always to enable selected partners to take even more responsibility in response to regional threats. 
In addition, Tunisia is a priority partner country for the German Biosecurity Programme. 
The programme activities help to reduce biological risks and the related danger of proliferation. 
on Thursday (9 November), Germany handed over a state‑of‑the‑art mobile laboratory to Tunisia. 
This programme was launched by the Federal Foreign Office in 2013 and is currently active in 12 countries. 
It shows how time and again, some people are in denial, and how new interpretations could become socially accepted if there were no debate in our society on this issue. 
At the time, people saw that their very life depended on it – because they knew, as Francois Mitterand would later point out, that nationalism always meant war. 
Moreover, the question of who is a perpetrator is far from resolved. 
60 million people were killed during the Second World War – an unfathomable number, and it should be said that half of them were civilians. 
We will have less and less opportunities to refer to authentic reports by living perpetrators and victims. 
The general public took it to be a legitimately expressed opinion, even though the entire Basic Law was written to prevent any linkage between social issues and genetics. The framers of our Basic Law did this because they had the Nuremberg trial of the concentration camp doctors. 
That is why I think Shimon Peres’ wish is something all of us should feel obligated to fulfil. I am most grateful for the brilliant project that has been presented to us here today. I hope you will have an interesting and also engaging and thoughtful evening. 
The Federal Foreign Office answered the question of what role diplomats played in Nazi Germany very late. 
Transatlantic Coordinator travels to New York 
My trip also gives me the opportunity to continue talks with civil society organisations who are dedicated to transatlantic cooperation. 
This includes the renowned Leo Baeck Institute which researches and documents the history and culture of German-speaking Jews. 
Jürgen Hardt has been a Member of the German Bundestag since 2009. 
On Monday (13 November), the Foreign Affairs Council finally officially launched the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). 
“A major step for European independence” 
As Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation, I have the job of seeking out opportunities for such discussions, explaining German and European positions and advocating close transatlantic coordination on central issues.

The Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation, Jürgen Hardt, is travelling to New York today (14 November) for talks. 
Ahead of his departure, Jürgen Hardt issued the following statement: 
Despite the uncertainty about the US President’s foreign policy course, there are numerous challenges in which Germany and the United States must pull in the same direction, such as the nuclear agreement with Iran, dealing with North Korea or sanctions against Russia. 
We also need to maintain our dialogue on climate policy and trade issues. 
He is Foreign Affairs Spokesman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and has been Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation in the Federal Foreign Office since April 2014. 
The Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation 
In future, 23 EU member states wish to interact closely in the area of security and defence policy. At the Foreign Affairs Council they handed over the official joint notification of the Permanent Structured Cooperation to Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. 
The common security and defence policy has been a central issue since the European integration project began. 
Today’s statement is a sign of decisive progress for the common European policy. 
Speaking in Brussels, German Foreign Minister Gabriel stressed, “The Permanent Structured Cooperation is a major step for European independence and towards strengthening the European security and defence policy.” 
“After all, it is no longer national, but European security that is at stake,” Gabriel declared in the run‑up to the Foreign Affairs Council. 
The total amount the EU spends on security and defence is similar to that spent by the United States, but it is only 15 per cent as efficient. 
Gabriel summed up: “A European Union that pools its resources wisely and is able to use the combined power of 27 member states is in a better position to protect its people.” 
“we can only achieve true stability and security if at the same time we also strengthen civilian crisis management, so that the EU can respond to crises in its neighbourhood more quickly and effectively with civilian means.” 
For example, a European logistics centre to support crisis operations and a European officer training course are under discussion. 
All European Union member states support the establishment of the Permanent Structured Cooperation, with 23 states so far having expressed their desire to participate.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel travels to Italy 
Germany and Italy: bilateral relations 
The focus will be on European and international issues. 
On 14 and 15 November, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will be in Rome, where he will hold bilateral talks with his Italian counterpart Angelino Alfano. 
After their meeting, the two foreign ministers plan to give a joint press conference. 
To mark the establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and the Order of Malta, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will also meet with the Grand Chancellor of the Sovereign Order of Malta, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is travelling to Rome on Wednesday (15 November), 
where he will meet representatives of the Order of Malta and Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano. 
Diplomatic relations with the Order of Malta 
Enhancing humanitarian work 
The Order of Malta is also an important partner organisation for German humanitarian assistance. 
Be it in Syria, northern Iraq, many parts of Africa and Asia, or during the major natural disasters of recent years, Germany and the Order of Malta work closely together around the world. 
Both Presidents will then visit the Orthodox synagogue in Žilina. 
Gabriel will also meet his Italian counterpart Angelino Alfano in Rome. 
He will meet Slovak President Andrej Kiska for political talks in Bratislava during his official visit. 
Meeting with Alfano – focus on EU issues 
Germany maintains diplomatic relations with almost 200 countries and also has ambassadors to international organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations. 
It has now established diplomatic relations with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. 
The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta – abbreviated as the Order of Malta – 
was founded in 1113 and is recognised as a subject of international law. 
Following a long and varied history, the Order now primarily plays an important role in humanitarian assistance with some 120,000 people around the world active in its charitable projects, looking after sick people, caring for the elderly and helping refugees. 
The establishment of diplomatic relations pays tribute to the Order of Malta’s humanitarian endeavours. The aim is to enhance this work in the future. 
Their talks will focus on current EU issues, 
including the refugee situation, migration, the EU’s Brexit negotiations with the UK and the future of the European Union. 
Germany tops the Nation Brands Index 
Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (16 November): 
I am pleased that Germany is held in such high regard around the world. 
People around the world vest their trust in us. 
So I am especially delighted that France is also high up on the list in the eyes of the world. 
After topping the table in 2014, Germany ranked second in 2015 and 2016. 
In the field of governance, Germany ranks fourth after Canada, Switzerland and Sweden. 
The Anholt-GfK Nation Brands Index developed by Simon Anholt and carried out in collaboration with the company GfK Public Communications and Social Science is an international survey on the image of 50 countries. 
The results of this latest survey are again the proof. 
For some time now, Germany’s image hasn’t simply been based on our economic clout. 
With our global engagement, we are trying to live up to these expectations and shoulder responsibility – always together with our European partners. 
With constant high scores in five of the six categories, Germany’s positive image is broad-based. 
Germany was awarded higher scores in all categories compared to last year and went up to second place in the category Investment & Immigration. 
German products and the employability of Germans are ranked highest in the world. 
The culture of welcome and the attractiveness of the landscape are the weakest indicators in Germany’s profile. 
In 20 countries, a thousand adults post online their personal assessment of the nations surveyed, in six different categories:

A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (15 November) in response to the declaration by the Government of the Region of Kurdistan-Iraq that it would respect the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court’s decision of 6 November: 
This is important because it signals an openness to dialogue. 
Their talks will focus on EU and international issues. 
Their talks will focus on the situation in Lebanon and the region, as well as on bilateral topics. 
Germany and Lebanon: bilateral relations 
Only if all stakeholders make a concerted effort, and if the unity of the country and its constitutional order are maintained, will Iraq be able to meet the great challenges it is facing.

It is now up to the Government in Baghdad to make use of this opportunity and to begin, as soon as possible, to resolve the political disputes. 
On 14 November, the Kurdistan Regional Government declared that it would respect the decision of the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court confirming the interpretation of Article 1 of the Iraqi Constitution, which states that independence of Iraqi regions is not provided for by the Constitution. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel before leaving for Belarus 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (17 November) before flying to Minsk: 
I am looking forward to attending the ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Minsk Forum and supporting dialogue between Germans and Belarusians. 
People sometimes forget that 
Belarus is a country at the heart of Europe. 
We want to have stronger and better relations with this country. 
Of course we see that there has to be more progress in the field of democracy and human rights. 
This is something I will address in talks with my interlocutors in Minsk. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will travel to Belarus tomorrow (17 November) to attend the Minsk Forum, which is marking its twentieth anniversary this year. 
He will also hold political talks with Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei and President Alexander Lukashenko. 
The agenda for their talks will include bilateral relations, cooperation on international crises such as the Russia‑Ukraine conflict and the human rights situation in Belarus. 
With a view to the EU summit with the Eastern Partnership countries next week, talks will also focus on the possibility of closer relations between Belarus and the EU. 
This has been difficult on occasion in the past and it won't always be easy in the future either. 
But over the last two years, the EU and Belarus have taken cautious steps to move closer together. 
We want to continue supporting this process, particularly in the run-up to the EU’s Eastern Partnership Summit next week. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel received his Lebanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, for talks in Berlin on Thursday (16 November).

As one of Syria’s direct neighbours, Lebanon has been doing its utmost to help the people who have fled the civil war. 
Now the country risks being destabilised by tensions between neighbouring powers. 
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Gabriel assured his Lebanese counterpart of Germany’s support. 
“Germany stands firmly by Lebanon’s side,” Gabriel said, 
He further remarked that Germany and Europe owed Lebanon a debt of gratitude for its tremendous exertions to help Syrian refugees. 
Following his meeting with Foreign Minister Bassil, Gabriel said that Europe now had to convey a joint message of support for Lebanon. 
Gabriel calls for calm and rationality

In view of the crisis sparked by the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri, Gabriel assured him that his country could count on Germany’s support. 
As he said, “Another trouble spot is the last thing that people in the Middle East need now.” 
Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in a surprise announcement during a visit to Saudi Arabia.

Lebanon is currently in the throes of a political crisis. 
People in Lebanon are growing ever more concerned that his resignation could upset the balance of power between the various ethnic and religious groups in the country. 
The country has taken in more than a million Syrians – a huge number given the size of the country. If Germany were to take in as many per capita, it would have to take in 20 million! 
The wars of tomorrow will probably be fought first and foremost by robots and drones.

Lengthy negotiations expected 
UN Office in Geneva: 
All decisions taken by the States Parties in this forum must be reached by consensus. 
Germany as a pioneer 
Since 2014, Germany has made a major contribution to the international discourse during informal consultations on LAWS. 
Consultations are taking place at the UN Office in Geneva as part of the mandate of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).

Gabriel calls for progress in the area of human rights

The existence of such weapons would fundamentally change the warfare of tomorrow. 
In the face of rapid progress made in research, the international community must already consider its response to LAWS today. 
Together, both delegations advocate a clear commitment to applicable international law and to the requirement for future weapons systems to be controlled by humans. 
As confidence-building measures, Germany and France have proposed a close exchange of information between countries in the development of future weapons systems, as well as the establishment of a group of technical experts to update States Parties on relevant technical developments. 
Germany held the chairmanship in the Geneva working groups on LAWS in 2015 and 2016. 
Killer robots, swarms of deadly mini drones, unmanned submarines controlled by autonomous technology – such lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) could soon be a reality thanks to rapid progress in research into robotics and artificial intelligence. 
Belarus is the only country on the European continent that still imposes the death penalty.

There are signs that the negotiation process is shaping up to be long and difficult. 
Host for negotiations on Ukraine 
While a number of countries see no need to regulate this area whatsoever at the present time, a group of countries is calling for an immediate ban to the development of autonomous weapons. 
Calling for progress on human rights and democracy:

The proposal tabled by France and Germany could, as a third way, represent a viable solution for a large number of countries. 
Alongside the States Parties, numerous civil society representatives, including the initiators of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, are taking part in the consultations. 
What you just saw – this huge area of temporary buildings – was set up in the last two months alone. 
The international community cannot just stand still. 
Secondly, we need to do everything we can with the Government in Myanmar to ensure that people can return. 
Press conference with Gebran Bassil, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lebanon, on 16 November 
That’s why it’s extremely important to do several things. 
Firstly, we need to ensure that people receive enough support. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel visits Kutupalong refugee camp 
“Obviously, you can see that the people who have come here are living in dire conditions. 
The international community is doing a lot here, but Bangladesh in particular is doing a huge amount to help. 
Germany is supporting Bangladesh to the tune of 20 million euros 
The country has a key role to play in resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
The Foreign Minister stressed that Belarus could be an important bridge for Europe. 
Gabriel will also attend the ASEM Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. 
Visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp 
Grasping opportunities for closer ties: 
Many people in the region are day labourers and are now worried about being pushed out of the market. 
Speaking in Minsk, Gabriel declared: “We want to support the tentative steps towards closer ties between Belarus and the EU.” 
In recent years, the Belarusian Government has shown increasing willingness to hold talks with the EU, among other things by entering into a human rights dialogue with the European Union. 
We have a great interest in the country’s unity and stability. 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with Lebanon, and with all those who want to maintain the unity and stability of the country. 
In Minsk, Gabriel emphasised that progress in the area of democracy and human rights was necessary for closer ties with the EU to be established. 
The Rohingya are a Muslim minority. 
Together with the European Union, Germany is calling for a moratorium on capital punishment at least, and is appealing to Belarus to place a stronger focus on civil rights and the rule of law. 
Gabriel highlighted the responsibility that the country had assumed in hosting the meetings of the OSCE’s Trilateral Contact Group. 
The conference, which focuses on the relationship between Belarus and its neighbours, Germany and the EU, celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. 
International support 
We call on all political actors in the region to address this conflict in a prudent and circumspect way. 
Raqqa: 
A political solution for Syria is still a long way off. 
Germany is providing funding for mine clearance in the devastated Syrian city of Raqqa. 
Political dialogue 
International support is an important first step. 
Deadly legacy of tyranny 
For almost four years Raqqa was subject to the IS reign of terror. 
Before abandoning the city, the terrorist militia left behind a deadly legacy. 
Perfidious booby-traps have been planted throughout the city: 
triggered by the tiniest movement, tripwires and primed everyday objects such as toys or books blow up explosive charges. 
Entering and moving around in the city therefore brings deadly risks for the civilian population and humanitarian aid workers. 
Did President Macron’s invitation to Hariri include his family? 
The destroyed city needs help 
But reconstruction is urgently needed. 
support for closer ties and greater openness 
Hospitals, schools and the water supply have all been destroyed. 
The people still living in Raqqa are cut off from all sources of help. 
At the same time, the first families are already returning to the city. 
Rapid aid from Germany 
If not, is there not a risk he can be blackmailed? 
Since the end of August, Bangladesh has taken in more than 600,000 Rohingya fleeing from the province of Rakhine in neighbouring Myanmar, many of whom are living in the refugee camp in Kutupalong. 
Morukc Umnaber/dpa | worldwide use, © dpa 
The city, devastated by IS, is still riddled with deathly traps. 
The Federal Foreign Office is making available ten million euros so that reconstruction work can begin. 
Moreover, discussions must be held concerning the conditions under which the Rohingya can live in Myanmar. 
After his visit to Bangladesh, Gabriel will travel onwards to Myanmar. 
Germany has therefore decided to act quickly. 
We are of course also witnessing a human tragedy in Yemen, which is a war that is not coming to an end, also because it is a proxy war. 
The Federal Foreign Office is making available ten million euros so that specialists can rid the city of the omnipresent danger as soon as possible. 
Returning families need to know that an orderly life is possible after IS and that there are prospects for stable development. 
The Rohingya crisis: 
The helicopter flight over the camp takes a whole five minutes. More than 800,000 Rohingya live here in temporary buildings. On his trip to Bangladesh, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel pledged a further 20 million euros of aid for the Kutupalong refugee camp. 
While Bangladesh’s willingness to help is overwhelming, the country is reaching its limits. 
As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, it continues to suffer from the impact of severe flooding. 
Not only is the security situation tense, but Bangladesh numbers among the world’s poorest nations. 
Germany has also long supported the Rohingya and has now reaffirmed its support for Bangladesh. 
The Foreign Minister’s trip was also a reflection of the international community’s support in this crisis. 
At the same time, the dialogue must be pursued at the political level, said Gabriel. 
Third, I think – and I discussed this some time ago with the German Federal Chancellor – that Syria’s two neighbouring countries, Lebanon and Jordan, although they are very different and not suitable for comparison, that these countries need economic support. 
Together with the Government in Myanmar, everything must now be done to allow the Rohingya to return, he added. 
This is a refugee crisis that has only recently become a focus of international attention. 
They are not recognised as citizens in Myanmar with its majority Buddhist population, and there have been multiple waves of expulsion. 
Many Rohingya have sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh, where around 400,000 Rohingya already lived prior to the current crisis. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel opens the exhibition “The American Dream” 
In this context, he issued the following statement today in Berlin: 
The transatlantic relationship is currently undergoing a phase of readjustment. 
Germany is helping with mine clearance 
Photo: 
On Friday (17 November), Germany signed an agreement in principle with the United States, pledging to make ten million euros available for defusing booby-traps in the ravaged city. 
Now, people are truly worried that this stable development may be over. Some believe bloody conflicts may be returning to Lebanon, or that such conflicts may erupt between Lebanon and its neighbours. 
We very much welcome the French President’s invitation to Prime Minister Hariri to travel to Paris. 
I think that’s the most important thing we must achieve in the days to come. 
I’ve just had what may have been one of my most important discussions in recent days and weeks with my colleague, the Foreign Minister of Lebanon. 
It is impossible to begin reconstructing the city until these booby-traps have been defused. 
So far, there have been no conflicts with the local population, but naturally conflicts will arise, as there is too little clean water and some people are prepared to work for less pay. 
We Germans are going to provide an additional 20 million euros. 
At the moment, people are simply afraid [to go back].” 
The offensive to liberate the city, with the support of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, lasted almost a year, and the intensive fighting in the city more than five months. 
Rapid reconstruction is crucial to allow humanitarian access and for the region’s long-term development. 
It is one of several stops he is making in capitals across Europe, to inform us about the situation in his country and in the region, and of course to also tell us about the concerns that exist in Lebanon. 
ISIS may have been defeated militarily, but it is far from being vanquished politically. 
We Germans, for our part, are prepared to help. 
My expectation is that an invitation extended by the French President will be accepted, and that no one may prevent Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and his family from accepting this invitation. 
Dramatic scenarios have been described. In addition to humanitarian aid, what political instruments do Germany and the EU have that can help stabilise the country? 
First, I think Europe must send a joint signal that we are simply no longer willing to stand by and say nothing, considering the adventurism we’ve seen there in recent months. 
This adventurism has now reached a crisis point in how Lebanon is being treated, and in how people in the region are playing with fire. 
This foreign policy adventurism must stop, and I think that we, as the entire European Union, must say so in unmistakable terms. 
Second, I think all of us are right to support the French President, who is acting as a mediator here and who has invited both the Prime Minister and his family. 
Both are suffering tremendously under the large share of refugees they have taken in and due to the situation in the region. Of course, their traditional trade ties to, and partnerships with, Syria and Iraq have been completely cut off. 
In recent years, despite the various problems it is facing, Lebanon has successfully pursued stable internal development. 
This was proof of the strength of Lebanon’s democracy and a hopeful signal that people can live together well in a country that so often in its recent history has been plagued by civil war, war and tensions. I also want to note, and I can do this as a German, that this country of a little more than four million inhabitants and that doesn’t have one of this world’s wealthiest economies has taken in one and a half million refugees. In so doing, it has assumed tremendous responsibility and is bearing an incredibly large burden because of the wars and civil wars in the region. 
For this, Lebanon deserves not only our respect, but also our help – specifically, political and economic assistance. 
Finally, I want to reconfirm that we have an interest in doing everything we can to help maintain the unity of the country, its political stability and peace. This is in the interest of Lebanon, in the interest of the entire region and in the interest of Europe. 
In view of the current situation, we are greatly concerned about stability in the region, and we call on all sides to ease the tensions. 
Despite some irritation with the current political trend in the United States, it is still true to say that 
the country is our most important partner outside Europe. 
It was with this in mind that delegations from over 70 countries met in Geneva from 13 to 17 November in order to consult at government expert level on how best to regulate such systems. 
Recently there have been signs that the country is becoming more open towards the EU. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to the Belarusian capital Minsk on Friday (17 November). 
There, he held talks with President Alexander Lukashenko and Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei. 
Gabriel and his Belarusian counterpart Makei participated in the Minsk Forum on Friday. 
All sides must now take steps to build up confidence. 
We are convinced that close relations built on trust are in both our and the region’s common interest. 
That is why we are extending our cultural and societal cooperation, particularly through the Year of Germany in the United States, which is due to take place in 2018. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the situation in the Near and Middle East 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement on the situation in the Near and Middle East: 
Our message is addressed to all actors in the region. 
From 19 November 2017 to 27 May 2018 the Kunsthalle Emden and the Drents Museum in the Dutch town of Assen are both presenting the exhibition “The American Dream”. 
The dual exhibition provides an overview of American realism from 1945 to the present, and features works by Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, Alice Neel, Richard Diebenkorn, Martha Rosler, Alex Katz and Chuck Close. 
Today (18 November), Foreign Minister Gabriel is attending the opening of the exhibition “The American Dream” in the Kunsthalle Emden. 
We expressly welcome Mr Hariri’s departure for Paris, and his imminent return to Lebanon. 
The exhibition “The American Dream” has come at the right time in view of recent developments in the United States, as it uses outstanding works of art to portray dreams and longings that still conjure up associations with the US here in Germany, too. 
It is only natural for close international partners to openly voice their concerns. 
We are united by our open societies and a common transatlantic foundation of values, which we must strive to preserve. 
In this context, the Year of Germany in the United States, due to take place from Autumn 2018, will play a crucial role. 
Surely you know that, throughout Europe, and probably around the world, people are very worried about the stability of Lebanon and of the entire region. This is because everyone, I believe, was surprised by the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri, in particular by the circumstances under which it took place – and by how Lebanon is linked to the conflicts in neighbouring countries, including to that between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
This is why I am very grateful that my colleague has come to meet with us here in Berlin today. 
I want to explicitly state that I, too, am worried, and that during the past few days we’ve tried to use our diplomatic contacts with neighbouring countries to make clear that, first and foremost, we expect that Prime Minister Hariri will be allowed to return to Beirut. 
This would be a clear sign that his freedom of movement is not being restricted. We of course also expect that he will return to Beirut, so that the country can meet the challenges it is facing within the framework of its democratic institutions and processes. 
The last thing the world needs is another de‑stabilised country – aside from the fact that the people of Lebanon have truly endured enough conflict in the past. This is why the progress they have made in recent years towards stability and peace and economic recovery must be maintained. 
A year ago, we witnessed how thanks to great efforts by important figures in Lebanon the country overcame its political standstill that has paralysed the country. 
I again want to thank my colleague, the Foreign Minister of Lebanon, for what I believe was a very thoughtful conversation. Thank you, too, for the many comments you provided with regard to our own policies. 
We are experiencing, or have experienced, the Gulf crisis, where despite mediation efforts by the US Secretary of State, no one is willing to return to a normal state of affairs. And now we have this extremely dangerous development in Lebanon. 
So I think it may be our duty, as Europeans, and particularly also as Germans, to help the economies of these two countries. These are small countries compared to us – one has four and a half million inhabitants, and the other a little more than eight million inhabitants. However, for this, the situation in both countries would need to remain stable, and political adventurism must not draw Lebanon back into a crisis. 
Stability and freedom are in the interest of not only the people in Lebanon, but also the entire region. We have far too many conflicts there already – in Yemen, and again in Iraq, where there is a dispute between northern and southern Iraq, as well as the conflict in Syria. 
For this reason it is more important than ever to promote dialogue between our societies. 
It is the first major exhibition in Europe to provide a general overview of American realism. 
The German Government attaches particular importance to dialogue with the United States.

“The international community must ensure that supplies to support the Rohingya remain adequate”, said Gabriel.

The international community therefore pledged 360 million euros to tackle the crisis at a pledging conference in Geneva at the end of October. 
Gabriel did not travel alone, but was accompanied by the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Margot Wallström and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono. 
He will attend the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Nay Pyi Taw prior to returning to Berlin on Monday evening. 
Background 
Half of these refugees are children and minors, who need special protection. 
Many refugees and migrants remain near their home region and need protection, adequate care and opportunities there. 
What is German foreign policy doing to help? 
Diplomacy has a particular role to play in this regard. 
In its national and European interests and in accordance with its international humanitarian commitments, Germany also calls for migration movements to be actively steered and shaped. 
Preventing crises: 
Alongside participation in peace missions, such projects include measures to strengthen local police structures in the Congo and promote the reconciliation process in Mali. 
Defusing crises: 
Providing humanitarian aid on the ground: 
Helping to find solutions at international level: 
Humanitarian aid 
Co-shaping a European response: 
Informing people about fleeing and migration: 
The Federal Foreign Office and its missions abroad provide information locally about the dangers of fleeing and irregular migration, as well as about the actual and legal conditions for refugees and migrants in Germany. 
Providing refugees with better protection: 
People who need protection must receive it. 
The international community supports Uganda in its endeavours. 
The vast majority of refugees worldwide remain in their home regions and find protection and a new home in their neighbouring countries. 
In this context, education is a key factor for integration and establishing a self-determined life. 
Strategy for Migration and Development – Action Plan for International Migration and Refugee Policies (in German) 
There are now more refugees in the world than at any time since the end of the Second World War. 
There are now over 65 million refugees in the world – more than at any time since the end of the Second World War. 
The main reasons why people flee or are displaced include violent conflicts, massive violations of human rights and eroding state structures in their countries of origin and transit countries. 
Economic reasons can also cause people to leave their home. 
In total, around a quarter of a billion people have left their homeland in search of protection or better prospects for themselves and their families. 
A key element of Germany’s precautionary foreign policy involves taking on a more active role as regards fostering peace and security worldwide. 
Germany is working hard to alleviate the causes of forced migration. 
The aim is to significantly mitigate the causes of forced and irregular migration. 
Aspects of Germany’s international endeavours include: 
Crisis-prevention projects help to ensure that people have no reason to flee their country in the first place. 
German foreign policy works actively to de-escalate violent conflicts, both bilaterally and at European and multilateral level. 
Stabilisation projects create opportunities for people to remain at home or return home in conflict and post-conflict situations. 
They also re-establish a safe environment and restore basic healthcare and functioning infrastructure. 
Germany provides direct aid in crisis-hit regions in the form of emergency accommodation, food, healthcare and education. 
By supporting the United Nations’ humanitarian aid organisations such as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP), Germany helps to alleviate the suffering of those most affected by conflicts and natural disasters. 
Germany is in constant contact with its European partners, with the aim of reaching a joint solution to refugee and migration issues based on solidarity and shared responsibility and improving the protection of the EU’s external borders. 
The website www.rumoursaboutgermany.info addresses and corrects false information deliberately spread by criminal gangs of human smugglers, as well as current rumours. 
Countries that take in particularly large numbers of refugees must thus be given support. 
Uganda has set new standards in its endeavours to help people who have fled the conflict in South Sudan. 
Refugees often only spend a short period of time in a refugee camp. They are often allocated a plot of land and live side by side with their Ugandan neighbours. 
At the Uganda Solidarity Summit on Refugees in Kampala in June 2017, Germany donated 50 million euros to help look after refugees. 
If migrants are not granted permission to remain legally in a third country, Germany helps them to return to their region of origin. 
For the past 25 years, Germany has helped refugees to start or continue a university degree in their host country via UNHCR’s Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee Initiative (DAFI). 
The refugee and migration situation – what German foreign policy is doing to help 
The refugee and migration situation cannot be resolved by any one country alone. Instead, the international community needs to take a joint approach. 
For example, together with Italy and the European Commission, the Federal Foreign Office co-funds a regional International Organization for Migration (IOM) project in Libya and 13 countries in the Sahel region that seeks to improve migration management and promote voluntary return to people’s countries of origin. 
Germany plays an active role in fostering a fairer division of responsibility internationally in order to solve and prevent large and protracted refugee situations and to improve migration management in the framework of the United Nations, at G20 and G7 level, and in the Global Forum on Migration and Development (https://gfmd.org/). 
Giving people opportunities: 
Promoting return and reintegration: 
From the beginning, the accusations made against him have been dubious. 
The trial did not follow basic rule-of-law principles. 
He was prevented from freely choosing his defending counsel. 
The Federal Government has repeatedly urged that Jiang Tianyong be released, and we will continue to advocate for him and other human rights defenders that are being detained in China. 
As part of this appeal, he met with, among others, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in October 2015 and Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, in November 2016. 
Jiang Tianyong was arrested on 21 November 2016. 
His trial for allegedly “inciting subversion of state power” began on 22 August 2017. 
At the trial, he repeated a dubious admission of guilt that had previously been published in media outlets. 
Commenting on the sentencing of the Chinese civil rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong to two years in prison by Changsha Intermediate People’s Court, Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (21 November): 
On 21 November, Changsha Intermediate People’s Court sentenced him to two years in prison. 
Human Rights Commissioner on sentencing of the Chinese civil rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong 
after defending individuals who had been arrested in connection with the uprising in Tibet in 2008. 
The lawyer Jiang Tianyong defended fellow citizens whose human rights were being infringed. 
The two-year prison sentence imposed today by the Changsha Intermediate People’s Court on civil rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong for “inciting subversion of state power” increases my concerns about the human rights situation in China. 
Jiang Tianyong is a prominent civil rights lawyer in China who was disbarred in 2009 
In the summer of 2015, he helped organise the defence of lawyers and human rights defenders arrested during the so-called 709 crackdown in July of 2015. This included appealing to the international community to take up the cause of those who had been arrested.

At the same time, Bangladesh is itself one of the poorest countries in the world. 
Bangladesh is also the most densely populated country. 
International support in the crisis 
The refugee camp can only be visited on foot. 
Wooden, corrugated iron and plastic shacks stand closely together, the roads are full of people, many of whom are injured, traumatised, plagued by fear. 
The heat is oppressive. 
Aid organisations are working around the clock in Kutupalong, 
providing basic medical care and distributing food to the refugees. 
But there are still enormous problems. 
When the rainy season begins, the dusty streets will be transformed into slippery torrents and the risk of infection will increase. 
So far, no tensions have arisen between the refugees and the local population. 
“Yet the conflicts will come,” Gabriel said. 
Ground water supplies are growing scarce, local people and new arrivals are competing for casual work. 
Bangladesh cannot handle this situation on its own. 
All four subsequently travelled on to the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting of the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar. 
Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Gabriel at the Minsk Forum on “Belarus in Europe” 
It is impossible to move along the road in front of Kutupalong refugee camp. 
The crowds of people walking towards the camp do not abate. 
Near the small town of Inani, one of the longest sandy beaches in the world can be found. Local people like to spend their holidays here. 
People also sit by the side of the road. They are waiting for food handouts and watching the spectacle created by the visit. 
We’re celebrating two anniversaries today: 
Moreover, already prior to the trial, Chinese media outlets published an admission of guilt. It was made under questionable circumstances and publication was tantamount to a prejudgement. 
He continued to give legal advice to family members of politically persecuted persons. 
Furthermore, he has repeatedly been detained or placed under temporary house arrest. 
Lorry upon lorry with aid supplies crawls along the narrow, sandy road. 
Kutupalong is the first stage of the Foreign Minister’s extraordinary trip. 
Since late August, hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya from neighbouring Myanmar have fled here. 
Seen from the air, the huge size of the refugee camp becomes apparent. 
Settlements comprising corrugated iron huts, barracks and temporary buildings adorn the hilly countryside in Cox’s Bazar, the refugee camp stretches out as far as the eye can see. 
The helicopter lands in the Bay of Bengal. It is not possible for it to get any closer to the refugee camp. 
On its way, the convoy passes cycle rickshaws, pedestrians, wandering cows, rickety roadside stalls, wooden buildings, paddy fields. 
Among the international community, too, the willingness to help is considerable.

Bangladesh is doing a great deal to help the Rohingya. 
Here, too, the situation of the Rohingya will be discussed: in cooperation with Myanmar, conditions must be put in place which will allow the Rohingya to return to Myanmar and live there. 
Amid the crowds, the convoy with Foreign Minister Gabriel comes to a halt.

A good 400 kilometres from Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, in the Bay of Bengal, one of the most dramatic refugee crises of our times is unfolding. 
For decades they have suffered discrimination and persecution in Myanmar. In recent months, more than 600,000 people have crossed the border into their neighbouring country in response to new police action. 
Kutupalong: more than 800,000 refugees 
Gabriel travelled from Dhaka to the Cox’s Bazar region in the south‑east of Bangladesh in a helicopter belonging to the Bangladeshi air force. 
830,000 people have found refuge in Kutupalong, more than the populations of Frankfurt am Main or Seattle. 
The helicopter takes a good five minutes to fly around the area. 
it is a clash of civilisations. 
It is not easy to say where the Bangladeshi village ends and the refugee camp begins – for the surrounding villages are also affected by severe poverty.

A quarter of the population live below the poverty line, and disasters caused by flooding regularly destroy the livelihoods of many people. 
Its capital, Dhaka, is home to around 45,000 people per square kilometre. 
In a small hut, aid workers dance and play with children – in an attempt to create a measure of normality.

Germany is therefore increasing its assistance to the country by twenty million euros. 
Gabriel was accompanied by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Margot Wallström. 
The visit to Kutupalong also posed a logistical challenge. 
On the way back, Protocol staff sent a text message reading, “Convoy no longer exists.” 
Due to the hectic activity on the roads, the vehicles were soon separated – but eventually they all arrived at the helicopter airfield. 
Nonetheless, the main outcome of the visit was a lasting impression of the suffering of the people, which will no doubt remain with Gabriel and his delegation for a long time to come. 
Let me start by thanking you for this invitation. 
I think I can say that we’re both glad to be here. 
However, I prefer another metaphor: I’d like Belarus to be an anchor. 
An anchor which links the two sides – Europe and Russia. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m certain that practically everyone here, especially the Germans, will have heard of Martin Luther. 
This year we’re celebrating the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in Germany, which began with Luther’s Theses in 1517. 
Two weeks ago, we officially celebrated this Reformation anniversary in Wittenberg, a small town in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. 
Skaryna was a printer and a famous Belarusian contemporary of Martin Luther, who published the first parts of his translation of the Bible into the Belarusian language – 500 years ago. 
Peace requires justice 
Germany has been working for many years to enhance international criminal jurisdiction, 
Sweeping prejudices against former war opponents can only be overcome and reconciliation processes can only succeed if the past is addressed by criminal jurisdiction. 
New concept – one conference, two zones – pays off 
Throughout the two weeks of negotiations in Bonn the focus was on the Paris Agreement of 2015. 
As a result of the Tribunal’s verdict, systematic rapes of women, which were deliberately used as a means of war in the Bosnian War, are now also classified as crimes against humanity under international criminal law. 
The international community made it clear that the Agreement was still valid, and that further action must be taken to protect the climate. 
Important steps for the Agreement’s implementation were agreed on, and key measures identified in the field of climate protection and adaptation. 
Further information from the ICTY on the Mladić case is available here.

Mladić can appeal against this lower-court verdict. 
Vital process of addressing the past 
The court convicted Mladić of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and sentenced him to life in prison.

as the pain of the victims and bereaved can only be alleviated if the perpetrators are named and prosecuted in person. 
Each international criminal trial thus also presents an opportunity for peace. 
The German pavilion showcased the entire spectrum of German climate initiatives. 
Pending cases will be conducted by the successor institution, the United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals. 
The verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sends an important message on international criminal law.

The verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is important as regards addressing the terrible events of the Bosnian War. 
In its verdict, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has implemented the principle that all those who commit the most serious crimes under international law must be held accountable to the international community in criminal proceedings.

The journalists also attended a media training course provided by Deutsche Welle and the UNFCCC Secretariat. 
The participating journalists will remain in touch through a network established at the Conference. Their articles and impressions can be found on their blog: 
COP23 in Bonn – a clear commitment to protect the climate 
The Bonn Zone in the Rheinaue park was the venue for a global gathering on climate and sustainability. 
A wide range of events in the national and NGO pavilions in the Bonn Zone resulted in a lively exchange between civil society and policymakers. 
Negotiations were conducted in the Bula Zone – “bula” is Fijian for “hello”. 
Panel on climate and security © Federal Foreign Office 
The Federal Foreign Office was also on site, raising awareness of its contributions to climate protection. 
A panel on climate and security, which included the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, spelt out the security policy implications of climate change: the consequences of extreme weather events and the rise in sea level have the potential to destabilise entire regions. 
In addition, the Federal Foreign Office sponsored ten journalists from the Pacific region, thereby enabling them to report first hand from the Climate Conference and give the small island states a voice.

“Further, Faster, Together” was the slogan of the Climate Change Conference in Bonn (6 to 17 November 2017) at which the international community clearly evinced its commitment to protect the climate. 
Fiji is the first country to host the Climate Change Conference which is itself directly affected by the consequences of climate change – a factor that made a crucial contribution to the event’s success. 
Over 200 million euros for climate projects 
Germany boosted confidence in the negotiations by announcing climate funding commitments totalling over 200 million euros for climate protection projects and for climate risk insurance in poorer countries. 
Over 100 side events highlighted various aspects of Germany’s climate policy and cooperation with partner countries. 
It seems to me that many people have no idea to what extent Belarus lies in the heart of Europe – not only in geographical but also in historical terms. 
One can also say that it benefited from this in good times but that, unfortunately, it has suffered tremendously whenever Europe has been in bad shape or in a difficult situation. 
When we talk today of the recent past and present of the bilateral relations between Belarus and Europe, I believe it’s nevertheless important to remember that our historical ties are truly profound. 
In my view, the Forum is a really important instrument: it offers the opportunity to engage in a critical yet very constructive dialogue aimed at creating a close partnership between Belarus and Germany. Moreover, it incorporates not just the political establishment but also civil society and business. 
That’s why it’s so important that we’re talking to each other today. 
And, indeed, this is the very first time that two Foreign Ministers have appeared at the Forum. 
For Belarus is the country which suffered most during the German occupation, the Second World War and the Nazi terror. 
The fact that statesmen and women in these countries said, “Yes, we want to try and build a peaceful Europe with the Germans now, for it’s not possible without them” cannot have been easy. I’m certain there was considerable resistance. 
Mladić verdict – crimes against humanity do not go unpunished 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague convicted Ratko Mladić today (22 November) as one of the leading figures in the Srebenica genocide and other atrocities during the Bosnian War. 
In 1995, Serbian units murdered over 8000 Muslim men and boys near Srebenica on Mladić’s orders. 
The UN Tribunal also convicted the former general of the years‑long shelling of Sarajevo, the forcible transfer of hundreds of thousands of people and systematic rapes of Muslim women and girls by his troops. 
This aim is a legacy of the Second World War and the war crimes tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo. 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is expected to announce its final verdict against Jadranko Prlić et al. on 29 November and to close at the end of the year. 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has not only played an important role in addressing war crimes and crimes against humanity in former Yugoslavia, but has also helped to further international criminal law. 
There are narratives in which countries that had been bitter enemies nevertheless became partners and friends. 
I’m very grateful that it was possible to design a joint, that’s to say a German-Belarusian exhibition to remember this extermination camp. 
An exhibition which was on show in Minsk itself, not far from the site where these crimes were committed – but also in Germany where this camp is – or so I believe – still largely unknown. 
However, we have to cultivate and reinvigorate this relationship. 
That applies to the German-Belarusian Association and the Johannes Rau International Centre for Education and Exchange. 
Our thanks also go to the Foundation for German-Polish Cooperation, the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, the Office for European Expertise and Communications, as well as the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung and the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, which are also supporting this event. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Minsk is just under an hour and a half from Berlin. In fact, it’s quicker to travel here than it is to Paris. 
Our approach to common challenges is precisely what the European Union’s Eastern Partnership is all about. 
In a week’s time, the 28 member states will be meeting their six partner countries at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels, where such key issues affecting the future of our partnership will be the focus of attention. 
Given the very different ideas of the individual partners on their relations with the EU, how can we preserve the inclusiveness of the Eastern Partnership and its regional unity? 
How can we strengthen cooperation within the region itself? 
How should we shape our relations with Russia? 
What about our relations with Central Asia? 
And we in the EU have to ask ourselves: 
how can we make the EU itself fit for cooperation with its eastern partners? 
We Germans sometimes have to explain that to our partners in the world. 
For people in Moscow, Beijing or Washington often think that they only have to talk to Germany. 
However, I believe it’s especially important for us Germans to say, “Yes, we want to be an anchor of stability; yes, we want to shoulder responsibility”. 
However, we have quite a good basis for that. 
However, exchange at civil society level is vital if truly close relations are to be forged. 
That’s why mobility is so important. 
We need all sections of our society, especially young people – trainees, students, representatives of business, the cultural scene – to gain new experiences. 
The best way to achieve that is to travel between countries and meet other people. 
That’s a tremendous signal. 
We’re negotiating a visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Belarus. 
Belarus is also seeking its own framework agreement with the EU, just like other states in the Eastern Partnership. 
I personally believe that this would be in the interest of both sides. 
Germany intends to support this. 
Despite all our optimism, we also have to be honest: 
However, there are also positive signs: 
This made possible concrete progress in the sphere of human and civil rights. 
It must now be implemented. 
But there is a large blank space on the map which doesn’t belong. In my view, we should work to rectify that. 
Trust has to grow on both sides and when it comes to this issue, considerable progress could be achieved. 
We want to accompany Belarus as it takes these steps. 
Offers have been made for close cooperation in many fields, with us, with the EU and with the OSCE. 
We’re certain that these offers haven’t fallen on deaf ears. 
Ladies and gentlemen, We need a readiness to engage in dialogue and exchange in order to map out future relations and to build bridges in Europe. 
We should seek to consolidate the dialogue between Germany and Belarus and to flesh it out with concrete ideas. 
The Minsk Forum is practically the ideal platform for this. 
Let’s make use of it – not only in the next few days but in future. 
For we can look back not only on 25 years of diplomatic relations but on at least 500 years of interesting relations. 
Thank you very much for inviting us. 
Europe, Russia and Belarus is our theme and my colleague Vladimir Makei expressed the fear that Belarus could find itself in a situation where it’s in danger of being crushed between these two sides. 
first of all we’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Minsk Forum. On the wall behind me you can see the number “15”, a reflection of the fact that the Forum hasn’t taken place every year and that there have been difficult times. 
That certainly couldn’t be taken for granted at that time – nor can it today. 
For I don’t know whether we Germans are really aware of how astonishing this is and of how great a gift it is in the light of our history. 
I cannot imagine that this gesture was ever very popular in these countries: not in France, not in the Netherlands, not in Belgium, not Luxembourg and not in Italy. 
That this has happened with Belarus is thanks to the people of that country and we’re still grateful for that. Naturally, this also means that we have an obligation to ensure that this partnership and friendship continues, that it is developed and that – wherever there are difficulties and differences – we will try and overcome them. 
I believe it was extremely important that living witnesses such as Kurt Marx were present at the opening to help give the dead an identity and to ensure that they are not forgotten. And I believe it was equally important they gave us a message for the future. 
Against this background, the good bilateral relations between our countries today are a truly great achievement. 
You’re all helping to ensure that today, 72 years after the end of the Second World War and 25 years after Belarus gained independence, our relations are marked by considerable breadth and diversity. 
In view of this proximity, it goes without saying that we should be working together to tackle challenges that transcend borders, such as the refugee situation, the fight against terrorism, as well as climate change. 
Perhaps even, how can we ensure that the European Union, which was founded to create peace and prosperity within, evolves into what it has to be, namely a player on the world stage. 
At the same time, I think it’s very important to also offer space and scope for our partners’ individual ideas, especially the needs of the smaller partner states. 
It wasn’t established under the dominance of any one country. Rather, it’s key characteristic is that we engage with one another as equal partners and that a small state like Malta is no less important and has no fewer rights than a large state. 
That engenders a certain distance to the European Union because these countries sometimes regard it as a strange entity. You cannot “phone Europe” and it is difficult to predict its decisions. 
But anyone who wants to talk to Europe cannot only speak to us; they also have to speak to the others. In other words, 
Although Franco-German initiatives are crucial, they alone are not “Europe”. Rather, Europe is an entity in which no country is dominant and in which we can only succeed in defending common interests by working together. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Naturally, after many years of limited contact between the EU and Belarus we have to rebuild understanding and mutual trust. 
We’ve already made good headway and I hope we can resolve the outstanding issues as quickly as possible and show flexibility, so that we don’t need too much time on the last leg. 
However, it will also depend on how Belarus develops and whether a willingness to compromise as well as confidence are signalled. 
The Minsk Forum itself was suspended for many years and the fact that resistance and scepticism emerge time and again is due to causes which still exist in some cases. 
The rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, electoral reform, freedom of assembly, the difficult matter of the death penalty – these issues remain key to improving our relations. 
the drafting of a national action plan for human rights in Belarus. 
My colleague Vladimir Makei knows that I’d like measures to be taken to enable Belarus to accede to the Council of Europe, 
Russia, Ukraine and all member states of the European Union are members. 
In 2017, we’re celebrating the Reformation, which contains the word “reform”. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel to travel to London 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will travel to London on Friday, 24 November 2017 for political talks with his British counterpart Boris Johnson. 
The talks will focus on the situation in the Middle East. 
Another cold winter is coming. 
Germany is doing what it can, as the largest bilateral donor for the people in Ukraine. 
When asked what she wishes for most, this elderly lady in eastern Ukraine did not hesitate one second. “Peace,” she said. 
“I want peace again after all this time.” 
Her husband nods. 
She thinks for a moment and then says, 
“If I had another wish, I would wish to see my grandchildren again.” They live in the next village – on the other side of the contact line. 
In the evening the same thing in reverse to get back home. 
He used to work in the coal mines on the other side. Since the fighting broke out, he’s been unemployed – like all his fellow workers. 
It would be too dangerous to cross the contact line every day. 
Now they are living off the produce of their small garden. 
The husband proudly shows us the chickens pecking the ground in a small enclosure behind the house. 
“We got five chickens from the Red Cross last year, and now we already have ten!” And with those words the 60-year-old, whose weather-beaten face and calloused hands make him look more like 80, turns back to chopping firewood. A cold, cold winter is approaching. 
The temperature is likely to stay below zero degrees Celsius for months, which will make life in the hastily repaired houses extremely unpleasant. 
And there’s a danger that the water supply could collapse, leaving thousands of people even more desperate in their flats when it’s -20°C outside. 
Winter worries 
There’s a shortage of coal for heating. 
The conflict in eastern Ukraine has affected people’s daily lives in many dramatic ways. 
Food, water, basic everyday supplies. 
But many aid organisations can no longer get through to the people in the separatist-controlled areas. There are often problems about registering with the de facto authorities. The separatists simply deny international NGOs access to those in need. 
How Germany is helping 
Before hostilities started, it was just a ten-minute bus ride away. Nowadays you risk your life going there. 
Her husband has not held a job for a long time now. 
Humanitarian concerns as winter approaches in eastern Ukraine 
Together with German and international partners, the Federal Foreign Office is funding food deliveries and medical care for the people affected by the conflict. 
Psychosocial programmes are being run to help people cope with their experiences in the war. 
Germany also continues to advocate the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. 
Drawing attention to forgotten humanitarian crises 
People here are starting to forget the humanitarian crisis in eastern Ukraine. 
The Federal Foreign Office and a group of German aid organisations have launched the #nichtvergesser initiative to draw attention to neglected humanitarian crises. 
The one in Ukraine is among them – a humanitarian crisis right here in Europe.

An armed conflict is being fought right here in Europe. 
Millions of people are still living in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, reliant on humanitarian assistance.

All the same, the elderly couple set off once a month. After waiting at the check point for hours in the bitter cold, they proceed on foot through no-man’s-land and its mines to the next check point, where they again wait to enter occupied territory. 
But being back home does not mean they are safe. Their village is right on the contact line and is still shelled almost every night. 
Millions of people in eastern Ukraine are worried about what it will be like when winter arrives. 
There is in fact enough coal in the region – it’s just on the other side of the conflict line. 
This is only one of the many difficulties caused by the simmering conflict, the brunt of which is borne by the civilian population. 
Germany has been helping the people in Ukraine since the conflict started and has become the largest donor tackling the humanitarian crisis. 
So far this year, it has contributed more than 23 million euros for relief projects.

In these agreements, the parties to the conflict have, for example, pledged to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to all people in need in eastern Ukraine. 
But it is precisely those humanitarian emergencies that are not in the media spotlight which need support. 
Many of those who remain are elderly, ill, or have disabilities.

Foreign Minister Gabriel issued the following statement today (24 November) in the wake of the attack on a mosque in North Sinai, which claimed the lives of more than 235 people and injured many others: 
We condemn in the strongest possible terms this perfidious terrorism, which once again has not even spared places of worship and peaceful people of faith from its brutal atrocities. 
“We are shocked by the news that has reached us from Egypt 
and stand firmly by Egypt's side. 
We offer our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to all those who have been injured in this cowardly attack.” 
I suspect, however, that Germans and Protestants outside Germany won’t know anything about Francysk Skaryna from Polatsk. 
Why am I telling you this at the outset of my speech today? 
It’s not because of the Reformation anniversary year but, rather, because it shows that we’ve had ties for much longer than we’re perhaps sometimes aware. 
Belarus is a genuinely European country with a rich history and culture which is closely interwoven with pan‑European history. 
Secondly, it’s now 25 years since Belarus and Germany re‑established diplomatic relations. 
The inauguration of the Trascianiec memorial – we have to call this an extermination camp, a genocide camp – reminds us of that. 
That such a country has welcomed us Germans with such friendliness and openness, with an outstretched hand, certainly wasn’t self‑evident. 
Nor was it self‑evident that a few years after the Second World War, the countries through which shortly beforehand Germany had pillaged, burned and murdered invited us back into the fold of civilised peoples to found Europe together. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m saying this because I believe that today it’s a good idea to remind ourselves that this is clearly possible. Despite the most brutal memories and experiences, people – even those belonging to the generation which experienced all of this at first‑hand – are able to reach out to each other and to turn their enemies into partners and, with time, even into friends. 
In a world which seems to be increasingly plagued by conflict every day, in which war, civil conflict, terror and confrontation are the order of the day, in which we’re no longer certain whether the international order we know will still be there for our children, it’s good to remember that there have also been positive experiences. 
All those who use the Minsk Forum to build bridges, to cast anchor and to shape our relations with far‑sightedness are doing great work. 
For when it comes to the international arena, conflicts and changes in the world are forcing Europe to become visible both internally and vis‑à‑vis the outside world. 
we are all Europe, and no‑one here is less important than anyone else. 
Since 2016, the EU‑Belarus Coordination Group has provided a framework for regular dialogue. 
The contacts among government representatives, which often take place together with representatives of civil society, can now be continued at political level. 
Belarus has waived visa requirements for citizens from 80 countries, including all EU states, for short‑term stays. 
Incidentally, it also signals self‑confidence. 
our relations were not at all trouble‑free for a long time. 
which would then comprise 47 states. 
I believe that this is a good mission for us all. 
Ladies and gentlemen, The European Union’s strength is that it doesn’t really matter whether a country is large or small. 
I was very moved by the opening of the exhibition in Trascianiec in March, 75 years after the deportation of Hamburg’s Jews to Minsk. 
The Spirit of Wiesbaden: Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
But then the company notices that the telephone numbers on the form come from different countries. 
And they want to pay in cash? 
Greater security through export controls 
A thorough check is carried out to ensure that the machine really is – as claimed – only being supplied to a tinning factory. 
The Federal Foreign Office is closely involved alongside the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control and the Federal Intelligence Service. 
However, it is not enough if only Germany pays such close attention. 
Close cooperation with companies 
The Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control help other states to implement the resolution through efficient export controls. 
Furthermore, companies can most easily be introduced to the often complex processes through dialogue. 
The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) and the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control are partners in the organisation of these conferences. 
What is special about them is the much-invoked Spirit of Wiesbaden: 
The results are subsequently made available to all UN member states. 
Attempts are made time and again to acquire normal industrial goods with the aim of producing weapons of mass destruction. 
Germany hosts a global dialogue in Wiesbaden to discuss what measures can be taken to better prevent this. 
Participants in the Wiesbaden Conference © Matthias Hilbrich 
In order to prevent this, such exports are subject to control in Germany. 
The Spirit of Wiesbaden 
rather than a rigid format, the conferences provide a stage for an open dialogue between business and governments without any obligations. 
Controllers and those subject to controls can thus pull in the same direction and share their experiences with each other and with less experienced states. 
Wiesbaden Conference: Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction © Matthias Hilbrich 
What does a German mechanical engineering firm have to do with nuclear weapons? 
The order looks like any other. 
German companies are sometimes targeted by procurement networks for parts to manufacture weapons of mass destruction or missiles. 
The items in question are dual‑use goods: 
for example, the machine which can not only be used to produce parts of tin cans but also nuclear weapons. 
All states must control sensitive exports. Otherwise proliferation-sensitive goods will simply be ordered from the weakest link. 
To ensure that no-one is left behind and that terrorists and other non-state players do not gain access to weapons of mass destruction, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 in 2004, thus placing all UN member states under an obligation to control exports, to punish contraventions and to secure stocks of sensitive goods. 
Germany believes that a close exchange between state agencies and the affected companies is very important. 
No‑one knows the buyers better or knows better which goods are on the shopping lists of the procurement networks than the manufacturers themselves. 
On 23 and 24 November, the Federal Foreign Office therefore invited representatives from industry, governments and civil society in 17 countries to Wiesbaden for the fifth time. 
Within the framework of the Wiesbaden Process, there were discussions on how global export controls can be strengthened through cooperation. There was also an opportunity for an exchange of experiences in this sphere. 
South Korea and Mexico have already adapted the format and organised regional Wiesbaden Conferences in 2016 and 2017. 
India has announced that it will be hosting a regional conference for South Asia in 2018. 
All of the websites of Germany’s missions abroad will gradually be converted to the new format. 
With over 20,000 subpages and more than 50,000 visitors per day, diplo.de is the Federal Foreign Office’s main service and information portal. 
Statement issued by Foreign Minister Gabriel prior to his departure for Abidjan 
The streamlined site places mobile use at the heart of user experience, 
Further information is available at 
Foreign Minister Gabriel is travelling to Abidjan for the African Union-European Union Summit in the early hours of Tuesday morning (28 November). 
Revamped Federal Foreign Office website and travel app focuses on users 
with a responsive design adapting the site to the device being used. 
The new design focuses on user services. 
Weakened by terrorism and tribal conflicts, countries such as Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and the Niger are at risk of becoming havens for human traffickers and armed militias. 
The app provides tips, a check list for organising trips abroad and the contact details of embassies and consulates in Germany. 
Should users encounter any problems abroad, the app provides information for emergencies and the contact details of the German missions in the country. 
Users also have the option of putting their destinations on a pin board, which means they receive a push notification if there are any changes to the travel and security advice for these countries. 
Together with our international partners, we want to support the African Peace and Security Architecture as well as strengthen African ownership in the areas of crisis prevention, conflict resolution and stabilisation. 
Promoting responsible investment 
Rapid population growth: 
Economic prospects are also key to stable development. 
Populations on the African continent are growing rapidly. 
Harnessing the economic opportunities of this development and avoiding its risks is one of the most urgent challenges for the future. 
Africa will only live up to its full economic potential if fair terms can be ensured for its integration into the global economy. 
when people on our neighbouring continent are so frightened by conflicts that they flee their homes, this directly affects us here in Europe. 
If we want to prevent crises, manage conflicts and promote peace, we must have a three-pronged political strategy that promotes security, good governance and development. 
Another topic will be how we can promote sustainable and inclusive economic development in Africa. 
Germany has long been committed to bringing greater stability to the region. 
For example, the Federal Foreign Office is providing financial support for police training measures and for projects to promote reconciliation among rival ethnic groups. 
Focus on helping people to help themselves 
At the summit in Abidjan, Foreign Minister Gabriel intends to advocate gearing the EU’s support in the Sahel region even more closely to helping people to help themselves. 
Germany intends to promote initiatives that help the countries in the region to achieve greater security themselves, such as a joint force for the Sahel countries Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and the Niger. 
Targeted support to small and medium-sized enterprises is a particularly good way to create jobs and better prospects for people on the continent. 
The Federal Foreign Office launched a new and improved version of its website www.diplo.de in mid‑November. 
On the German version of the site, the large number of visitors interested in travel and security can find out more about their destination from the drop‑down menu on the homepage. 
The redesigned newsroom provides the latest reports and press releases by the Federal Foreign Office, while an easy‑to‑use search function allows users to look for articles. 
Alongside travel and security advice, the site provides information on foreign and European policy, the Foreign Minister’s schedule, career opportunities in the Federal Foreign Office and international organisations as well as detailed background information on specific topics and country profiles. 
The redesigned Sicher Reisen (Travel Safely) app includes new features and is now available in app stores. 
On its relaunched website, the Federal Foreign Office also has an open data interface, where data such as travel and security advice and the addresses of embassies and consulates will be available for further use in a JSON format. 
“We must ensure that these countries are able to prevent conflicts before they emerge in the first place”, said Gabriel. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel gave the following statement in Berlin today (27 November), prior to departing for the 5th African Union‑European Union Summit in Abidjan: 
Whether it be in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel or the Great Lakes Region – 
At our meeting in Abidjan, we will look back on one decade of German‑African cooperation in the spheres of peace and security and conduct a stock‑taking based on our border management and police cooperation projects. We will also discuss how our cooperation can be continued, also by involving the European Union. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel to travel to Saint Petersburg

On Wednesday, 29 November, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel will travel to Saint Petersburg, where he will participate in the 10th German-Russian Raw Materials Conference. 
Whether in the area of migration, climate change or security, Africa and Europe are more reliant upon one another than ever before. 
Gabriel travels to Abidjan for AU‑EU Summit 
The heads of state and government of the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU) are therefore meeting in Côte d’Ivoire. 
In Côte d’Ivoire’s capital, the Foreign Ministers will discuss issues that are crucial to developments in Africa and the EU. 
Items on their agenda include the fragile security situation in the Sahel region, as well as rapid population growth and humanitarian crises. 
This is already the fifth summit to be held between the EU and the AU.

Federal Foreign Office on the conference of the Syrian opposition in Riyadh and negotiations in Geneva 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (28 November) on the latest round of the Syria negotiations in Geneva and the meeting in Riyadh from 22 to 24 November at which representatives of the Syrian opposition agreed to form a joint negotiating delegation: 
We welcome the agreement reached in Riyadh. 
This is the only way for a political settlement within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 to come closer to reality. 
We would also like to thank the Saudi Arabian hosts of the Riyadh conference, whose patient mediation was instrumental in achieving this agreement. 
This is all the more urgent as the humanitarian emergency and heavy fighting are continuing in many parts of the country. 
Current articles on the situation in Syria 
The regime must no longer, and for no apparent reason, delay the commencement of direct negotiations with the opposition on the political future of Syria. 
The opposition’s united platform agreed to at the conference and its willingness to engage in unconditional negotiations are important steps towards entering into direct talks between the regime and the opposition under the auspices of the United Nations. 
It reads: 
“I was deeply saddened by the news about the terrible attack on a mosque in the north of the Sinai peninsula. 
We would like to congratulate Nasr al‑Hariri, who as chief negotiator in Geneva distinguished himself with his astute and balanced leadership, on his election as the new coordinator of the High Negotiations Committee of the Syrian opposition. 
In the coming days, the next move will have to be made by Assad and those who support him, first and foremost Russia and Iran. 
Time and again there are many civilian victims, such as in Ghouta at the weekend; many people, especially children, are stilly dying of diseases that are actually curable, as well as of malnutrition and the impact of the war, as humanitarian access continues to be blocked in many areas. 
The population urgently needs a humanitarian respite. 
We offer our heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families. 
I hope that you and the people of Egypt will have the strength that is needed to remain united in the fight against terrorism.” 
On the attack in Egypt 
Devout Muslims who had gathered for traditional Friday prayers in their place of worship were murdered by the cowardly attackers. 
Federal Foreign Office comments on the 5+2 Transnistrian settlement negotiations 
We welcome the fact that the official 5+2 talks on the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict took place in Vienna yesterday and today, after a hiatus of over one year. 
The parties to the negotiations have thereby reaffirmed their commitment to the 5+2 format as the agreed route towards a lasting and fair solution to the conflict. 
Practical progress can only be made if the parties meet in person for regular talks in various formats. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (29 November) on North Korea’s latest missile test: 
On behalf of the German Government, I condemn North Korea’s ballistic missile test in the strongest possible terms. 
We would like to explicitly congratulate Austria on this success. 
The United Nations Security Council has clearly and unanimously condemned North Korea’s recent nuclear and missile tests. 
We must continue to increase the pressure on North Korea. 
This is the only way to reach a peaceful solution and to convince North Korea of the necessity to engage in talks. 
Initial findings suggest that this was an intercontinental missile. 
This represents another breach of international law on the part of North Korea, whose 
irresponsible actions represent an enormous threat to international security. 
The regime in Pyongyang has stoked tensions in the region once again with this latest test. 
This serves as another reminder of how serious a threat North Korea poses to world peace. 
I therefore call on North Korea with the utmost urgency to comply with all applicable UN Security Council resolutions and to immediately cease all activities relating to its illegal missile and nuclear programme without exception. 
It was launched from Pyongsong, in the direct vicinity of the capital Pyongyang, and flew over North Korean territory for approximately 1000 km before crashing into the sea in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. 
There have been negotiations aimed at resolving the Transnistrian conflict since 1993. 
The process brings together representatives from Moldova and Transnistria with the OSCE, Russia and Ukraine, who serve as mediators, and the EU and the US, who have observer status (the “5+2 format”). 
The chief negotiators also meet in a 1+1 format, as do specialists from the two sides to develop technical solutions to practical problems. 
This success vindicates the “small steps” strategy adopted by the German OSCE Chairmanship in 2016 and successfully continued by the Austrian Chairmanship in 2017. 
After the 5+2 meeting in Vienna organised by the OSCE, a Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson commented as follows today (28 November) regarding the progress made: 
We will continue to support the OSCE’s endeavours to find solutions to all unresolved issues while respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova and ensuring a special status for Transnistria. 
The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the de facto separation of Transnistria (an area east of the Nistru/Dniester river, whose population is comprised of roughly equal numbers of Moldovans, Russians and Ukrainians) from the Republic of Moldova. 
Its unilateral declaration of independence has not been recognised by any country in the world. 
The Berlin Protocol, which envisaged negotiations on telecommunications, the functioning of Latin Script Schools, access to agricultural land and mutual recognition of car registration plates and university diplomas, was signed during Germany’s Chairmanship of the OSCE. 
We must oppose this threat resolutely and unambiguously as an international community. 
The offers are on the table, as we all know. 
North Korea has disregarded them once again with its missile test in contravention of international law. 
The North Korean Ambassador will be summoned to the Federal Foreign Office on Wednesday to this end. 
In the early hours of the morning (2.47 a.m. local time) on 29 November 2017, North Korea carried out a further missile test in violation of international law. 
Federal Foreign Office increases aid for Mosul

While the terrorist militia IS has been driven out, the city still lies in ruins. 
Germany has pledged a further 150 million euros for humanitarian assistance and stabilisation measures. 
Germany is to support reconstruction in regions of Iraq destroyed by IS with an additional 150 million euros. 
This aid is primarily intended to help the citizens of Mosul. 
Large parts of the city in northern Iraq lie in ruins following its liberation from IS’ reign of terror.

When retreating from the city, the terrorist militia left behind a deadly legacy. 
Numerous mines and primed explosive charges lurk in the ruins of the city. 
All the while booby-traps and munition are not defused, returning to the city will be hazardous for civilians. 
Giving people hope for a peaceful life 
The Federal Foreign Office has now pledged a further 150 million euros of aid in order to give the people of Mosul hope for a peaceful life once again. 
“Citizens must have prospects of a bright future for themselves and their families," said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. 
People in the region are particularly dependent on help before the winter sets in. 
Some 100 million euros of this sum will therefore be set aside for humanitarian aid work on the ground. 
These funds will be used by Germany to support the work of UN relief organisations such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the region. 
Aid fosters stability and trust

A further 50 million euros will go towards stabilising the region. 
“Only once infrastructure and the administrative apparatus are restored can terrorism be defeated in the long term," said Gabriel. 
Well-functioning authorities and reliable structures are essential for ensuring that reconstruction progresses and that the liberated regions develop in a stable manner. 
Germany is therefore using this aid to finance projects such as police training and further training in administration and governance. 
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is an important partner in these efforts. 
Germany is the second-largest humanitarian donor to Iraq. 
In the past three years, the Federal Foreign Office has supported the people of Iraq to the tune of over 500 million euros. 
But what does stabilisation mean in practice? 
He was only able to identify a car’s colour and make. 
Faizullah recalls a time when he was supposed to arrest the driver of a yellow car for using a false registration plate. 
But all that is now in the past since 
In this stabilisation work, the focus is on providing short and medium-term support. 
Zahneisen underlines that the Afghans are proud of their police officers. 
“In my own case, I didn’t learn to read or write as a child because of the war,” Faizullah says. 
Faizullah now has a diploma equivalent to three years of primary school education and can do all the things he could not even imagine in the past, 
Unlike many of his colleagues, he no longer has to ask a child to read out the name on an arrest warrant for him. 
“Afghans have deep roots in their region,” Fritzenwenger says. 
“They rarely leave their home for economic reasons to go to Kabul, let alone another country. 
Although the army is primarily responsible in Afghanistan for the fight against extremists such as the Taliban, 
the police stand for the presence of the state outside the urban centres. 
“In regions where the security situation is tense, police officers rapidly become involved in other security tasks,” Fritzenwenger says. 
This makes it all the more important for the security situation that lower-ranking police officers in particular stay on and do not move to other less dangerous or better paid jobs at the earliest opportunity. 
“The police literacy courses make the job more attractive, as they help people and improve their promotion prospects,” Fritzenwenger says. 
Every day, the course participants spend two hours of their shift learning to read and write. 
During the rest of their shift, they do their normal jobs. 
sending teaching material, tables, benches and a blackboard and training a suitable teacher. 
In addition to standard adult literacy material, the project has developed special elements for police officers. 
“This material addresses topics that are not covered in depth during regular police training,” Fritzenwenger says. 
and a further 32,000 officers are currently taking lessons. 
The benefits can be felt immediately. 
“Because I can read now, I noticed a false registration plate during a recent vehicle inspection,” says Abdul Latif, a 28-year-old police officer from the small town of Baghlan in northern Afghanistan. 
“And only in this way can we pave the path to peace in Afghanistan.” 
Germany held the Presidency of the G20 up until 30 November 2017.

Focus on international crises: Foreign Minister Gabriel travels to Washington for talks 
Sigmar Gabriel and Rex Tillerson in August 2017 
During his trip to the United States on 30 November 2017, Foreign Minister Gabriel will once again meet his American counterpart Rex Tillerson. 
Not even during turbulent times at home does the world stand still: 
This is already his fourth visit to the American capital since he took up office in January. 
Remaining engaged in debate at all levels 
During this trip, Gabriel will once again meet his opposite number Rex Tillerson. 
Close cooperation with the United States is essential if these conflicts are to be resolved – but not only at administrative level: 
talks with members of Congress are also on the agenda. 
The future of the nuclear agreement with Iran is currently a matter of particular concern. 
Using diverse relations 
“It is important that all sides strictly implement the agreement: 
For him, there are many different ways of nurturing German-Russian relations: 
Political solution needed to overcome distrust 
Gabriel made clear: 
“Together we have the responsibility not to return to the spiral of distrust and rearmament.” 
From Krasnodar to Moscow: Gabriel’s third visit to Russia 
“The latest North Korean missile test highlights once more the potential for escalation when there is no framework for settling a conflict.” 
the neverending conflict in eastern Ukraine, the smouldering crisis in the Persian Gulf and the threat posed by North Korea’s missile programme are all pressing foreign policy issues which Foreign Minister Gabriel intends to address in Washington on Thursday (30 November). 
Gabriel stated prior to his departure, 
it prevents Iran from producing nuclear weapons, thus making the region safer.” He went on to say that it also had wider implications. 
“If the agreement fails, it would send a disastrous message with regard to rearmament, both in the region and around the world.” He added that ultimately the aim was to contain conflicts via regulating mechanisms. 
On 24 November, following the Sinai attack, Federal President Frank‑Walter Steinmeier sent a message of condolence to Abdul Fattah al‑Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.

“Shared interest in overcoming political crises” – Gabriel at Raw Materials Conference in Saint Petersburg 
We are also promoting youth exchanges and fostering cultural exchange.” As Gabriel pointed out, it is also in the interest of both sides to step up economic relations. 
He attended the 10th German-Russian Raw Materials Conference to have an opportunity to talk to the participants about the current situation regarding economic relations.

At the 10th German-Russian Raw Materials Conference on Wednesday (29 November) in Saint Petersburg, Foreign Minister Gabriel advocated building new trust. 
“We all have a shared interest in overcoming the political crises,” Foreign Minister Gabriel emphasised. 
“This summer, I opened the German-Russian Year of Municipal and Regional Partnerships with my colleague Sergey Lavrov in Krasnodar. 
Economic relations are strained particularly due to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the resulting EU sanctions. 
“We need an effective ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and compliance with the Minsk Agreement in order to reduce sanctions.” A political solution in Ukraine is essential for relations to return to normal. 
On 28 June, Foreign Minister Gabriel travelled to the Russian city of Krasnodar for the town‑twinning conference and then from there to Moscow.

Press release 30 November 2017 
Ms Quynh is one of the best-known bloggers in Viet Nam and writes under the pen name Mother Mushroom. 
Following her arrest in October 2016, she was presented in absentia with the International Women of Courage Award by US First Lady Melania Trump in March 2017. 
the aim of truly modernising the country cannot be achieved without civic engagement and greater transparency. 
I call on the Vietnamese government to release Ms Quynh and numerous other political prisoners, to respect basic rights guaranteed by the constitution and to uphold rule‑of‑law procedures. 
Most recently, Quynh was actively engaged in the fight to defend the rights of fishermen in central Viet Nam who were affected by an environmental disaster caused by industrial waste. 
Ms Quynh criticised, among other things, the inaction of government authorities when faced with financially powerful environmental polluters. 
On 10 October 2016, Ms Quynh’s house was searched by dozens of police officers and she herself was arrested. 
At the end of June 2017, she was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

During the Presidency, the G20 thus worked to further multilateral cooperation. 
The strong commitment to multilateralism is reflected in all fields and is the recurring theme all the way through the Communiqué of the G20 Heads of State and Government. 
During the Presidency, the Federal Government worked together with the OECD.

She also campaigned for imprisoned activists and their families. 
Bärbel Kofler, Human Rights Commissioner of the Federal Government, issued the following statement today (30 November) on the appeal court ruling against popular Vietnamese blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (Mother Mushroom): 
I am saddened and outraged that the prison sentence against blogger and activist Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh has been upheld. 
This ruling contravenes international treaties on civil and political rights, which Viet Nam itself has ratified. 
As a journalist, she raised awareness about the large number of unexplained deaths in prison or police custody. 
She also worked tirelessly in support of the fishermen and their families affected by an environmental disaster in central Viet Nam. 
Her arrest and trial, and the ruling against her, are all the more incomprehensible as the focus of her work was precisely on those areas where the Vietnamese government itself sees the most urgent need for reform, namely 
The German Presidency focused on three fields which were summarised under the headings: 
administrative law and procedures, the environment and consumer protection. 
Freedom of opinion and of the press in Viet Nam - and those who fight for it - have been subjected to an unprecedented level of state‑run attacks in 2017. 
With its multifaceted input into the central fields, the OECD made an essential contribution to the success of the German G20 Presidency. 
Tangible results were achieved not just on international cooperation on the global economy, such as for example the decision to tackle together excess capacities in the steel industry, but also on questions regarding health, the Africa Partnership and on steps to improve opportunities for women, tangible results were achieved. 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the decision to uphold the 10‑year prison sentence for Vietnamese blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh 
She is to go to prison for ten years because she exercised her right of freedom of opinion - a right guaranteed by the Vietnamese constitution. 
Unfortunately, however, the decision of the appeal court fits all too well with the many arrests and convictions, police harassment and attacks - including physical violence - against journalists, bloggers, activists and lawyers in the past months. 
Text for the video on Foreign Minister Gabriel’s visit to Washington to discuss Iran 
So it is not the case that Europe has no sanctions whatsoever against Iran. 
We need to talk with the Americans about what we can offer Iran, but also what measures we can take against it. 
We have to offer something so it is worthwhile for Iran to negotiate with us. But we also need the option of having joint sanctions mechanisms. 
What we no longer have are sanctions because of the threat of nuclear armament – and we don’t want to go back to those days. 
We have 280 entities and people from Iran in the sanctions regime, including under European law, because of human rights violations and other issues. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy, issued the following statement today (1 December) on the execution of five people in Afghanistan on 29 November: 
These are the first executions to be carried out in the country this year.

Gabriel in Washington 
Human Rights Commissioner Bärbel Kofler on the execution of five people in Afghanistan 
I was concerned to hear the news that five people were executed in Afghanistan on 29 November. 
Afghanistan is an important partner for us and one that we are cooperating with in many areas in a spirit of trust. 
I wish therefore to call upon the Afghan Government to suspend further use of the death penalty. 
A moratorium on the death penalty would be an important step towards improving the human rights situation and would help to overcome past conflicts, thereby bringing greater stability to the country. 
The Federal Foreign Office on the situation in Yemen 
the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the threat posed by North Korea’s missile programme and the future of the nuclear agreement with Iran are all pressing foreign policy issues which Foreign Minister Gabriel addressed during his one-day visit to Washington on Thursday (30 November). 
Close partnership 
This was already his fourth visit to the American capital since he took up office in January. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (1 December) on yesterday’s firing of a missile at south-western Saudi Arabia, for which Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility: 
The United States is one of Germany’s most important partners outside Europe. 
During this trip, Gabriel met his opposite number Rex Tillerson once again to exchange views on difficult issues. 
The future of the nuclear agreement with Iran was also raised during the talks: 
“We Europeans, together with the United States, want to work to limit the destabilisation of Iran in the region – without damaging the nuclear agreement.” 
Previous visits by Gabriel to Washington: 
February 2017 – Gabriel in the US: 
“We are closely united by shared values” 
Foreign Minister Gabriel in the United States 
August 2017 –Working closely with Washington: 
The only way out of the crisis is by means of a ceasefire and political dialogue. 
This is an important and positive step. 
Millions are starving, and the country’s people are suffering under a cholera epidemic of frightening proportions. 
An agreement with a strong message 
All parties to the conflict have been called upon to eliminate the remaining obstacles to humanitarian and commercial access. 
Germany is immediately making available a further 40 million euros in humanitarian aid. This includes emergency food aid 
According to Gabriel, the nuclear agreement with Iran is of crucial importance: 
Gabriel stated he was convinced that 
“We need to develop common positions. 
The Federal Government condemns the most recent firing of a missile from Yemen at Saudi Arabian territory. 
The incident has further escalated the situation and once again shows that we urgently need a political resolution to the conflict in Yemen. 
This must be done through diplomatic channels, because any military action would only cause the situation to deteriorate even further. 
For several days, the maritime ports on the Red Sea and Sana’a Airport have been open again. Aid supplies can now again be transported to the populous regions in northern and eastern Yemen. 
and supplies needed to meet other humanitarian needs, including medical care. 
Currently, an additional 40 million euros are being made available to United Nations humanitarian aid programmes and to the World Food Programme. 
This aid will go to providing food rations to those in need, to local health care providers, such as cholera treatment centres, and to providing clean drinking water. 
Following their meeting, the Minister stated that there was a common position with the Americans in many areas. 
May 2017 – Gabriel back in Washington: 
The Federal Government continues to fully support the endeavours by Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen. The Federal Government welcomes the fact that the Saudi‑led military coalition has now loosened its blockade of Yemeni harbours and airports that had been imposed in reaction to Houthi rebels’ firing of a missile at Riyadh airport in early November. 
As long as more than 20 million people in the country – 11 million of these being children – require humanitarian assistance, we must not let up in our efforts. 
Yemen is currently facing one of the largest present‑day humanitarian crises.

Gabriel also called for the upholding of the agreement in talks with Democrat and Republican Members of Congress. 
“There is relatively widespread understanding that the nuclear agreement should certainly be preserved but at the same time Iran should be put under pressure to cut back its support for terrorism, war and various trouble spots,” the Foreign Minister optimistically summarised.

He added that close coordination with the US partners was required: 
We will continue our talks on the fringes of the NATO summit in Europe in the coming week.” 
Refugees and migrants in the country are still in desperate straits. 
- and to make the best possible use of, as well as expand, the opportunities afforded by digital technology. 
The Federal Foreign Office sees international cyber policy as a cross‑cutting task impacting virtually all areas of foreign policy. 
- to guarantee the security of cyberspace and contain threats resulting from the spread of digital technologies, 
- to safeguard universal human rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of opinion and the press, also on the internet, as well as to ensure responsible use of the internet’s freedom-generating potential, 
With a view to tackling these tasks in cooperation with our international partners, we are taking action on various levels: 
The goal is to ensure that German interests and ideas concerning cyber security are coordinated and pursued in international organisations, such as the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the OECD and NATO. 
Within the United Nations, we were able to reach a consensus that human rights have to be protected “online” just as they are “offline”. 
In this context, we remain committed to the protection of privacy in the digital age, and we are an active member of the Freedom Online Coalition, for which we will assume the chairmanship in 2018. 
We thus want to help ensure that the internet evolves in a way that produces global win‑win situations from which also newly industrialised and developing countries stand to gain. 
The Federal Foreign Office’s International Cyber Policy Coordination Staff, established in 2011, works with other ministries and actors to ensure a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace. 
Since the summer of 2015, Dr Thomas Fitschen has been the Director for the United Nations, International Cyber Policy and Counterterrorism. 
How Libya develops and what happens in the country also affects us in Europe and Germany. 
Several key issues are involved in our support. 
Our additional funding will facilitate this expansion. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian announced the recipients of the Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law on Monday (4 December). 
“By presenting these awards we are making plain that our two countries do not want to allow human rights and the rule of law to be exposed to constantly growing pressure,” as Gabriel outlined together with his colleague Minister Le Drian. 
The activists’ stories make impressive reading. These are the recipients in 2017: 
The winners in 2017 are: 
We are honouring and supporting human rights defenders all over the world who work tirelessly to protect and promote human rights. 
The Prize is intended to honour and support people who have distinguished themselves by protecting and promoting human rights in their homeland, in other countries or at international level, or who have launched initiatives to promote the rule of law. 
We will continue to support Libya on its path to stabilisation.” 
Federal Foreign Office to provide additional funding for Libya 
The Government must gain control quickly over the entire country and do its work for the benefit of its own population. 
Secondly, we want more effective aid for the large number of migrants who urgently wish to return to their country of origin. 
This also involves enabling them to resettle in Europe and other regions. 
In providing support to Libya, our aim is to alleviate human suffering, stabilise the country and strengthen the Government. 
Firstly, we want better protection for refugees and migrants in Libya, who are still forced to live in detention centres, at times in terrible conditions. 
Thirdly, permanent and safe solutions must be found for the people in Libya identified as refugees by UNHCR. 
This is part of an EU resettlement programme, which needs to be expanded rapidly in the coming months. 
“The Federal Foreign Office is providing an additional 28 million euros to fund aid measures by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Food Programme (WFP), in particular in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. 
Our humanitarian partner organisations have used the funding provided by us to save lives. 
The German Government has already done a great deal in 2017 to help alleviate the food crises in north east Nigeria, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa.

“Changing the people’s mindset” – talks with African tutors at the Federal Foreign Office 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the provision of further funding for aid measures 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (4 December) on the provision of further funding for ICRC and WFP aid measures in Africa: 
The Federal Foreign Office has provided over 400 million euros in humanitarian aid to Africa in 2017.” 
The Heads of State and Government discussed opportunities for the future for people in Africa at the AU-EU Summit in Abidjan. 
Nevertheless, there is still great poverty, as well as humanitarian needs that we must address. 
Germany reiterates its commitment to Africa and its people. 
However, we must not lose sight of the dramatic situation facing millions of people in Africa who are affected by crises and conflicts in the here and now. 
Due to his commitment, the human rights activist has been subjected to various threats and intimidation attempts. 
In 2013, he was abducted for six hours. 
The intensive two-week course included a visit to the Federal Foreign Office.

In the internal and cross-border conflicts of the last decades, the large majority of casualties, especially among the civilian population, were caused by small arms. 
“The situation in Libya continues to be a source of grave concern to us. 
Fourthly, people smugglers and human traffickers’ criminal activities can only be combated effectively if towns and villages along the route have economic opportunities. 
Due to the massive influx of weapons and ammunition from Libya, the fight against proliferation remains a central issue in many African countries. 
Strengthening national small arms commissions 
It will be used to provide food and primary health care to refugees. 
In addition, UNHCR wants to expand freely accessible alternatives to detention centres and to support people in need in more remote areas in Libya by providing them with urgently required aid. 
Statement by Foreign Ministers Gabriel and Le Drian on the award of the Franco‑German Prize for Human Rights 
Foreign Ministers Sigmar Gabriel and Jean‑Yves Le Drian issued the following joint statement in Paris today (4 December): 
Our two countries are underscoring the universality of human rights by awarding the Franco‑German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law this year to 15 laureates from around the world. 
This is the second year in which France and Germany are awarding the Franco‑German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law to coincide with Human Rights Day on 10 December. 
This year the awards will be presented to the winners by the French and German Ambassadors in the countries where they live.

She is the founder of Advocacy Forum, a national NGO monitoring and documenting the cases of human rights violations systematically, offering free legal advice to the victims and working to raise awareness to prevent violations. 
The agenda for the first week in Berlin included a visit to the Federal Ministry of Defence, a meeting with the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces and various cultural events, alongside teaching units. 
New ideas and greater mutual understanding 
Problems ranged from easily remedied issues such as more knowledge about didactics to equip course participants to pass on to others what they had learned, to visionary and more comprehensive political concerns. 
Selebatso Mokgosi from INTERPOL did not support this idea, as he felt there were more problems with coordinating the various donors and projects. 
More aid for Somalia 
All participants left with new ideas and greater understanding for one another. 
Practical training at the Federal Armed Forces Verification Centre 
In the second week, the training group visited the Federal Armed Forces Verification Centre in Geilenkirchen, which has been conducting PSSM training courses in Africa for many years. 
There, the focus was on practical exercises with the course participants. 
The very fruitful talks were continued during a joint luncheon. 
High-ranking leaders from African small arms commissions have taken part in a training course in Germany.

Information on the group 
On 16 November the group, consisting of members of the police force, the military and various regional organisations, visited the Federal Foreign Office, where they were greeted by Deputy Federal Government Commissioner for Disarmament and Arms Control Susanne Baumann and the Head of the Division for Conventional Disarmament, Marcus Bleinroth. 
Silver Maari, a Lieutenant in the Ugandan security forces, proposed targeting the training at higher ranking leaders and inviting political decision-makers to participate in such courses. 
Course content included how to handle weapons that had been collected and how to destroy them, or how to store them correctly and safely, if they were still usable and if this was desired.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (4 December): 
This is why we are providing 120 million euros in funding, 
thus boosting the EU Trust Fund for Africa, which has significant shortfalls as regards funding for North Africa and especially Libya, 
and helping to facilitate the implementation of the conclusions of the AU‑EU Summit in Abidjan. 
France has made a start by accepting a first group of 25 people, who were initially flown from Tripoli to the Niger, from where they are due to travel to France. 
One aim of the additional funding is thus to help Libyan towns and villages, which are mostly very poor outside the oil‑rich regions, to create legal jobs and earning opportunities. 
The funding includes 20 million euros to boost UNHCR’s humanitarian protection and aid measures in Libya, thus ensuring that refugees receive urgently needed support. 
The additional funding will also enable the EU and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which will receive an extra 30 million euros in the near future, to do far more to help migrants who want to return to their country of origin. 
IOM has already helped 13,000 people to return home voluntarily and now plans to significantly increase this support. 
In providing additional funding, Germany is also complying with the call by the European Council of 19 October to ensure sufficient and targeted funding for the EU Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) by December. 
Germany is providing a total of 100 million euros to the EUTF. This includes the above‑mentioned 30 million euros for IOM. 
In addition, UNHCR will receive 20 million euros, as mentioned above.

German assistance for reconciliation and stabilisation 
Safeguarding progress 
Germany is increasing its contribution to the United Nations Trust Fund for Somalia by over three million euros. 
Much is at stake in this country, where civil war has been waged for decades. 
The Federal Foreign Office has decided to provide another three million euros of aid. 
This brings its contributions to the United Nations’ endeavours to bring peace and stability to Somalia to more than ten million euros. 
Germany further supports the stabilisation process in Somalia by offering targeted mediation services and reconciliation support in local conflicts. 
Germany’s comprehensive efforts to support Somalia include contributing to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) for the country, 
which is managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
a sum which will be augmented by a further 3.25 million euros by the end of 2017. 
The Federal Foreign Office works with specialist partners to actively strengthen national small arms commissions, which are striving to control weapon flows, prevent further proliferation and create binding legislation. 
Within the context of a regional programme in the wider Sahel region conducted by the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), 22 small arms control representatives from Africa were invited to Germany. 
The humanitarian situation remains precarious.

After 20 years of civil war, even that is to be considered a success. 
The international community thus cannot afford to let up in its efforts for Somalia. 
Germany and its international partners are currently employing a wide range of instruments to underpin both this process and political progress in general. 
Germany provides support in many different fields, such as establishing a federal system in Somalia, reintegrating former al‑Shabaab fighters, forming a federal police force, and fostering democracy and the rule of law. 
The German Government is also providing assistance in the security sector, both bilaterally and within the framework of the United Nations and the European Union, under the Common Security and Defence Policy. 
Germany contributed 7.7 million euros to it already in 2016, 
Germany’s contribution to the Trust Fund is earmarked for crisis prevention efforts and for building structures that strengthen peace in Somalia. 
For example, the National Electoral Commission will receive funds to prepare the first nationwide general election, which is due to be held in 2020 or 2021. 
through the funding of projects such as police training programmes and capacity building in the justice sector. 
The focus of the two-week training course was on Physical Security and Stockpile Management (PSSM) – a fundamental aspect of improving weapon-handling. 
The development of rule‑of‑law structures will also receive financial support 
Duration of presentation 60 minutes / 90 minutes 
Both were interested in how the Africans rated the implementation of PSSM projects and how strategies could be targeted to further improve physical security in the long term. 
In a lively discussion the groundwork that PSSM represents was commended as an important basis, but attention was also given to exploring farther reaching avenues. 
Colonel Nema Sagara from Mali, for example, stressed the importance of raising awareness, which could play a crucial role in changing people’s mindset with regard to the use of weapons. 
Sanni Mama, head of the multinational troops with units from the armed forces of Chad, the Niger and Nigeria, called for the causes of arms proliferation to be tackled and for a greater focus to be placed on good governance in Africa, where, after all, no weapons were manufactured. 
Close cooperation in turbulent times 
Alongside North Korea and Ukraine, cooperation with the EU was on the agenda. 
Crisis concerning North Korea’s nuclear and missile programme

North Korea’s ruthless pursuit of nuclear weapons is currently a source of particular concern. 
The ongoing North Korean missile and nuclear tests which contravene UN Security Council resolutions do not just threaten the stability of the region but could, given the range in question, also reach other parts of the world. 
North Korea is unfortunately only one example. 
But here we need Russia, the United States and China to cooperate. 
Only those three can effectively put a halt to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.” 
Defence capabilities and dialogue 
Gabriel meets NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg© Michael Gottschalk/photothek.net 
The Foreign Minister is convinced that we need to maintain dialogue with Russia on this question and others, such as North Korea and Syria. 
“At the same time, we know that Russia is pursuing a policy which many in NATO find unsettling.” To have more security and transparency, we need defence capabilities and deterrence while offering dialogue. 
More cooperation between EU and NATO 
NATO will also benefit from the EU’s most recent decisions to strengthen cooperation within Europe on security and defence policy. 
“That is not directed against NATO and certainly not against the United States but we all know that we will have to take more responsibility for ourselves in the future,” as Foreign Minister Gabriel underscored in Brussels. 
For Gabriel there is no doubt: “We need to talk about how to deal with the danger of further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world.

Autumn meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers: 
On Tuesday (5 December), Sigmar Gabriel travelled to Brussels to discuss how to meet the current challenges with the other NATO foreign ministers. 
Together with NATO partners, pressure for a political solution must be maintained and increased by tighter sanctions. 
Following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, a considerable amount of trust has been lost. 
“Together with Russia, we want to try to find possibilities for a peacekeeping mission in eastern Ukraine to finally bring about a ceasefire,” as Gabriel explained. 
Telephone and fax: 
The EU agencies Europol and Eurojust also have limited access to the system. 
You may exercise this right in all states in which SIS II is used, regardless of which member state issued the alert. 
Germany does not have any shorter response times. 
Right to request information 
The procedure for requesting information is based on national regulations. 
Contact details: 
Only once this state has had an opportunity to comment on the disclosure of the data to the applicant is the BKA entitled to provide information concerning the data or to refuse to provide such information. 
The competent authorities must respond to requests for information as soon as possible and no more than 60 days after the date of the request. 
Information must be provided unless: 
Right to correction and deletion of data 
Jens Stoltenberg has served as Secretary General of NATO since 2014. 
His four-year term comes to an end next year. 
Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has issued the following statement: 
“Secretary General Stoltenberg’s outstanding work has demonstrated that he is modernising NATO and laying the groundwork for a successful future for the Alliance. 
The international security environment has changed considerably in recent years. 
Berlin Foreign Policy Forum – Europe in a less comfortable world. 
Speech by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at the Körber Foundation’s Berlin Foreign Policy Forum 
In a speech at the Berlin Foreign Policy Forum, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel presented three options for a new global system. 
The collapse of states creates a new balance of power 
Federal Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen has issued the following statement: 
“Jens Stoltenberg is an outstanding Secretary General and has Germany’s full support. 
Not only has he done great work modernising NATO and adapting its structures to reflect the changed security situation. 
Joint statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel and Defence Minister von der Leyen expressing Germany's support for extending Jens Stoltenberg's term as NATO Secretary General 
Germany will continue to support the Secretary General in these endeavours.” 
Jens Stoltenberg is also a major promoter of closer cooperation between NATO and the European Union.” 
The competent authorities in Germany help process the request by exchanging information and carrying out the necessary checks. 
Reasons should be given for the request and all relevant information enclosed. 
Legal redress 
This authority thereupon reviews its original decision to determine whether it should be changed, thereby providing relief itself. 
The application should be made directly to the agency which created the alert. SIRENE Germany (based in the BKA in Wiesbaden) will tell you which this is. 
Applicants in Germany may also take their complaints to the competent data protection supervisory authority at any stage. 
If the complaint raises issues affecting two or more countries, the relevant national data protection authorities will cooperate to guarantee the affected person’s rights. 
They must respond to requests for correction or deletion as soon as possible and no more than three months after the date of the request, informing the person what action they have taken. 
If national regulations provide for shorter response times, those shorter times apply. 
keeping it confidential is necessary for the protection of public security and order, or 
the data or the fact that it is stored must be kept confidential on statutory grounds or to protect overriding rights and freedoms of third parties. 
If information is not disclosed or if the applicant doubts the accuracy of the information provided, they may contact the federal data protection supervisory authority. 
Legal redress is provided in accordance with national law. 
In Germany, applicants must first file a complaint with the authority they had contacted about the data. 
If it abides by its original decision and continues to refuse to provide information or to correct or delete data, the complainant may file an action with the competent administrative court to compel the authority to grant the request. 
Germany is in favour of extending his term in office by another two years. 
In this difficult phase, Jens Stoltenberg has led the Alliance with success and with a clear compass. 
That holds true with regard not only to relations with Russia but also to enhanced cooperation between NATO and the EU. 
In the wake of Trump’s decision regarding Jerusalem: 
Jerusalem: view of the Temple Mount 
“Even in good times” the status of Jerusalem had not been up for debate, said Gabriel, because it was a question to be decided “between the Palestinians and Israelis right at the end”. 
The fact that the US has now taken a unilateral stance on this sensitive issue, continued the Minister, risked pouring oil on the flames. 
Gabriel stressed that Germany was not going to move its Embassy: 
The status of Jerusalem 
As a result, no other state has to date recognised Jerusalem as the sole capital of Israel. 
If the relevant alert was created by an authority from another state, only that state may correct or delete the data. 
If an alert issued by a federal agency is in question, applicants should contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (contact details above). If the alert was created by a Land (federal state) authority, you should contact the data protection authority of that Land. 
Germany stands by the two‑state solution 
In the wake of President Trump’s announcement that the US recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Foreign Minister Gabriel has reaffirmed Germany°s commitment to the two‑state solution. 
President Trump announced on Wednesday evening (6 December) that the US would officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and start the process of moving its Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
“We stand by the two‑state solution and believe that the question of Jerusalem’s status must be clarified between the parties to the conflict right at the end of the process.” 
East Jerusalem has been occupied by Israel since 1967. In 1980 Israel declared the whole of Jerusalem, including the occupied area of East Jerusalem, to be its “eternal, undivided capital”. 
In the Oslo Process in the 1990s, Israelis and Palestinians agreed to determine the final status of Jerusalem in final status negotiations. 
So all foreign missions in Israel are in Tel Aviv and the surrounding area, and not in Jerusalem. 
Foreign Minister Gabriel said that, even in the wake of Trump’s decision, Germany and the European Union needed to stick to their own positions on the Jerusalem issue. 
He announced that he would be discussing the matter further with his European partners in the next few days. 
“This will be an important item on the agenda” at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 11 December, continued the Minister. 
keeping it confidential is indispensable for the relevant authority to perform its tasks in connection with an alert (e.g. police investigations) 
This authority will review the case in detail and will inform the applicant whether their rights have been respected. 
The Second Generation Schengen Information System II (SIS II) 
SIS II is an information system that enables the law enforcement agencies and administrative bodies of the Schengen states to exchange information and thus perform certain activities. 
The Schengen states are currently collecting information from two main areas in SIS II: 
Alerts on third-country nationals for the purpose of refusing their entry into or stay in the Schengen area on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of 20 December 2006; 
Alerts on missing persons and on persons or objects related to criminal offences for the purposes of police and judicial cooperation on the basis of Council Decision 2007/533/JHA of 12 June 2007. 
If your personal data is stored in the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), you have the right to request access to that data and to make sure that it is accurate and lawfully entered, or, if not, to request correction or deletion. 
In Germany, it is Division ZV 34 of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) which provides information about whether data is in fact stored in SIS II and which authority is responsible for correcting or deleting such data. 
If a request for information concerns an alert that was not entered by a German authority, the BKA first has to transmit the request to the member state which entered the alert in SIS II. 
If personal data in SIS II is incorrect or incomplete, the person concerned has a right to have it corrected. 
If personal data is unlawfully stored in SIS II, the person concerned has a right to have it deleted. 
How Germany is helping refugees and migrants in Libya 
Libya 
Foreign Minister Gabriel with refugees detained in Libya, June 2017 
Germany has earmarked 120 million euros to help migrants and refugees stranded in Libya. 
Reports on the slave trade and the inhumane detention of hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees in Libya have shocked the world these past weeks. 
UNHCR worker with refugees in Libya 
Germany has therefore strongly urged the Libyan Government of National Accord to see that the authorities ensure refugees and migrants are treated humanely throughout the country. 
Support for voluntary repatriation 
International Organization for Migration staff in Libya 
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is therefore organising voluntary repatriations with German financial assistance. 
Years of armed conflict and bitter power struggles between numerous groups have wrecked state structures in Libya. 
Many regions are not controlled by the state, but by armed militias. 
Efforts to end instability in Libya 
More than 200,000 Libyans have been displaced within their own country. 
Stopping human traffickers and smugglers is thus very difficult. 
For this reason, Germany is working with the EU to bring greater stability to Libya. 
Germany supports a political unification process 
Germany and the EU have adopted a comprehensive strategy to end the suffering of the people in Libya. 
Opposing slavery, trafficking in human beings and illegal imprisonment: 
“Refugees in the country are still in desperate straits,” Foreign Minister Gabriel stated. 
For example, rescue services funded by Germany and the EU are scanning desert routes for refugees and migrants who have been left behind. 
Mobile healthcare services are being established, with support from the German Government, to care for the refugees, above all pregnant women and children. 
Many of the migrants want to return home because of the dreadful living conditions in Libya. 
Some of the people stranded in Libya left their countries of origin because of persecution. UNHCR is trying to organise admission to third countries for them, with Germany’s support. 
By providing healthcare and aid supplies they hope to improve conditions in the camps step by step. 
The aid organisations do not however have access to camps run by militias and human traffickers. 
If refugees can no longer remain in Libya because of a clear and present danger to life or limb, UNHCR will organise emergency evacuations and fly them out to neighbouring countries, where they await resettlement. 
Germany and its European partners are working together flat out to end the suffering of people stranded in Libya. 
Germany and the EU are making funds available so that aid organisations such as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) can provide on-site assistance to people in Libya. 
They are also to provide psychosocial counselling for victims of sexual violence and human trafficking. 
Courses are also being provided for returnees to help them find employment back in their home countries. 
This year, 13,000 people have already made use of this service, which will now be considerably expanded. 
Moreover, at the EU-AU Summit in Abidjan, African states announced that they would significantly accelerate repatriations by providing identity papers quickly and making more flights available. 
and is furthermore funding aid organisations which are active in the field of reconstruction and which ensure that the basic needs of the population are met. 
Thanks to German and EU support, aid organisations can also assist refugees and migrants in state-controlled detention camps.

Michael Roth with Radmila Šekerinska, Defence Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
Minister of State Roth encouraged his colleague not to slacken in her country’s moves towards reform and to aim for concrete results. 
The fields of the rule of law and good governance are particularly important in this connection. 
Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth met Radmila Šekerinska, Defence Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, at the Federal Foreign Office, Berlin, on 6 December. 
Their talks focused on the implementation of an ambitious reform agenda in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and on the Government’s positive steps in the region. 
Making further headway on reform 
Defence Minister Šekerinska outlined the current state of implementation and reaffirmed her country’s resolve to make further efforts so as to get closer to its goal of EU and NATO membership. 
Minister of State Roth encouraged his colleague not to slacken in endeavours towards reform and to aim for concrete results. 
He also assured her that the country could continue to rely on German support. 
Positive signals to the region 
Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office on Human Rights Day (10 December) 
One key signal, he said, was the conclusion of the good-neighbourly relations agreement with Bulgaria, for which negotiations had been under way for a long time. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (8 December) to mark Human Rights Day on 10 December: 
In 2017, the human rights situation in many parts of the world is still alarming. 
A worldwide phenomenon with which I am confronted time and again in talks with human rights defenders is the shrinking space for civil society. 
Our thoughts and sympathy are with the victims’ families and loved ones. 
For example, this became abundantly clear to me during a regional human rights seminar in Mexico last May. 
I am observing the increasing restrictions imposed on freedom of the press and of expression with great concern. 
This also applies to countries in our immediate neighbourhood, as developments in Turkey show. 
We support the United Nations in its efforts to swiftly investigate this attack and to bring those responsible to justice. 
Killing blue helmets is a war crime. 
In addition, Steinmeier will visit a hospital run by the Workers’ Samaritan Federation and the Amadou Bansang Jobarteh School of Music in Banjul.

In response to this I am working to encourage civil society players and support them in creating new spaces for their activity under the motto “creating spaces”, focusing on issues with considerable potential for societal transformation, such as education and health. 
The United Republic of Tanzania is one of the mission’s largest troop contributors. 
On the issue of capital punishment, too, we must remain vigilant to ensure that the progress towards worldwide abolition or a moratorium does not grind to a halt. 
The death penalty is an inhuman and cruel form of punishment. 
Germany rejects the death penalty under all circumstances and will continue to work with its partners in the European Union to actively campaign for its worldwide abolition. 
Another issue close to my heart is business and human rights. 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* 
At this difficult time, we stand side by side with the United Republic of Tanzania. 
Its mandate includes protecting civilians, stabilising the country and supporting a political transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Furthermore, Roth praised the positive signals the new Government had sent to its neighbours in the region since assuming office in June 2017. 
Roth and Šekerinska agreed that the improvements in the atmosphere with Greece were also important for creating the trust needed for new movement on the unresolved issue of the country’s name. 
Rapid progress now needs to be made on implementing the Federal Government’s National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights, the NAP, which was adopted almost one year ago. 
We condemn in the strongest possible terms the perfidious attack on UN blue helmets serving in the MONUSCO peacekeeping mission in North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It lists expectations regarding adherence to human rights due diligence that apply to all German companies, irrespective of their size and main business activity. 
I was pleased to present the German NAP at the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights in November, where the international audience greeted it with widespread interest and encouraged us to implement its ambitious goals. 
Next year, too, we must continue working to include women to a greater extent in all phases of conflict prevention and conflict management. 
This year in my role as Commissioner for Human Rights, I was particularly concerned with the conflicts in Yemen and Myanmar.

Access for humanitarian organisations to the suffering population must not be restricted; unfortunately we see this happening far too often. 
International humanitarian law must be respected. 
We must resolutely continue our engagement also in less widely reported crises (hashtag #nichtvergesser). 
The United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1948. 
Institutions and initiatives from Germany and the US are invited to participate. 
The aim of UNSCR 1325, which was adopted in the year 2000, and of the to date seven follow-up resolutions 1820, 1888, 1889, 1960, 2106, 2122 and 2242, is to include women to a greater extent in crisis prevention, conflict management and post-conflict peacebuilding and to protect them against violence in armed conflicts. 
The focus is on the long-standing transatlantic partnership and the question as to how Germans and Americans can inject fresh impetus into their friendship in the fields of political, scientific, economic, cultural and social life. 
These include

Initiatives and institutions have until 20 January 2018 to submit their projects and take part. 
Projects and events will be organised from the east to the west coast over the course of one whole year. 
Dialogue with American society, especially away from the big cities, is a priority. 
The aim is to raise the profile of Germany in the US and to make it more tangible, as well as to enter into a dialogue with the people of the US. 
Germany will assume the chair of this network in 2018 and host its annual meeting in Berlin. 
With this in mind, in 2018 Germany will assume the chair of an international network working specifically to implement the Resolution. 
Project proposals must be submitted online to the Goethe-Institut in Washington. 
According to the United Nations, at least 12 Tanzanian peacekeepers and five members of the Congolese armed forces were killed. Numerous peacekeepers were injured, and some of these are in critical condition. 
The courage and commitment with which UN peacekeepers perform their daily duties in the cause of peace and to protect civilians in crisis and conflict-ridden regions deserve our special recognition. 
MONUSCO (Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la Stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo) was established by the UN Security Council in 2010 and is currently the largest UN peacekeeping mission in the world.

I would like to use the occasion of Human Rights Day to spotlight several issues that have been of particular concern to me during the past year. 
The areas of economic, social and cultural rights in particular harbour great potential for change. 
Another “NAP” of great significance for my work serves the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. For no conflict can be overcome in the long term if half of the population is excluded from peacebuilding efforts. 
I had the privilege of introducing German initiatives in this area during a UN Security Council debate in October. 
On 11 January 2017, the Cabinet adopted the second Federal Government Action Plan to implement Resolution 1325 for the period 2017–2020. 
In 2016, on the fringes of the UN General Assembly, an international network – Women, Peace and Security Focal Points Network – was launched with the aim of supporting member states and regional organisations in their efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325 through experience-sharing.

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the situation in Syria 
They deserve our great respect for everything they have done to help overcome the enormous need. 
Lasting peace cannot be achieved by military means. Syria will only find stability through an inclusive political settlement. 
The United Nations’ aid programmes for Syria and the region are significantly underfunded. 
“No matter how much we wish there were peace after the long years of violence and conflict, the Syria crisis is not yet over. 
The ongoing fighting continues to affect many people with unrelenting severity, while the humanitarian situation remains dramatic.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ongoing fighting has forced millions to leave their homes. 
The Federal Foreign Office is providing a further 28 million euros to fund humanitarian aid projects in Central Africa. 
The money will be used to support the work of the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the priority countries the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. 
More than four million people have fled their homes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to other parts of the country or neighbouring countries as a result of ongoing armed conflicts. 
With this support from Germany, the World Food Programme will now endeavour to secure the livelihoods of people displaced from their homes. 
Germany has provided more than 400 million euros of humanitarian aid for the African continent in 2017 so far. 
In particular, Germany has played a major role in helping to overcome food crises in northeast Nigeria, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa, and has supported the life‑saving work of humanitarian partner organisations. 
Syria’s neighbouring countries, which provide so many desperate people with refuge and protection, continue to need our support. 
We thus call on Assad’s supporters, particularly Russia and Iran, to do their utmost to ensure that the regime finally meets the opposition around one table in Geneva, begins substantive negotiations and no longer blocks the path to a sustainable solution to the conflict.” 
The Federal Foreign Office is providing a further 15 million euros to the World Food Programme (WFP) to safeguard food supplies for hundreds of thousands of refugees in Lebanon and Jordan.

He said that it was now important to see concrete results, 
adding that a particular focus should be placed on the issues of the rule of law and good governance. 
Roth assured Dimitrov that the country could continue to rely on German support. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (11 December) on the situation in Syria: 
For this reason, the German Government is providing a further 120 million euros for humanitarian assistance in Syria and its neighbouring countries. 
Over 13 million people – two-thirds of the original population of Syria – need help to survive. 
Every day, we see images of starving children and almost indescribable destruction in areas that remain under siege by the regime such as Ghouta in eastern Damascus. 
Deprivation and humanitarian need are becoming increasingly evident in areas that are only now opening up to aid workers, the more IS is forced to retreat. 
In addition to providing people with food, medicine and other aid relief, humanitarian efforts are focusing on protecting groups that are most vulnerable, such as children, women and senior citizens. 
Before winter starts, UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) will receive an additional 60 million euros and the UN humanitarian funds a further 15 million euros to protect people in Syria and its neighbouring countries who are particularly in need and to provide internally displaced persons and refugees with warm clothing and accommodation that can withstand winter conditions. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) will receive a further 25 million euros and 5 million euros respectively. Palestinian refugees are one of the groups in Syria most in need of protection and support. 
In 2017, the German Government provided approximately 720 million euros in total for humanitarian assistance in the context of the Syria crisis, thus making it the second‑largest humanitarian donor in the world after the United States. 
He said that improvements in the atmosphere with Greece were also important for creating trust in connection with the unresolved issue of the country’s name. 
Importance of consistently driving forward implementation of reforms 
He also emphasised his country’s determination to undertake further efforts to move closer to the goals of EU and NATO membership.

Twenty years of Federal Foreign Office support for the preservation of the Angkor temple complex 
Working on a relief, Hans Leisen 
The largest temple complex in the world from the period of the Great Khmer Empire has been a World Cultural Heritage site for 25 years. 
This significant piece of humanity’s cultural heritage is under threat from weather damage. 
Germany has been supporting efforts to preserve the temple complex in Angkor for 20 years, providing 4 million euros to date through conservation measures by TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences. 
Angkor Wat is a prominent symbol of Cambodia’s cultural identity, depicted on the Cambodian national flag and comprising one of the country’s most important attractions. 
Valuable reliefs as well as sandstone, tile and stucco decorations in the complex are under threat from weather damage. 
Germany’s 20-year engagement is to be acknowledged during the annual meeting of the International Coordinating Committee (ICC) in Angkor on 13 and 14 December 2017 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences and the Cambodian heritage protection authority Apsara, and with a symposium on the German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) established by the two experts Professor Leisen and Dr von Plehwe-Leisen on 15 December. 
With this, the Cultural Preservation Programme’s most comprehensive and longest running project, the Federal Foreign Office, in cooperation with its Cambodian partners, is helping to preserve one of the most important World Cultural Heritage sites, the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia. 
Since 1997, German conservation experts Professor Hans Leisen and Dr Esther von Plehwe-Leisen from TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences, in cooperation with the Cambodian heritage protection authority Apsara, have been taking steps to document and investigate the weather damage as well as conducting conservation work based on scientific methods on the temples. 
Experts, local residents and partners are involved in implementation and, where possible, trained in the fields of conservation, restoration and digitalisation.

The residency is also funded by a grant. 
Yu will explore the topic of the wanderer from the mystic peregrinations of Buddhist monks to the global refugee movements of our day. 
For her residency at the Federal Foreign Office, she will work on a video performance aimed at exploring how the values and ideas of democratic communities are translated into images. 
Every year, three artists are given the opportunity to work and exhibit in what is perhaps the highest studio in Berlin, 
thus turning the roof studio and surrounding terraces at the Federal Foreign Office into a forum where art and foreign policy meet. 
Every year, a jury of independent experts chooses three artists, who are invited to spend three months working in the roof studio at the Federal Foreign Office. 
The residency is primarily aimed at artists who come from abroad or focus on global topics in their work. 
At the end of the residency, the artists’ work is exhibited at the Federal Foreign Office and in their own gallery. 
In her work, the installation, video and performance artist deals with images that constantly reappear in modern media.

The Chinese‑German painter, photographer and film maker was born in Beijing and studied at the Berlin University of the Arts. 
His project for his residency at the Federal Foreign Office will be about global migration movements. 
Manaf Halbouni was born in Damascus and graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts Dresden. 
His sculpture of three vertical buses, which was shown in Dresden and Berlin, sparked a debate on the artistic exploration of the civil war in Syria. 
During his residency at the Federal Foreign Office, Halbouni will address the role of colonial history in relations between Europe and the Middle East. 
Federal Foreign Office on the lifting of the ban on cinemas in Saudi Arabia 
The Federal Government welcomes the recent decision by the Saudi Arabian Government to permit cinemas to open in Saudi Arabia as of early next year. 
This is a further important step in the process of opening the country’s culture. 
The Federal Government is following with keen interest the rapid economic and social transformation of Saudi Arabia that is taking place in pursuit of the Vision 2030 plan that was presented by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
The fitting way to support this opening is by strengthening cultural exchange. 
We will continue to proceed down this path, together with Saudi Arabia. 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (13 December) on the Saudi Arabian Government’s decision to permit cinemas to open in the country: 
On 11 December, the Saudi Arabian Government decided to lift the ban on cinemas that had been in place in Saudi Arabia since the early 1980s. 
This is part of Vision 2030, an ambitious economic and social reform programme. 
It includes modernising Saudi Arabia’s economy, strengthening the rights of women, a moderate interpretation of Islam and expanding cultural freedom. 
Contributing to reconciliation in the region 
By participating in the Janadriyah cultural festival in Saudi Arabia in 2016, the Federal Foreign Office has made an important contribution to enhancing dialogue between both societies. We have also worked to steadily expand the framework for vibrant exchange with young Saudi Arabian artists and culture professionals. 
I have intensively supported RYCO from the outset. 
Global responsibility – the Bundeswehr in international peace missions. 
13 December 2017 – Article 
The crises around the globe will not wait for a new German Government to be formed. 
In order to achieve this, we need further reconciliation and better exchange in the region. 
Overview of the extended mandates: 
UNMISS (South Sudan) 
UNMISS also supports the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. 
UNAMID (the Sudan) 
The joint United Nations-African Union peace mission UNAMID is tasked with protecting the civilian population, facilitating humanitarian assistance and supporting the peace process. 
MINUSMA (Mali)

By stepping up the promotion of EU values, we are also promoting democracy, the rule of law and economic development in these countries in our immediate neighbourhood. 
Resolute Support (Afghanistan) 
Training mission in Iraq 
Germany is supporting the Iraqi security forces in their fight against the terror militia “Islamic State”. 
At the WBIF Steering Committee meeting in Frankfurt am Main on 13 December 2017, Digital Infrastructure was added to the WBIF’s sectors of activity. 
Germany takes part in air-to-air refuelling and reconnaissance. 
That is why the German Bundestag has extended the mandates for seven international peace missions. 
Germany is thus signalling clearly to its international partners and allied troops that it also remains a reliable country while its new Government is being formed. 
“Many countries expect Germany to use its influence to foster peace and stability,” Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. 
On behalf of the United Nations Security Council, UNMISS is responsible for protecting the civilian population, observing the human rights situation and ensuring access to humanitarian assistance. 
The stabilisation mission MINUSMA safeguards peace in Mali. 
The United Nations peacekeeping forces deployed by the United Nations Security Council monitor adherence to the ceasefire and promote confidence-building measures between the parties to the conflict. 
The mission is also tasked with facilitating humanitarian assistance, protecting human rights and helping to rebuild Mali’s security forces. 
The aim of the mission is to train the security forces and provide guidance on logistics and medical care. 
Operation Sea Guardian mission monitors maritime areas in the Mediterranean region, contributes to the capacity-building efforts of the coastal states and provides support in the fight against terrorism. 
Federal Foreign Office increases support for the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) by nearly 600,000 euros 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (13 December) on the nearly 600,000 euro increase in support for the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF): 
The WBIF has proven to be an efficient instrument for EU Pre‑accession Assistance for the countries of the Western Balkans that generates great leverage. 
Therefore, the Federal Foreign Office has decided to top up its 2017 WBIF contribution by nearly 600,000 euros, to a total of 1.6 million euros. 
With this strong support for the process of drawing the six Western Balkan countries closer to the European Union, the German Government is underscoring its interest in greater economic momentum in the countries of the Western Balkans. 
It is in our interest for important reforms to be successfully implemented in the Western Balkans. 
In addition to development of the private sector, projects in the environment, energy and transport sectors, as well as projects that benefit society at large, are being supported. 
The Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) was officially established, following Council approval, in December 2009 as a joint initiative of the European Commission, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. 
To date, Germany has contributed more than 11 million euros. 
The German Bundestag has extended the mandates for the Bundeswehr’s participation in seven international peace missions until spring 2018. 
These mandates would otherwise have expired at the end of January 2018. 
Following the attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015, the German Bundestag voted to support the Global Coalition against Daesh with military means. 
At their Warsaw Summit, NATO Heads of State and Government decided to establish a new maritime security operation in the Mediterranean. 
It is also intended to support and complement the EU’s efforts, in particular EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia, for example by helping to implement the arms embargo on Libya. 
In 2018, approximately 16,000 NATO and operational-partner service members will be deployed to the Kabul area, as well as in four regional spokes. 
[Grafik/Karte] Overview of the extended mandates 
Responsibility worldwide: mandates for peace missions extended 
Saudi Arabia is very concerned about Iran. 
It was with this in mind that we also clearly condemned the Iranian missile tests as they are not in line with Security Council Resolution 2231. 
Our position, like the position of the European Union, remains unchanged: a solution to the status of Jerusalem must be found through negotiations. 
We firmly believe that a negotiated two-state solution that meets the aspirations of both sides is the only realistic way to achieve lasting peace and security. 
Neither can we tolerate Islamophobia in our countries. 
In order for Israel and Palestine to be able to coexist peacefully, the leaders of both sides must have the courage to say that the other belongs here. 
It is very important to me that there be no misunderstandings here. 
I want to make that clear. 
That is why stability and peace are so important in Lebanon. 
All of us, Germany, Europe, the United States and, of course, the countries of the region, must work together to safeguard peace and stability in Lebanon. 
I am quite sure that this objective is also shared by our friends in Saudi Arabia. 
We are moving in the same direction on important foreign policy issues, for example in the fight against so-called “Islamic State”. 
We will keep a close eye on whether everyone keeps this promise.

The Regional Youth Cooperation Office of the Western Balkans: Promoting reconciliation, youth mobility and EU membership

Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth received a delegation from the newly founded Regional Youth Cooperation Office of the Western Balkans at the Federal Foreign Office on 5 December. 
Youth exchange, good-neighbourly relations and reconciliation in the region: these are the aims supported by RYCO, the new Regional Youth Cooperation Office of the Western Balkans. 
We condemn terrorist violence in the strongest possible terms. 
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia signed the Agreement on the Establishment of the Regional Youth Cooperation Office in Paris in the summer of 2016; it is now taking up work and will support a wide range of projects for young people in the Western Balkans in the future. 
More than 400 project applications were submitted in response to the first call for proposals – a great success. The first contracts are to be signed at the end of January. 
Support from the Franco-German Youth Office 
Germany will continue to support Somalia in its endeavours to create stability, build up the police force and combat terrorism. 
From the very start, RYCO has been assisted by the Franco-German Youth Office (FGYO). 
Hardly anyone would have thought that possible until only recently. 
Markus Ingenlath, General Secretary of the FGYO, stated that the new organisation would continue to receive active support. 
Minister of State Roth said: “Germany attaches particular importance to regional cooperation and therefore established what is known as the Berlin process. 
It is one of the most tangible results of our commitment in the Western Balkans. 
I am pleased that RYCO’s first projects will be funded at the beginning of 2018. 
Only with the help of the young generation can the Western Balkans have the prospect of EU membership. 
The Regional Youth Cooperation Office can make a valuable contribution in this regard.” 
That is impressive. 
But this is about much more than economic reforms. 
And his success will also be a model for the entire region. 
Germany has a strong interest in a united and strong Gulf Cooperation Council. 
It is with this in mind that we want to achieve as quick a solution to the crisis as possible. 
Only the countries in the region can resolve the crisis. 
In Europe, former enemies first became partners, and even friends today. 
People are being bombarded, displaced and starved every day. 
Take eastern Ghouta, for example. 
The regime is preventing the United Nations from being able to distribute food and medication there. 
And why? 
For tactical reasons. 
That is more than cynical. 
Germany has already done much to reduce the suffering of the people in Syria. 
And yet this is not enough as long as the conflict continues. 
Berlin and Riyadh certainly have similar views as regards their analysis of policy. 
Like Saudi Arabia, we are most concerned about Iran’s foreign policy role in the region. 
I made this point abundantly clear in Washington quite recently. 
As far as Lebanon is concerned, we share Saudi Arabia’s concern about the role of Hezbollah as a militia and about its role in the region. 
Quite frankly, it is breathtaking to see the courage, resolve and energy with which Saudi-Arabia is changing right now. 
For many, this does not fit with their traditional image of Saudi Arabia, which is informed by clichés. 
Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is opening up his country for the 21st century. 
We enjoy excellent relations with all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and intend to continue in this vein. 
By the way, a historical experience made by Germany and Europe is perhaps of interest to the Arabian Peninsula, even though we differ in many ways. 
Our history shows that, despite the catastrophes and the historically unprecedented immense suffering of the Second World War, it was possible to start anew. 
This shows what people are capable of if only they are willing. 
Contrary to what some people are saying these days, the Syrian crisis is far from over. 
Hundreds of thousands are trapped, many of them women and children. 
“And later on, I didn’t have the time because I had to sell water in the city to feed my family.” Ten people depend on his earnings. 
This resolution was adopted also with Russia’s approval. 
such as inspecting vehicle documents and registration plates, setting up road blocks for checkpoints at particular places and finding addresses without help. 
It contains key elements for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and for building a regional security framework. 
In order to achieve lasting peace, it is not enough to accept that the other is here to stay. 
I have seen that my comments on the crisis in Lebanon have not been accepted in Saudi Arabia, 
which is why I am most grateful to you for asking this question. 
My personal and our political concern in Germany was only directed at the people of Lebanon. 
Our relations are so important and strong that we will surely be able to cope with having different views on individual issues from time to time. We must not allow ourselves to be divided! 
Our strategic objective must be to persuade Iran to refrain from such actions and for it to act constructively. 
“That was the best I could do at the time.” 
For almost three years now, we have been seeing a reform process between the Red Sea and the Gulf, which is being followed here in Germany not only with interest, but also with great respect and goodwill. With its Vision 2030, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is showing how to respond proactively to difficult challenges such as the rapid drop in the price of oil and the need to diversify the economy. 
One example can be seen in Afghanistan, 
“Instead the driver showed me an electricity bill, as I found out later.” He pretended to check the papers, then nodded and let the wanted man go. 
We have contributed over 700 million euros for humanitarian aid measures in this year alone. 
This is why we need a political solution at long last – under the auspices of the United Nations and on the basis of the relevant resolutions. 
We have emphasised time and again that two sides are needed for negotiations. 
At the end of the day, the shape that Syria’s political future is to take is something that the Syrians themselves must agree on. 
Our objective in Yemen – and we are on the same page here – is the restoration of peace and stability and the return of the legitimate government to Sana’a, as well as the protection of the Yemeni people. 
through inclusive negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Special Envoy, whose efforts we are lending our full support. 
Mogadishu was today hit by yet another serious attack, the latest in a series over a short period. 
At least 15 police officers died in a suicide bombing of a police academy, and others were severely injured. 
We extend our sympathy to the families and friends of the victims at this difficult time and wish the injured a speedy recovery. 
Saudi Arabia is the biggest humanitarian donor in Yemen, which is a fact that is unfortunately sometimes forgotten in Germany. 
At the same time, Germany is also one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid in Yemen – which is also perhaps not sufficiently well known in the region. 
“Afghanistan is now a completely different country than it was after liberation from the Taliban.” Security and the refugee situation are currently the main causes of destabilisation. Half a million Afghans are internally displaced persons (IDPs), 
He can now read the duty roster on his own, issue penalty notices and write records of police interviews. 
If they were attacked, they often would have no other choice but to defend themselves, as he explains. 
The world’s refugee crises cannot be resolved by individual countries alone. 
The reports on human trafficking in Libya are shocking. 
These steps will be closely coordinated with the Libyan Government of National Accord, which must take responsibility for ensuring that refugees and migrants in the country are treated in a humane manner. 
The opposition admitted as much in Riyadh recently. 
Finding a solution here that takes even better account of legitimate Saudi security interests is a challenge that we must overcome together with the active support of the United Nations. 
The issue of displacement and migration – and that includes immigration from conflict zones and Africa – continues to be very high up on the international agenda. 
The Global Compact for Migration offers a historically unique opportunity to establish an international framework for safe, orderly and regular migration. 
This is impressive, and clearly also thanks to Saudi Arabia’s untiring efforts and to the work done by my good friend and counterpart Adel Al-Jubeir in particular. 
If Russia genuinely wants to see a lasting political solution for Syria, it should get the Assad regime to move at long last – in Geneva, where the political process belongs. 
Negotiations on a political transition do not take the resignation of Bashar al-Assad as their starting point. 
and are also deeply concerned by the killing of Saleh, as well as by recent developments in Sana’a. 
It is important to implement the measures that were agreed on in Abidjan without delay and to ensure that allegations of slavery in Libya are investigated swiftly. 
However, they would like to see significant improvements, as police officers reflect society as a whole, where the vast majority of people – some 70 percent – cannot read or write or are only semi-literate. 
The GIZ team takes action as soon as five police officers want to attend a course, 
“Topics range from defining a police officer’s actual role to human rights, equal opportunities, the environment and health.” So far, 80,000 police officers have attended the GIZ’s literacy classes 
All those who are committed to resolving the conflict between Israel on the one hand and the Palestinians and the Arab states on the other must take these elements into account. 
At the same time, I would like to make it quite clear that there is no justification whatsoever for inciting hatred against Jews or for calling Israel’s right to exist into question. 
My comments on the Lebanon crisis were not about taking any particular country in the region to task – that includes Saudi Arabia. 
Time and again, foreign powers have also plunged the country into crises and violence. 
Together with the United States, we want to work to counteract the problematic role played by Iran in the region – without jeopardising the nuclear agreement. 
And we believe that it is possible for all parties to come together when they get round the same table. 
And so I am pleased that an important first step towards bringing the region together was taken in Kuwait. 
We stand ready to offer our support in areas where we can be of assistance. 
I am referring to Resolution 2254 here in particular, which sets out a clear framework. 
In Geneva, we have an opposition that is united and constructive and prepared to engage in unconditional negotiations. 
On the other hand, we have the Syrian regime, which blocks, protracts and distracts and does not budge one inch. 
I am not sure what impact a change of location would have upon this. 
However, I can understand the opposition’s objection to the notion of allowing the country to continue to be ruled by a man who has fought mercilessly against his own people. 
The conflict can only be resolved in the long term by political means – 
We are aware of the fact that a permanent threat posed by the arming of a militia such as the Houthis with ballistic missiles is unacceptable to Saudi Arabia. 
We condemned the Houthis’ missile attack on Riyadh in the strongest possible terms 
In order for this aid to get to where it is needed, it is essential that ports in the north be fully opened up again to humanitarian and commercial supplies. 
On the basis of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants adopted by the United Nations on 19 September 2016, two global compacts on refugees and migration are currently being developed – projects to which we are strongly committed. 
The Federal Government therefore supports the international division of responsibilities, protection of human rights and respect for international agreements on the protection of refugees. 
The people of Lebanon have had to make enormous sacrifices and, at the same time, the country offers protection to many refugees from Syria today. 
Interview with the Saudi newspaper Al-‑harq Al‑Awsat 
How do you see the announcement by US President Donald Trump to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and what are the political and security implications internationally and regionally? 
Saudi Arabia set out an important peace vision with the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002. 
How do you view the reality and importance of Saudi‑German relations? 
I am old enough to remember the devastation of the 15‑year civil war in Lebanon from 1975 to 1990. 
I also recall the Lebanon War in 1982. 
It is important to make this clear as German‑Saudi relations are not only of great importance to us bilaterally, but are also important for the region. 
The fact that Prime Minister Hariri has returned to Beirut and has managed to convince all Lebanese parties to commit themselves to a policy of dissociation is a positive step. 
How do you assess current reforms in Saudi Arabia, especially Vision 2030? How do you see this in Germany? 
Germany has never taken sides in the conflict, but has always supported Kuwait’s mediation efforts and the initiatives of the US. 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Yemen and recently increased our humanitarian aid to a total of 165 million euros for 2017. 
On the fringes of the EU‑AU Summit in Abidjan, Europeans and Africans agreed in very constructive talks to improve the situation of refugees and migrants in the country. 
Germany is endeavouring to stabilise crisis-hit countries. 
while around 600,000 Afghans had to leave Pakistan in 2016 alone and return to their home country. 
“Only police officers who can read and write are able to apply the law,” he says. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (15 December) on the human rights situation in the Philippines: 
The increasing threats against those who stand up for the preservation and protection of human rights in the Philippines is particularly alarming. 
This responsibility means that rule-of-law principles must be applied in the fight against drug-related crime. 
A unique cultural heritage site: 
How Germany is helping to preserve the unique temple complex in Cambodia. 
Since President Rodrigo Duerte took office in July 2016, thousands of people have been killed in the so-called war on drugs. 
According to official figures, 3900 people have been killed in the fight against drug-related crime since Duerte took office. Human rights organisations estimate the number of fatalities at well over 10,000. 
Angkor Wat. 
What does the Federal Foreign Office do? 
Statement by the Human Rights Commissioner on the human rights situation in the Philippines 
The German Government calls on the Philippine Government to safeguard the freedom and protection of civil society.” 
We are Germany’s eyes, ears and voice abroad. 
Although the number of deaths has fallen recently, the so-called war on drugs has claimed thousands of lives so far and these deaths have not been investigated by the criminal justice system. 
As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Philippines has a particular responsibility to uphold human rights. 
“The human rights situation in the Philippines is a source of concern for several reasons. 
All deaths related to such crime must be investigated. 
Civil society plays an essential role in protecting human rights in a system based on the rule of law. 
Threats against human rights defenders cannot be downplayed as a joke. 
Almost none of these cases have been investigated by the criminal justice system. 
Important discussion in Kreuzberg: 
No place for anti-Semitism in Germany! 
An important discussion: 
Gabriel at the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism 
This makes the German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) the most comprehensive and longest running project of the Federal Foreign Office’s Cultural Preservation Programme. 
On Thursday (14 December), Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel participated in a discussion with representatives of Berlin’s Muslim community at the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism. 
Lively debate 
Anti-Semitism in day-to-day life in Berlin, the slogans from the demonstrations in recent days and political developments in the Middle East conflict – Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel discussed these and other subjects in Kreuzberg with actors from Berlin’s Muslim community. 
Gabriel and Aycan Demirel, co-founder of the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism 
The lively debate was an important exchange that lasted almost two hours. 
“That was the most important appointment I had today,” Gabriel said. 
The meeting took place on the premises of the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism. 
Participants included not only members of the Initiative but also Muslim migrants and actors from the religious, cultural and social spheres. 
Special responsibility for Israel 
“Anti-Semitism goes against our constitution,” Gabriel stressed at the beginning of the debate. 
Germany had a special responsibility for Israel, he went on. 
The third pillar is cultural relations and education policy. 
It was not just a matter of demonstrating tolerance towards the Jewish community, but of recognising the State of Israel’s right to exist. 
That being said, it obviously also had to be possible on this basis to criticise Israeli policy, Gabriel continued – as regularly happens, for instance in relation to settlement activities. 
Civil society plays an important role 
They agreed that civil-society groups such as the Kreuzberg Initiative against Anti-Semitism have an important contribution to make in dismantling prejudices and building up stable relations by bringing people into contact with each other and facilitating a frank exchange in which there is room for criticism. 
During the ICC, Apsara and TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining future cooperation, and the members of the Cambodian project team received certificates for their participation in the project. 
Through its Cultural Preservation Programme, the Federal Foreign Office has supported some 2800 projects in 144 countries since 1981. 
Experts, local residents and partners are involved in implementation and trained in the fields of conservation, restoration and digitisation. 
Angkor Wat, which was designated a World Cultural Heritage site in 1992, to this very day testifies to the cultural golden age of the Khmer empire, which from the 9th to the 14th century was centred in Cambodia. 
Angkor Wat still stands as a prominent symbol of Cambodia’s cultural identity. It is even depicted on the Cambodian national flag and is one of the country’s most famous attractions. 
However, due to the tropical climate, this important World Heritage site is constantly susceptible to weather damage. 
That is why the Federal Foreign Office has been supporting efforts to preserve the temple complex in Angkor for 20 years, providing 4 million euros to date to conservation measures conducted by TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences, in cooperation with the Cambodian heritage protection authority Apsara. 
Measures to conserve sandstone, brick and stucco reliefs are being carried out by local restoration workers. 
To this end, the two German experts train Cambodian staff in conservation techniques and scientific working methods. 
Federal Foreign Office condemns use of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine 
We cultivate political relations with the rest of the world and foster economic, cultural and academic cooperation. 
Every year, our embassies and consulates provide support to around 40 million travellers as well as four million Germans living abroad. 
The work of the Federal Foreign Office is based on three pillars: 
One of the most important tasks here is cooperation with the countries of the European Union. 
Our goal: a strong, integrated Europe in a globalised world. 
Alongside European integration, the transatlantic partnership with the United States is a key element in German foreign policy. 
The second pillar is foreign trade and investment policy. 
We help German companies to open up new markets abroad and promote sustainable business. 
The stationing of artillery in inhabited areas of eastern Ukraine puts the local civilian population at huge risk. 
political relations with states around the world are the cornerstone. 
We are deeply concerned about the renewed increase in fighting in eastern Ukraine. 
The states affected often cannot help their population on their own. 
They need international support: humanitarian assistance. 
Humanitarian assistance is based on four principles: 
Germany is engaged along with France, in the Normandy format, in working for the resolution of the conflict. 
It is impartial, that means that every party that needs help gets it. 
It is neutral: aid workers do not take sides in crises and conflicts 
We urgently appeal to all sides at the next meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk on 20 December to reaffirm the ceasefire and take the necessary steps to stabilise it. 
It is independent: the only goal is to relieve suffering. 
Humanitarian assistance is immediate relief for those experiencing acute hardship. 
This is what differentiates it from development assistance, which is geared towards longer-term goals. 
In Germany, the Federal Foreign Office is responsible for humanitarian assistance. 
Germany provides humanitarian assistance in many different ways: 
Emergency aid, for instance in the form of drinking water supplies or the provision of emergency shelter. 
Disaster risk reduction: 
People suffer great hardship when faced with food shortages, armed conflicts, cholera outbreaks, natural disasters and epidemics. 
Humanitarian assistance is not aimed at achieving any political or economic goals. 
the principle of humanity: the aim is to alleviate human suffering wherever possible 
Immediate relief in the case of sudden disasters, for example earthquakes. 
through the installation of early‑warning mechanisms and the training of humanitarian aid workers on the ground. 
From our headquarters in Berlin and Bonn, we boost Germany’s profile and represent Germany’s interests in the world through the around 230 missions abroad. 
It is the Government’s responsibility to protect civil society groups and political activists, in particular against potential threats to which they are exposed as a result of their work. 
They have a detrimental impact on the Philippines’ international reputation as a country that has undertaken to observe rule-of-law principles and uphold human rights. 
All the participants were agreed that there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany. 
In response to criticism by local human rights organisations and the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines of the brutality used in the fight against drug-related crime, President Duerte has repeatedly issued threats. 
20 years of German support for the restoration of Angkor Wat 
Germany is helping to train conservation experts. 
Academic exchange, German schools abroad as well as the promotion of German as a foreign language are key instruments in helping to ensure that people around the world regard Germany as a partner. 
In the Angkor temple complex, the fragile reliefs in particular, as well as the valuable sandstone, brick and stucco decorations are susceptible to weather damage. 
At present, the German Government is supporting projects in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and the Lake Chad region, for instance. 
During the annual meeting of the International Coordinating Committee (ICC) in Angkor on 13 and 14 December 2017, Germany’s 20-year engagement was marked with a reception hosted by Ambassador Karsten and a symposium on the German Apsara Conservation Project. 
Since 1997, German conservation experts Hans Leisen and Esther von Plehwe-Leisen from TH Köln/University of Applied Sciences, in cooperation with the Cambodian heritage protection authority Apsara, have taken steps to document and investigate the weather damage and have conducted temple conservation work based on scientific methods. 
It’s the largest religious monument in the world: 
Every day claims victims from both the civil population and the parties to the conflict. 
We condemn the use of heavy weapons, including the incident in the early hours of 13 December in Popasna (Luhansk region), which endangered lives, also those of seven members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. 
December alone has seen 17 dead and 37 injured so far.

Multilateralism or the nation state? 
Institutions that work versus charismatic or authoritarian leaders? 
Inequality or social cohesion? 
Under the mandate approved by all 57 OSCE participating States, all sides are obligated to ensure the OSCE monitors’ safety and to guarantee them unhindered access. 
The Convention is having an impact 
Under the motto “Latin America in the context of international trends” experts from Latin America, the United States and Europe took part in discussions with German diplomats, with the aim of drawing up concrete conclusions for formulating Germany’s policy on Latin America. 
National crises, international challenges 
Foreign Minister Gabriel on the court ruling concerning the release of Mesale Tolu from pre-trial detention 
Moreover, Germany and Brazil have traditionally worked closely together on combating climate change and shaping the multilateral order. 
Moves towards political dialogue with the opposition are marked by profound mistrust. 
The Venezuelan crisis is also paralysing the work of Latin American countries in international organisations. 
Nevertheless, Brazil remains “half of everything” in the region, to quote one participant. 
There are more German companies in the Brazilian metropolis of São Paulo than anywhere else in the world outside Germany. 
In contrast, the situation in Venezuela is shocking. 
Detecting and clearing mines with the most modern equipment – Germany supports mine clearance efforts in Albania 
The annual Meeting of the States Parties that got under way on 18 December is a good opportunity to take a look at what has been achieved thanks to the Convention. 
These perfidious weapons pose a threat to life and limb for the local population and are preventing humanitarian access, as well as the safe return of internally displaced persons and refugees. 
In connection with these efforts, the German Government has further increased its budget for the clearance of mines, IEDs and other ordnance. Germany has thereby become one of the largest global donors in this sphere. 
clearance, support for victims, awareness-raising among the population in the affected countries, and public relations work to educate the general public about the core elements of the Convention. 
A special focus of the projects promoted by Germany in 2017 was on areas in Iraq that have been liberated from the so-called Islamic State, which are severely contaminated by landmines, IEDs and unexploded ordnance. 
By providing assistance in Iraq, the German Government is also demonstrating its determination to help achieve the vision that is set out in the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, namely a world free of landmines by the year 2025. 
This does not mark the end of the court proceedings, but it is a first major step in the right direction. 
This is not only good news but also a huge relief. 
Peace: 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 December) on the ruling by a Turkish court that Mesale Tolu be released from pre-trial detention: 
I am sure that everyone in Germany, including myself, share Mesale Tolu’s happiness about the court’s ruling. 
Federal Foreign Office on the situation in Syria’s eastern Ghouta 
We are very concerned about the disastrous humanitarian situation in Syria’s eastern Ghouta. 
20th anniversary of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention 
Celebrating the 20th anniversary of a great achievement in the fight against landmines: 
this year, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (Ottawa Convention) turns 20. 
The agreement that was reached by a group of countries, including Germany, in Ottawa in December of 1997 on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on the clearance of these weapons was a milestone in international law and in the effort to eliminate anti-personnel mines. 
With 162 countries meanwhile having signed the Convention, it is now nearly universally applied. Moreover, it has led other countries that have not yet become States Parties to implement important parts of the Convention even today. 
The provisions of the Convention are having an effect. 
Global stockpiles are currently estimated to have dropped below 50 million, and trade in industrially produced anti-personnel mines has virtually stopped. 41 countries have completely halted production. 
As for Germany, it has destroyed 1.7 million anti-personnel mines, meaning that it no longer possesses any of these weapons. 
As one of the first signatories to the Convention, Germany also supports other States Party as they work to meet their legal obligations. 
This year, Germany contributed approximately 75 million euros to these efforts, or more than doubled the amount that was allocated last year. 
The funds go to projects that span the entire spectrum of anti-landmine efforts, namely 
Germany’s focus: areas in Iraq that have been liberated from IS

Foreign Minister Gabriel on the death of Russian human rights activist Arseni Roginski 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (18 December) on the death of Russian human rights activist and winner of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Arseni Roginski: 
I was greatly saddened by the news of Arseni Roginski’s death. 
Despite many appeals, the Syrian regime is not allowing the evacuation of those in need of medical treatment. 
Furthermore, the urgently needed medial evacuations must be permitted. 
Like no other, Arseni Roginksi embodies the past and present of the Russian civil rights movement. 
He was a political intellectual, renowned historian and a passionate human rights activist whose life’s work was devoted to the fight for pluralism and against the dangers of nationalism – both of which are aims that have lost none of their urgency in our societies today. 
We therefore support the political process facilitated by the United Nations and the Geneva talks. 
The German Government is supporting the political process and the Geneva talks on the basis of Security Council Resolution 2254. 
Ministry draft 
The regime has used this cynical and inhumane tactic before in Aleppo and in many other cities in Syria. 
It is clear to us that 
The International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for prosecuting the most serious crimes, which affect the international community as a whole. 
The Rome Statute defines the crime of aggression as the fourth crime for which the International Criminal Court is responsible. 
Significant progress in the development of international law has thus now been achieved. 
The Charter of the United Nations’ prohibition on the use of violence, as the heart of the international legal order, has now also been reinforced under international criminal law. 
Statement by the Federal Foreign Office on the activation of the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, as agreed at the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute. 
Under the Rome Statute, these crimes are genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
While Brazil’s economy is slowly recovering, the country’s serious domestic policy crisis continues. 
These and other major questions of our time were discussed at the Latin America conference at the Federal Foreign Office on 7 and 8 December 2017. 
The new priorities in US foreign policy and the growing influence of China also have an impact on Latin America. 
In this context and in the run‑up to the super election year – in 2018, more than a dozen Latin American countries will hold a general election – the conference provided foreign policy makers with an opportunity to exchange views openly with academics and to make use of their expertise. 
The event, which was opened by State Secretary Walter J. Lindner, focused on two countries that are important in German foreign policy for very different reasons: 
Brazil, the largest and most populous country in Latin America, and Germany’s only strategic partner in the region; and Venezuela, which is in the grip of a severe political, economic and humanitarian crisis whose effects can be felt all over Latin America. 
For Germany, this means not least that Brazil is its most important business partner in Latin America and a major location for German companies. 
Instead of seeking a way out of the severe economic crisis and humanitarian emergency, the Government is focused on retaining power and is engaging in political confrontation. 
As a founding member of the Memorial society, which is committed to human rights and to addressing the history of Stalinism, Arseni Roginski not only built up a European network for independent historical analysis, but also made a major contribution to deepening relations between the civil societies of Germany and Russia. 
In 2010, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his work. His warm-heartedness, sense of irony and modesty will be remembered by all who knew him personally. The Federal Government will continue to support Memorial and other human rights organisations that are working, as Arseni Roginski did, to ensure that those who are persecuted and discriminated against have a voice. 
Early summer meningoencephalitis. 
Although this area east of the capital Damascus, which is under siege by the Syrian regime, lies in one of the“ de‑escalation zones”, it is estimated that 400,000 people are trapped there with no access to humanitarian assistance. 
Instead of providing assistance, the regime is leaving the population to starve and bombards it with air strikes and artillery fire on a daily basis, also targeting hospitals and schools. 
We condemn the attacks and the continuing siege of eastern Ghouta and – in implementation of the Astana agreements – call for humanitarian access to be guaranteed in the “de‑escalation zones” with immediate effect. 
We believe that Russia in particular, as a supporter of the Assad regime and guarantor of the Astana principles, has a responsibility here. 
only a political solution can bring durable peace to Syria and alleviate people’s untold suffering. 
Some 12 percent of people living in eastern Ghouta are suffering from malnutrition. 
According to the United Nations, 572 individuals, including just under 140 children and 65 young children under the age of five, are in a life-threatening condition and need to be evacuated immediately for medical treatment. 
Some 15 individuals have already died due to a lack of treatment. 
In 2017 alone, the German Government has provided more than 300 million euros for humanitarian assistance in Syria. 
In view of its own history, and as a firm supporter of international law, Germany has constantly taken part in these negotiations. 
Federal Foreign Office Press release 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (18 December) on the activation of the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, as agreed at the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute: 
“During the very last night of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, an historic decision was reached at the end of last week as regards activating jurisdiction over the crime of aggressive war. 
At the same time, the decision, on which consensus was reached, sends a firm political message of continued support for the International Criminal Court." 
However, no agreement could yet be reached on this in 1998, as some countries objected. 
Following difficult negotiations, it proved possible to activate jurisdiction over the crime of aggression at the Assembly of States Parties in New York. 
Very few people know what that is exactly. 
In Kazakhstan, the researcher Karlygash Abdiyeva has just received an award in recognition of her research into the spread of these dangerous biological pathogens. 
Abdiyeva and her exciting project came to his attention at a youth forum on scientific research. 
The award is a success for the close scientific cooperation between Kazakhstan and Germany in the field of biosecurity. 
German-Kazakh biosecurity network wins innovation award 
It is intended to help partner countries monitor biological security threats. 
Such threats can, for example, take the form of the intentional misuse of pathogens or toxins or, as in the case of the research done by Abdiyeva, the hazardous spread of a dangerous illness. 
I don’t know. 
Bärbel Kofler, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (19 December) on the latest use of the death penalty in Japan: 
I was shocked to hear that the death penalty has again been carried out in Japan. 
The execution of individuals who were minors at the time of the crime is a breach of international human rights standards. 
Federal Foreign Office on the renewed missile attack on Riyadh 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (19 December) on the renewed missile attack on the Saudi Arabian capital by Yemeni Houthi rebels on 19 December 2017: 
There can be no justification for such an act. 
The missile attacks on Saudi Arabia must finally stop. 
That is why the Federal Government is continuing to lend firm support to the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen. 
The Yemen conflict can only be resolved by diplomatic means. 
This is the second missile attack on the Saudi capital launched from Yemen. 
Human Rights Commissioner Kofler on the latest use of the death penalty in Japan 
We condemn the renewed missile attack on the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia launched from Yemen in the strongest possible terms. 
The Yemeni Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for today's missile attack on Riyadh, saying the target was the palace of the Saudi Arabian Government. 
On 4 November, a missile was intercepted near Riyadh airport. 
On 1 December, a further missile was launched from Yemen targeting Asir province in south-western Saudi Arabia. 
The Federal Government condemned both attacks in the strongest possible terms. 
On 19 December 2017, two people were executed in Japan, one of whom was still a minor under Japanese law at the time of the crime. 
This brings the number of people executed in the country since December 2012 to 21. 
Two individuals who had been sentenced to death were executed in Japan on 19 December 2017. 
One was 44 years old and the other 69 years old; both men were sentenced to death for multiple murders. 
Both convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court. 
The 44 year old was 19 at the time of the crime and was thus a minor under Japanese law. 
Following a case in 1997, this is the second time that an individual sentenced to death and executed was still a minor at the time of the crime. 
A total of 21 people have now been executed since Prime Minister Shinzō Abe took office in December 2012. 
Those sentenced to death do not know about the imminent execution until immediately beforehand and thus have no opportunity to say farewell to their families – 
At its annual general meeting in October 2016, the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations clearly stated its opposition to the death penalty for the first time and called on the Government to introduce life sentences and to end capital punishment by 2020. 
The number of countries that have abolished the death penalty or no longer carry it out is growing – 
This further military escalation by the Houthi rebels will only aggravate the conflict further. 
The Rector of Turan University (2nd from left) presenting the innovation award to Karlygash Abdiyeva (on the right) 
The doctorate student Karlygash Abdiyeva recently received the Astana Ardagym innovation award for her research within the framework of the German‑Kazakh biosecurity network. 
Kazakh President Nazarbayev himself nominated the scientist for the Astana Ardagym innovation award. 
The German‑Kazakh biosecurity network has been run under the auspices of the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office since 2013. 
It is one of several projects of the German Partnership Programme for Excellence in Biological and Health Security. 
The programme initiated by the Federal Foreign Office in 2013 is part of the Federal Government’s preventive security policy. 
The energy transition in Germany 
To my mind, 
this is actually all about 
whether we, as Germans, 
as Europeans, 
also as NATO, but first and foremost 
as Germans and Europeans, 
whether we really believe 
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,980 
that we get on better 
Or whether it isn’t more realistic 
to reach out to the world. 
for us to see that we also need 
if we keep our distance from the world. 
Our motivation and goals 
It represents the decision to fully overhaul Germany’s energy supply, 
moving away from nuclear energy in favour of renewable energy sources. 
At the same time, the plan is for this energy to be used ever more efficiently. 
There are good reasons for the Energiewende 
It aims to make Germany more independent of oil and gas imports in the long term. 
In order for the Energiewende to become an ecological and economic success story, energy must remain affordable and the supply secure. 
Today we are facing major challenges and there is still much to do. 
Renewable energies: 
Three years of German membership of the OSCE Troika 
The energy supply in Germany is becoming greener every year. 
Looking back on three exciting years of intensive cooperation on issues that concern the 57 participating States of the OSCE from Vancouver to Vladivostok. 
The Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) has laid the foundations for this successful development.

In the past, when Faizullah, a 38-year-old police officer from the Afghan capital Kabul, had to locate a suspicious vehicle, he had almost no chance of success, as he was not able to read or write. 
The goal is to strengthen state institutions 
Police officer Faizullah from Kabul: “I didn’t learn to read or write because of the war.” 
he attended one of the police literacy courses provided by Germany in Afghanistan with the aim of stabilising the security situation in the country. 
To date, the Federal Foreign Office’s Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance has provided some 27 million euros in funding to the programme. 
In response, the Federal Foreign Office has provided some 11 million euros to help refugees in the past three years. This funding has been used in projects for IDPs and returnees. 
Around half of the aid provided to Afghanistan by the Directorate-General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Post-Conflict Peacebuilding and Humanitarian Assistance – some 91 million euros – has been allocated to the security and police sectors, as a lack of security is one of the main reasons why people flee. 
This was also reflected during Germany’s OSCE Chairmanship, with around 300 events and over 1000 participants at the OSCE Ministerial Council in Hamburg, including 90 heads of delegations and 42 foreign ministers. 
“If police officers are not well educated, people feel less secure,” says Georg Fritzenwenger, manager of the police literacy training project at the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in Kabul, which runs the programme on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. Several hundred female police officers have also attended the literacy classes. 
They only leave if they fear for their safety,” for example when laws are no longer upheld or rebels are making advances. 
The Chairmanship was a challenge not only with respect to organisational considerations, but also as regards content.

making more of energy 
The economical and efficient use of electricity and heat saves money, increases security of supply and protects the climate. 
Energy efficiency is therefore the second pillar of the Energiewende. 
by 2020 it aims to reduce the total consumption of primary energy sources by 20 percent compared to 2008. 
Germany has set itself clear goals here: 
Much has already been achieved towards this target. 
Energy consumption in Germany now stands at its lowest level since 1990. 
Nevertheless, much remains to be done. 
Aid that makes a difference: 
Access for aid workers remains problematic 
Seven years after war broke out, millions of people remain dependent on assistance. 
almost 40 percent of energy consumption in Germany accrues here. 
The key instruments here are energy advice and construction supervision, grants and loans at favourable rates for building renovation. 
The transport sector also needs to make an appropriate contribution to the goals of the Energiewende. 
Many people there are in urgent need of medical assistance, including above all women, children and the elderly. 
Germany second-largest humanitarian donor 
The Trilateral Contact Group, chaired by the OSCE, meets representatives of Russia and Ukraine in Minsk on a regular basis in order to make progress on tangible implementation measures. 
This is why the Federal Government is also taking numerous measures in this area to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions of vehicles. 
At a donor conference in Brussels in April, Germany reaffirmed its support for the people in Syria. 
An electricity market for the Energiewende 
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission is the eyes and ears of the international community on the ground in Ukraine. 
The Austrian Chairmanship has successfully led the OSCE through a difficult year. 
because renewable energies do not feed electricity evenly into the grid. 
When the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, flexible gas power stations, for example, will step into the breach and ensure a reliable flow of electricity. 
There are, however, other possibilities that can play their part in balancing the volatile input. 
Although the Vienna OSCE Ministerial Council was once again dominated by the conflict in Ukraine and the violation of OSCE principles by Russia (in particular the illegal annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine), it was also able to reach important consensuses on cyber policy, small arms control, economic participation, human trafficking and the fight against sexual exploitation of children. 
This step is necessary because the Energiewende will completely redraw the energy production map in Germany. 
The nuclear power stations, however, are gradually being phased out by 2022. 
As yet, local renewable energies cannot compensate on their own. 
Large amounts of green power will therefore have to be transported from the wind-rich north to the south and west.

The Federal Government has therefore created the legislative framework to enable transmission system operators to develop their lines faster, in a more coordinated manner and with less bureaucracy. 
Citizens will be fully involved in all phases of planning and development. 
“Afghanistan’s development is irreversible,” says Thomas Zahneisen, former German Chargé d’affaires in Kabul and long-serving Head of the Stabilisation Division in Berlin. 
Literacy measures for the Afghan police 70 percent of all police officers are unable to read or write 16 percent have only basic literacy skills Since 2009, 80,000 police officers have learnt to read and write The Federal Foreign Officer has provided 27 million euros for literacy training so far This is one of 63 projects in the Stability Pact for Afghanistan 
Cooperation between stakeholders 
This allows for a single-source energy policy. 
Germany, which held the Chairmanship in 2016, was a member of the Troika from 2015 to 2017, latterly together with Austria and Italy. 
The high point – the 2016 OSCE Chairmanship 
The OSCE not only brings together a highly heterogeneous group of states, but also focuses on a very broad range of topics: 
human and civil rights (third dimension) 
politico-military issues (what is known as the first dimension) 
Humanitarian aid for Syria: 
Germany is the second-largest humanitarian donor in the region where 
millions of people are dependent on humanitarian assistance. 
Now, it has extended the relevant resolution until January 2019 so that those in need in Syria can continue to receive the assistance that is so urgently required. 
In addition to providing people with food, medicine and other aid relief, humanitarian efforts are focusing on protecting groups that are most vulnerable, such as children, women and senior citizens, and on accessing the areas under siege. 
OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine 
Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany are continuing to hold discussions on the implementation of the Minsk agreements in what is known as the Normandy format. 
The 24th OSCE Ministerial Council in Vienna on 7 and 8 December 2017 
Germany was represented by Special Representative of the Federal Government for the OSCE Chairmanship Gernot Erler, who wrote the following in his guest comment for the “Wiener Zeitung”: 
“Two issues in particular are currently of paramount importance for the OSCE: the efforts to resolve the conflict in and around Ukraine, and security and arms control initiatives to strengthen trust and cooperation in the OSCE area.” 
The Structured Dialogue on current and future security challenges in the OSCE area will continue to provide important impetus for cooperative security, also under Italy’s OSCE Chairmanship in 2018.

The Troika consists of the current OSCE Chairmanship, which changes at the beginning of each year, as well as the previous and succeeding Chairmanship. 
The Ministerial Council in Vienna offered a very vivid demonstration of the humanitarian situation endured by civilians in the conflict zone, who depend upon support from the OSCE, the International Red Cross and the United Nations. 
“I always dreamed of joining the police.” But he explains it is only now he is able to do his job properly. 
The Energiewende can only succeed at European level and requires international partners 
On Tuesday (19 December), the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate for cross‑border humanitarian assistance for Syria for another year. 
The humanitarian aid organisations of the United Nations and their partners are thus reaching those needing help directly. 
Given the difficult conditions in Syria, the Security Council first allowed cross‑border aid to be supplied from neighbouring countries in 2014. 
The situation is particularly precarious for 400,000 Syrian civilians in eastern Ghouta. Ongoing fighting has meant it has not been possible to get assistance to them since mid‑November. 
In 2017 alone, the German Government provided approximately 720 million euros in total for humanitarian assistance in the context of the Syria crisis and, as co‑chair of the Brussel’s conference on Syria, motivated others to donate. 
Since 2012, the Federal Foreign Office has made available a total of almost 2 billion euros for humanitarian projects in the region. 
At the 24th OSCE Ministerial Council in Vienna on 7 and 8 December 2017, it made its final appearance in this format. This occasion was an opportunity to look back on three exciting years of intensive cooperation on issues that concern the 57 participating States of the OSCE from Vancouver to Vladivostok. 
Germany successfully pursued new and creative approaches to strengthen dialogue within the OSCE, such as inviting business representatives to the conference on connectivity and scheduling a performance by Daniel Barenboim and his West‑Eastern Divan Orchestra at the opening of the Conference on Tolerance and Diversity. 
Another part of this are the newly established OSCE Informal Ministerial Meetings, the first of which was held in Potsdam under the German Chairmanship. At these meetings, foreign ministers have an opportunity to address current problems in the course of in‑depth discussions. 
Thirty observers from Germany are currently working for the mission, which is primarily responsible for monitoring compliance with the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. 
In this format, the OSCE participating States will continue to discuss important politico-military issues such as perceptions of threats, armed forces and military exercises in border regions, thereby helping to rebuild urgently needed trust through dialogue, in particular with respect to Russia and the West. 
Germany will remain an active player in helping to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia also above and beyond the Troika. 
This means millions of people in the north‑west and south of the country are to receive further life‑saving assistance. 
The humanitarian situation in Syria remains dramatic.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on the current challenges in global politics, and on Europe’s position in the world. 
What effect has this had on you? 
Suffering, war and hunger. 
The energy markets in Europe are growing ever closer together. 
more choice, lower prices and a higher degree of supply security. 
The larger the common market, the better fluctuating supplies of wind and solar energy can be compensated. 
Nevertheless, an internal European market can only function if energy flows to where it is needed. 
Often, however, there is still insufficient capacity available in existing power and gas lines. 
In particular, cross-border interconnectors need to be further developed and modernised. 
The Energiewende must be embedded in an ambitious European energy and climate policy. 
So the Federal Government welcomes the fact that the European Council has agreed on high-reaching climate and energy targets up to 2030. 
As a first step towards achieving this common climate goal, emissions trading is to be reformed. 
Germany will remain dependent on imported energy for the foreseeable future. 
The aim of Germany’s external energy policy is to ensure the long-term reliability and affordability of these energy imports. 
At the same time, Germany wants to find like-minded partners for the Energiewende both in Europe and worldwide. 
What poses the greatest threat to our way of life? 
Who is who 
A database for a better understanding of the Energiewende 
This “Who is who” database presents the most important stakeholders in Germany’s Energiewende, their tasks, functions and fields of work. 
If this continues, the law of the strong will supplant the strength of the law. 
BEDT 2017 
Is that why we need a United States of Europe? 
Europe must learn to be a major player in the world. 
to France, the United Kingdom and the US. 
The Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue (BETD) is a two-day international conference hosted by the Federal Foreign Office (AA) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). 
But that’s simply no longer possible. 
A unified Europe may be important – but it’s not really a burning issue for people on the street. 
The second BETD took place in March 2016 with ministers and high-level representatives from 74 countries. 
But this is not about more of the same – it’s about a different Europe. 
In the year of the German G20 Presidency, the conference helped to realise the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
“A Europe that protects”, as France’s President Macron says. 
Otherwise, our children will not have a voice in the world! 
Sharing experience and best practices can help us to learn from each other, make use of synergies and reach ambitious goals more quickly and more cost-effectively. 
Exhibition: 
Because it’s completely unrealistic. 
By cooperating on defence at EU level, we can save money and at that same time assume more tasks. 
The next German Government should not bind itself to achieving this target. 
We need greater cooperation and efficiency. 
That must change. 
If, for example, you want to stop displacement and forced migration, then you must invest in Africa with a view to improving education, the economy and general living conditions. 
Will you be a member of the next German Government? 
Or was your visit to Afghanistan just before Christmas your last trip as Foreign Minister? 
It may sound a bit old-fashioned, but it’s also important to simply perform the duties of your office, regardless of what lies ahead. 
That’s what we were elected to do. 
Is the drawn-out process of forming a new government hurting our country? 
Not domestically. 
Our institutions are much too strong for that. 
But we must work to prevent damage to our country’s image abroad. 
“This is not about more of the same – it’s about a different Europe” 
This, in turn, could cause our world order to crumble. 
In the past, we’ve left this role to others – 
At least not if the US becomes an unreliable partner, and if new powers like China arrive on the world stage. 
If by “United States of Europe” you mean the Europe we know today, then you may be right. 
The way to explain it is like this: China is growing, India is growing and Africa is growing. 
If your children want to continue to be heard, then it must be with a European voice. 
You’re calling for greater responsibility for Europe. 
Germany would need to double its defence budget. 
What’s more, it’s entirely unnecessary. 
In Europe today, we throw lots of money out the window simply because everyone does the same things and no one coordinates with the others. 
Also, creating a larger military does not automatically create more security. 
But it is a strange situation nevertheless. 
Has it changed your view of the world? 
Of all countries, the one that helped establish these rules – the United States – is feeling less and less responsible for them. 
But, compared to the rest of the world, we do live in an incredibly secure environment. 
They’re using a different playbook. 
They’re in a completely different league. 
And unlike us, they also have a global strategy. 
I don’t think it’s that hard at all convincing people about this new European idea. 
Why, then, have you expressed such strong reservations about NATO’s goal to have Allies spend two percent of their GDP on defence? 
But one thing’s for sure: 
Just because Germany is taking a long time to form a new government, the world hasn’t stopped turning. 
That’s why, at the Federal Foreign Office, we are of course continuing to plan for next year. 
Economic ministers travel the globe in search of economic opportunities for their country. 
Foreign ministers do that, too. At the same time, though, they’re confronted with many unpleasant things in the world. 
That’s also humbling. 
Anyone who feels overly secure is overlooking the great challenges. 
To put it in a light-hearted way, it’s helpful to have a Prussian attitude. 
An exhibition traces the long path to the Energiewende and clearly illustrates how it is changing everyday life in Germany. 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier opened the show in Beijing in early April; from there it will travel to various stops around the world, 
including Cape Town, San Francisco and Mexico City. 
The international profile of the Energiewende plays an important role in the exhibition. 
Visitors learn that many countries around the world are seeking to expand renewable energy sources and have already made considerable progress in doing so. 
The timeline that guides visitors through the exhibition begins back in 1971, with the Federal Government’s first environment programme. 
Will it cost jobs? 
Can it also succeed in countries whose economies are not as strong? 
At the end of the exhibition, should they wish, visitors can test their newly-acquired knowledge with a quiz, give feedback on the show via touchscreen or take a glance into the future, to the year 2050. 
A film shows what the everyday life of a family of three might be like: 
the son’s school bus is powered by hydrogen and there are charging stations for the parents’ electric car both in front of the family home and at the workplace. 
Future scenarios that are not actually all that far off.

To promote the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue (BETD), we have chosen the Green Energiewende Sofa as this meeting point. 
Federal Foreign Office on the signing of a ceasefire agreement for South Sudan 
A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (22 December) on yesterday’s signing of a ceasefire agreement for South Sudan: 
We welcome yesterday’s signing of the ceasefire agreement. 
Furthermore, we call on all parties to continue to play a constructive role in revitalising the peace agreement. 
As part of the High-Level Revitalization Forum under the auspices of the regional organisation IGAD, this is an important first step towards restoring peace in this country wracked by civil war. 
We therefore urge all stakeholders to implement this ceasefire agreement to the letter and in the long term and to ensure that humanitarian organisations are not hindered in their work. 
Around a third of the population of South Sudan has already fled their homes and the humanitarian situation in the country is catastrophic. 
The principle underlying these efforts is that, by promoting the exchange of information and military cooperation, the risk of conflict is reduced. 
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel issued the following statement today (27 December) on the successful exchange of several hundred prisoners in eastern Ukraine: 
Above all, it is also an important humanitarian gesture before the New Year and the Orthodox Christmas. 
This should now be followed up by further steps to implement the Minsk agreements. 
It is imperative that the Christmas ceasefire agreed to recently be strictly adhered to.” 
Statement by Foreign Minister Gabriel on the prisoner exchange in eastern Ukraine 
This exchange is a significant step in the implementation of the Minsk agreements, and one to which we lent our proactive support together with other French partners in the Normandy format. 
“The fact that, after months of negotiations, an extensive exchange of prisoners was achieved today is good news. 
The successful exchange of prisoners shows that this is possible. 
Of course, even in our country, not everything that glitters is gold. Here, we also have poverty and injustice. 
The most dangerous thing would be to believe that it will always be smooth sailing for us. 
The greatest danger we face is that the number of global political players who take a rules-based approach is steadily decreasing. 
There are no other options. 
Lastly, it would be a disaster if Germany desired to lead Europe not only economically and politically, but also militarily. 
And to get that, we need a stable government. 
You have been Foreign Minister for nearly one year. 
For this, we will soon need a more clearly defined policy on Europe. 
The first dimension – the politico‑military dimension – comprises security policy and military cooperation, including arms control in particular, as well as crisis and conflict management. 
Since mid‑2017, OSCE participating States have been engaged in a high‑level Structured Dialogue to address pressing politico‑military issues in the OSCE area. The aim, especially in view of the crisis between Russia and the West, is to engage in a dialogue and begin to rebuild trust. 
The conventional arms control regime of OSCE participating States is built on binding international agreements, such as the Treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe and the Treaty on Open Skies, as well as on Confidence- and Security‑Building Measures like those contained in the Vienna Document that aim to enhance military transparency. 
Home: 
The Energiewende (energy transition) is Germany’s path to a secure, environmentally friendly and economically successful future. 
The aim is for half of the country’s energy supply to be provided by sun, wind, etc. by 2030. 
By the middle of the century, energy consumption is to be reduced by half. 
The Energiewende aims to make it possible to phase out nuclear energy; the last nuclear power station in Germany will be decommissioned in 2022. 
It aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases harmful to the climate. 
It aims to become the driving force for investment and modernisation in Germany as a location for industry and to contribute to innovation, growth and employment. 
Only then will our citizens continue to support the Energiewende and only then will Germany remain competitive as a location for industry. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has therefore developed a precise timetable (10-point energy agenda) outlining and dovetailing the necessary measures. 
an essential pillar of energy supply 
While in 2000 only some six percent of electricity consumed came from renewable sources, today this figure is 31 percent. 
Germany is well on track to achieve the target of a 40 to 45 percent share by 2025. 
This promotion has transformed renewable energies from a niche product into one of the essential pillars of energy supply in Germany, and the cost of renewable energy technologies has fallen significantly. 
However, the rapid expansion of renewable energies has led to a steady increase in subsidies. 
For this reason the Federal Government has fundamentally reformed the EEG. 
This has enabled the development of renewable energies to proceed rapidly – well‑managed and in a cost-efficient manner. 
A further goal is the improved integration of electricity from renewable energy sources into the energy market. 
In future, renewable energies will increasingly have to stand up to competition. 
Future funding for wind, photovoltaic energy and biomass will no longer be set by the state, but rather determined by competitive tender processes. 
For this reason, the Federal Government is providing a wide range of information and advisory services as well as financing programmes to help private households, companies and municipalities use their energy more efficiently in the future. 
In order to further strengthen these efforts, the Federal Government has presented the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, 
which encompasses many new and improved measures for the more efficient use of energy. 
One key focus is the building sector, where there is potential for particularly high levels of savings: 
The Federal Government aims to make buildings in Germany practically climate-neutral by 2050. 
A new phase of the Energiewende is set to begin in the coming years: 
renewable energies will become the dominant source of power. 
For instance, flexible industrial companies can transfer their energy-intensive production phases to periods in which abundant electricity is available at low prices. 
Well‑developed power grids can balance fluctuations across regions and borders. 
In the long term, energy storage reservoirs can play an important role in reconciling electricity production and electricity consumption. 
The major task now is to organise the wholesale electricity market so that the power supply will remain secure and reliable in the future. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has presented a green paper containing proposals for public debate on how the electricity market can be adjusted to the requirements of the Energiewende. 
This represents the basis for a white paper, which contains specific proposals and prepares for the legislative process. 
Green light for grid expansion 
Several thousand kilometres of power lines need to be strengthened (or new ones built) to ensure that the whole of Germany can still be provided with secure and reliable electricity at affordable prices in the future. 
Over the course of many decades, nuclear and conventional power stations in southern and western parts of Germany have provided a major part of the power supply for the conurbations there. 
The existing overhead power lines, however, were not laid out for this purpose. 
To enable distribution networks to be locally developed and modernised, the Federal Government is improving the framework so that the 800 or so distribution network operators will be able to invest in this area in good time. 
A large number of stakeholders in government, industry and society are working together to ensure the success of the collaborative project that is the Energiewende. 
The effective coordination and close cooperation of all stakeholders involved are key requirements for the success of the Energiewende. 
The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is the lead ministry for the Energiewende. 
Five Energiewende platforms have been established, providing opportunities for continual and intensive exchange with industry, science, policymakers and society. 
Here, overarching strategies for the central fields of action ‑ energy networks, electricity market, energy efficiency, building sector as well as research and innovation ‑ are developed and discussed. 
The Federal Government undertakes comprehensive monitoring to check the progress of the Energiewende 
in order to recognise developments over many years and take countermeasures as necessary. 
This brings major benefits for electricity and gas customers: 
In order to avoid European climate and energy targets leading to excessive costs for industrial companies even after 2020, asset relief schemes for these businesses are to be continued. 
An intensified international dialogue can help improve the understanding of the Energiewende, dispel reservations and make use of synergies for a common climate-friendly energy policy. 
It is against this background that the Federal Government has developed numerous successful international energy dialogues and partnerships. 
In multilateral energy organisations and dialogue forums, it campaigns for competitively structured, open and transparent markets, the worldwide development of renewable energies, a global increase in energy efficiency, as well as climate protection. 
This database is intended to be a guide to help you better understand the Energiewende. 
You will find profiles and contacts for stakeholders in government, the energy sector, industry, science and research and civil-society organisations. 
All these institutions are helping to actively shape the Energiewende. 
The first Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue took place in Berlin in March 2015 and brought together some 700 participants from nearly 60 countries to discuss the transformation and the future of the global energy supply. 
In 2016, more money was invested globally in renewable energy sources than in fossil and nuclear technologies. 
Many countries have improved their energy efficiency, with digitalisation boosting this progress significantly. 
To aid these positive developments, the Federal Government brings together the global energy elite in Berlin to discuss experiences, best practices, challenges and plans for a global Energiewende. 
The 2017 BETD specifically explored how to attract increased investment flows into the public and private energy markets. 
It is planned to continue the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue in 2018. 
The Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue provides a platform for the necessary discussions between key stakeholders in the Energiewende worldwide. 
The aim of the conference is to foster international dialogue on a safe, environmentally‑friendly and cost-effective global Energiewende. 
What the Energiewende means for citizens and how it is changing daily life – these are the issues addressed in the Federal Foreign Office’s multimedia exhibition “Germany’s Energiewende”. 
147 states are members of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which Germany was instrumental in setting up. 
At the same time, the exhibition leaves no doubt that switching the energy system over to renewables is an ambitious political and technological project – and one that didn’t happen overnight in Germany either. 
The exhibition also addresses and clusters frequently‑voiced concerns about the Energiewende. 
Isn't the Energiewende too expensive? 
When they all arrive home in the evening, the washing machine has already washed the clothes from the previous day – automatically switching on when plenty of solar energy is available. 
In the coming months, you will find the climate-friendly Green Energiewende Sofa at all Energiewende hotspots. 
Furthermore, to some extent there has been such rapid growth the development of the requisite infrastructure – particularly the electricity grids – has not been able to keep pace. 
This will change the rhythm of the entire electricity system, 
We wish the injured a speedy recovery. 
It was launched by the German and Turkish Foreign Ministers in September 2006 to issue a joint signal.
